2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			absolutely wonderful ! for fairytale lovers , this is a must read ! basically it is a variation of cinderella , but with so many unexpected twists and turns you don not recognize it without thinking about carson levine does an exsquisite job of heaping all kinds of emotion into this book . you can not help but laugh at the jokes and cry during the goodbyes . there's the villains you love to hate and even suspense in some parts . the descriptions make you feel like you are really there ms levine describes the scenes with just the right amount of detail so you know exactly what is happenning but there's still room for you to use your you want to read something totally different than anything you have ever tried before , read this book . it's a quick read once you start it , you won not be able to put the book down . i would reccomend it to everyone !
1			i	sorry			dvds . i am sorry about this but dvds were all scratched box was all broken , which probably happened in the as you said good to very good ? sorry
1			product	good	mess	big			not packed well . arrived as a big mess . not worth returning it . would suggest a better packaging for mail . otherwise product is good
1			sepultura	old	bands	worst	corpse	suck			cannibal corpse sucks . cannibal corpse is one of if not the worst metal bands of the 80 s and 90 s todays metal is worse though , and this is coming out of a person who likes metal and listens to it more than anything else . i don not see how anyone could think this is deserving of anything over 2 stars . the guitar player is just playing the same chord over and over again and has way too much distortion for his own good , the drummer is just banging on the kit with hammers , and the singer , oh my lyrics are all about gore and crap . this band is just a bunch of posers . if you want death metal i suggest getting death , old sepultura , and obituary instead . cannibal corpse are posers .
2			price	incredible			excellent ! my favorite films remastered and on blu ray ! with the exception of the overwrought part 3 this is an excellent addition to my collection and at such an incredible price !
2			music	great	look	easy	collection	fantastic			music lover . for anyone who loves great music regardless of type this dvd is for you . the concert is very laid back but i believe that speaks to the quality of this performance , the music is so crisp and entralling that you don not need any flash . in addition to some of the band's well known hits like hotel california , i loved glenn frey's rendition of the girl from yesterday and don henley's soulful the last resort . my wife who never sits to watch tv cuddled up next to me to enjoy this fantastic collection of tunes by a group that makes it look all so easy . their encore presentation of desperado left me desparate for another dvd performance of this magnitute .
2			album	awesome	album	great	it	boring	songs	low	song	great	i	pleased	songs	best			a great album . kelly's album is awesome ! each song has a different style and feel to it so it's never boring . in my opinion the best songs are low , miss independent , just missed the train , beautiful disaster , and anytime . you thought wrong a duet with tamyra gray is also a great song . overall , i was very pleased with kelly's debut .
2			album	great			another great album . i never really had a doubt that i would love with teeth . trent reznor has never dissapointed me and i believe the only way he could would be to stop making music . people complain that this cd took five years to make but i read in a interview that he almost has another one done and plans on releasing it soon , maybe next year . but i think reznor has finally realized that he needs to come out of the dark and step into the light . what ever he decides to do or change , i will always be there to standing in line the first day to get . his work is really one of the only things i look forward to , so keep on rocking man .
1			hack	great	piece	stupid	fulci	great			overated turkey stuffing . after hearing how great this was from all the horror and zombie geeks i thought one day when i grew up i would finally get to watch it . i mean i have seen the shirts of that zombie with a worm in his eye and it looked frightening . boy this was a pure waste of .50 cents ! this is a stupid and over rated piece of junk . there is nothing original in this film and any direction is lacking from the great master fulci , great hack ? i have was disappointed so many times when renting from the cheap bins but occasionally there is something worthwhile but this isn not it !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			totally awesome ! i love the book . i couldn not wait until i had book 1 read so that i could go to book 2 which i just started .
1			it	stupid	book	great			too far fetched . this book would have been great if the author didn not have the killer stalking jane because she was the reincarnation of ciara , who is a ancient actress , it was stupid and i got real bored , real quick .
2			i	glad	dr	good			overall a good dr's kit . some of the items are a bit cheap , but my daughter has enjoyed playing with the kit , and i am glad that i purchased it for her .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			terrific book ! excellent story . well written , not predictable and an ending that brings the book to an appropriate close . i will be looking at other books by mitch albom .
2			truth	dramatic	feel	sorry	fiction	best	it	hard			when courage triumphed over despair . this book , written by col james nick rowe , is unforgettable . it speaks volumes about the ability of one man to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles of every kind . after reading rowe's account of his prolonged captivity , you just might find it hard to feel sorry for yourself , no matter how bad your circumstances . sometimes the truth is more dramatic than even the best fiction .
1			idea	good			clothes dryer . not a very good idea unless you are six feet tall . you have to tighten the lines with each use and i have to carry a stool outside to do this . also , even after tightening the lines , they still droop . if you want a clothesline , get two sturdy posts and stretch a wire !
2			education	true	school	high			true education . a book that should be read by all high school students , butch jones autobiography presents a wealth of accumulated knowledge . it is a lesson in economics , philosophy , and detroit history . butch jones , supreme teacher and urban philosopher , turns learning into a game .
1			pans	new			unhappy . not as good as said in the description , very uneven heating , slight overheating can spoil the pans . i am already looking for new pans . quite unsatisfactory
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			loved it . i know i m a late comer but had to say if you liked the movie , you will love the book . it's just as fast paced and action packed , but you will get more detail and back story . this is the first michael connelly book i have read and look forward to more .
2			masterpiece	incredible	purchase	best	music	new	artists	unknown			the essence of 4 d . back when i was 20 i found out that buying albums of unknown artists just by judging the cover is an amazing tactic to get to know new quality music . this is how i bought many 4 d albums , and this is how i discovered rhp . years after , already having all their albums , this incredible masterpiece is my best purchase ever . slow , weary music has never sounded so mature and wise in this pure selection of quality songs . with katy song melting slowly into your heart , and mistress sawing its way through , each and every one of the songs on this cd is , by its own , worth the expense of getting this album . no music lover can hear this album and remain indifferent . however , you must listen to it a few times before the full genius of this terrific band is absorbed . pure art .
1			return	previous			product was opened . not a review of the product itself , but the safety film on the top of the container was already torn off , so i must have gotten a previous return or something . into the trash it goes . first time i have had a problem like this on amazon .
1			it	cute			broke . it broke within a month but it's really cute . it's just fragile and not well designed to be run on long term . or maybe perhaps i got a defect product . not sure
2			movie	great			great movie . this was a very entertaining movie ! if you have been to college you will surely be able to relate to this film . definitely one you could watch over and over for years .
1			i	disappointed	quality	worst	bucks	extra	it	lucky			worst quality i have ever seen , not reliable . does not work on long hair dogs . if your dogs has long hair , do not even bother ! secondly it just falls apart . within a week the metal pins had fallen off so i needed to order more . after a month , the collar completely broke and it wont do any stimulation , it will only beep . it does not work 100 yards , it's lucky if it worked 4 feet . and if you live in a cold climate anything under 30 f the collar will stop working after being outside for 10 minutes . i was very disappointed . just spend the extra 40 bucks and buy one that you can use and rely on .
1			movie	terrible	plot	annoying	shia	old			awful . this movie was terrible . no plot , action was written by a 10 yr old shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name i m not going to bother to look up can not act and wasn not much to look at either .
2			suspense	little	it	great	movie	best no	catch	great	entertainement	good	looks	basic			good entertainement . above the average . as you may be reluctant to watch this movie , reading the story which looks pretty basic , you may expect a lot more than you is not the best movie of the year , but it was sure great and it went beyond all expectations . otherwise , this movie has absolutely nothing to do with memento flashbacks and anachronous stories have not been invented in memento ! i perfectly understand people who don not like it , but i would say that most of people won not be course , if you can bear a little suspense in the movie , don not watch . for all the others , this will be a great catch .
2			advice	best	it	amazing	information	new			like rolling thunder , it just keeps going and building . i listened to this as a book on tape . it was amazing how the plot was laid out quickly yet it kept moving . you really wanted to know what was about to happen in the subplots and mr iles wove in and out of the subplots so quickly and smoothly that you never minded leaving a point as new information was revealed . hard to explain but the best advice is that you will not want to put this down . i know i ended up having to walk around the house with my walkman when i could not get a reason to drive around just to keep listening .
2			we	happy			base issues . in reading the reviews , i had some concerns about the installation of the base and how secure it would be in our 2003 toyota sequoia . our sequoia supports the latch system , and after reading the instructions found in the carrier , my husband was able to install the base securely in the backseat . it moves no more than .5 inch in either direction . the trick is , you have to push down on the back of the base , and pull the belt system tight . we also found the red elevator to be a deterence in keeping the base secure . so , we keep it retracted . i will admit that the instructions are tricky . there are too many sets of directions that are not consistent with each other . other than spending an hour figuring out how to install the base correctly , we are happy with this system .
2			one	best	chucky	best	it	good	friend	new	camp	military	fan	true			sorry jack chuckys back . chucky 3 is the best chucky ever made it is as good as the second , in this one andy barclay is played by justin whalin where andy is sent to military camp and chucky is there , at the camp chucky meets a new friend but andy tried to stop him . but i am a true chucky fan and i think this one is the best one ever made .
1			seem	boring			yuk ! perhaps if you were caught up in the time this movie portrays , then maybe you would enjoy it . for me it seem well boring to some degree .
2			sections	helpful	workout	informative			informative and productive workout . the information sections have been very helpful . with this dvd you get it all , challenging , but not killer aerobics , strength training and relaxing yoga . kathy does it again with a very thoughtful , fun , helpful workout . i would highly recommend it for anyone approaching or experiencing menopause .
1			video	poor	quality	poor	nature	true	release	identical	r	worth no	artifacts	numerous	it	worth			this is a bootleg dvd r poor quality video / audio . there is no mention in the description of this item that this is a dvd r , not a properly pressed dvd , and the quality of the video and audio is very poor . i agree that this version of 1984 with peter cushing and produced by the bbc in 1954 is the best ever produced , with stark performances and the most chilling portrayal of a totalitarian government i have seen . but this dvd is obviously a bootleg import , and for amazon to be selling it with no mention of its true nature is deceptive at be st there are numerous video artifacts pixellation in the video as well as innumerable specks , lines , and a constant flickering . this identical release has been duplicated on two other amazon products b 0025 ig 8 and b 002 eck 1 all of which are of the same poor quality . if you haven not seen this version , it's worth going to youtube and watching there , but this dvd r is not worth what they are asking .
2			developments	recent	perspective	historical			a hidden treasure . heisenberg , the man who removed absolute destiny from science and replaced it with chance , eloquently attempts to unify the philosophies of kant , descartes , and einstein with science in regards to the recent developments of quantum theory . from a historical and internal perspective , heisenberg speaks directly to the the reader without the intellectual ego that often accompanies a man of his renowned stature .
1			singing	ok			moulin rouge . it was basically a musical , and they broke out in song every 2 minutes . the way that they made everything fast and unreal just made it kind of creepy . the singing was ok but the story wasn not all that great because they told us what was going to happen at the end , in the beginning .
1			it	pathetic	it	horrible	film	worst	life	entire	offense	little	chicagoan	native			rotten ! if you haven not seen this movie yet , rent it or something i beg of you , do not buy this ! it was the worst film i have seen in my entire life , the only saving grace was that it was hilariously horrible . it's pathetic that it was filmed in canada to be passed off as chicago and in one scene , one of the characters praises the beautiful , fine day in chicago that they are enjoying , but curiously , there's only land and powerlines as far as the eye can see not chicago like at all . as a native chicagoan , i take a little offense .
2			it	short	dialouge	good	it	good	inteloreance	religious	storyline	good	it	bad	acting	great			well , for me it was very good . i have heard people , and critics who say that this film it's bad , well i don not think so , the acting was great , the storyline was good , the dialouge was good , and , well here is my report card for the film acting plot 1 2 entertainment value 1 2 story and character development 1 2 smartness originality 1 2 kay , the only flaw for me was the plot , it was just way too short ! and i don not care about cliches , but in here there were just fun , well here goes a message to those guys , who say that is bad , about the theory of cydonia , and the origin of life on earth you just have no imagination and such religious inteloreance .
2			value	good			very good value . well thought out load bearing ve st fits well even for folks over 6 t tall and +220 lbs . with proper adjustment . ample room for rifle as well as pistol magazines . great set up for an ar 15 m 1911 1 or ak 47 m 92 s combo .
2			amount	limited	y	real			great on why it will happen ; weak on what to do about it . this is the perfect book to buy for your wife or mother in law if they think you are a kook . and , it's the perfect book for you to buy if you aren not sure if y 2 is real . but , the book has a very limited amount of information regarding what to do about the problem . the focus is primarily on why the y 2 thing will happen and what conditions will result from it . if you or anyone needs to know if y 2 is real , then buy this book !
2			perspective	new	bit	little	speaker	native			excellent book ! incredibly easy and direct way to give a new perspective into a 1 , 2 and 3 space ! flatland is written in 1800 s english , so it might be a little bit tricky to get it straight , if you aren not a native english speaker . sphereland is straight forward ! highly recommended !
1			thought	useful			save your money and do it yourself . although the thought that went into creating this item was useful , the item itself is not . the headings for content areas are there , but the learning curve is steep it was for me , and for my nursing students . there is not adequate space to allow for text entry , and it basically makes your paper pretty by adding took my students longer to figure out how to use the program than it did for them to create their own concept maps using a standard word processing program .
1			album	vocal	songs	good	i	little	disappointment	total			zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz . i have always loved bjork . loved her in the sugarcubes and i have followed her solo career buying every album or remix i could get my hands on . when i heard that she was making an experimental vocal album i was a little thrown off but had faith in her 100 . upon finally hearing the long awaited medulla i was met with total disappointment . 2 good songs oceania and who is it then you are stuck with a bunch of filler . does experimental have to be this painfully boring and uninspired ? king crimson , squarepusher , anodyne , doves , have all experimented . the only difference is that they don not put you to sleep like medulla manages to do . i m a lover of art but this is a self serving album . it certainly out the strings and the drum machine pleasestart making decent albums again like post or homogenicdisappointment of the year
1			mistakes	stupid			transcend 8 gb sd card . i ordered an 8 b card but recieved in the mail a 4 b card since i needed it right away i opened it and used iti really wish i had recieved this item correctly the first time and am very tired of the shippers making these stupid mistakes and i will not give them the opportunity to make it bettermaybe they can get it right the first time
2			hits	major	collections	best	collaboration	great	collaborations	new	woman	natural	songs	good			a great collaboration . this cd is has one of the best collections of music . the cd has the major hits from all the divas and some new collaborations . like chain of fools and the reason . all the songs are really good . my favorite was you make feel like a natural woman .
2			subjects	difficult	review	outstanding	job	great			outstanding , fun review of math and science . gamow does a great job of teaching all the subjects that were so difficult to learn in school .
2			one	enjoyable	track	weak	i	disappointed no			excellent album . i first heard of some by seas when i read on this album is rated as among the top ten albums in 2006 i listened to a few sample tracks and i instantly fell in love with the music . so i bought this album . i was not disappointed . there is no single weak track in this album . of all the 13 tracks , every one is thoroughly enjoyable . i would certainly rate it among my top ten 2006 albums as well .
2			i	pleased	room	small	price	good	humidifier	great	it	easy			great humidifier at a good price . i am living in fairbanks , ak for the first time and realized i desperately needed a humidifier . i bought this one because i wanted something fun to look at that was cheap and got the job done . it arrived promptly which i was totally not expecting , but thrilled nonetheless and i have been using it ever since . i would recommend using it in a small room , it works well in my bedroom . i turn it on at night and i don not wake up with sore throats anymore , and my skin isn not dry at all . it's really easy to use and to clean . the unit is relatively quiet , there is a low hum and noises like dripping water which doesn not bother me because i like having some white noise to fall asleep to , however it may bother some people . i have been really pleased with this purchase .
1			bit	concerned	success	previous	fans	tired	books	previous	information	new	installment	next			written for commmercial purposes ? having read all the previous books of the mitford series , i was eagerly anticipating the arrival of the latest installment . when i learned it was to be a prequel telling the story of the wedding , i became a bit concerned . after reading the wedding story , i must say that i consider my concern justified . i found the book boring , disappointing , and frustrating . there was no new information , no mystery , no conflict . it was obviously written quickly and did not require much creativity . i can only conclude that ms karon wrote it to capitalize on the previous success of the series this is , to make money and to appease fans who were tired of waiting for the next installment . i , for one , am far from appeased . this book did nothing to further the mitford series or , in my opinion , ms karon's reputation .
1			gun	good	gun	terrible	fps	slow	accuracy	terrible			not a very good gun , but ok for beginners . this was the first airsoft gun i ever bought , so i didn not know much about airsoft then . looking at this gun now , i see it is a terrible gun . when i shoot it , it only goes about 20 -30 feet , it's fps is about 50 very slow , it only hold 40 rounds , and it has terrible accuracy . if you are looking for a gun for a beginner , this may be for you . but if not , stay away from this gun .
1			music	real	song	worst	she	dumb	park	crappy	evanescene	crappy			who really listen to this ? 2304 reviews ? this band is a joke ! my immortal is the worst song of all time . amy lee can sing ? ? who said that ? fred durst ? look at this cd cover , her face is telling everyone she's dumb and she can not some real music . don not listen to this crappy evanescene or crappy linkin park .
1			effects	special			world of the warts . thirty minutes into this state of the art special effects extravaganza , i was begging mama to make the hurt go away so we could watch eraserhead again .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the bridges at toko ri . the dvd ordered the bridges at toko ri would not play in region 1 it would only play in region 2 another country . i had to pay for the shipping both ways when sending it back . i would have liked for them to send me one that would play in region 1 but they would not . have no idea where to order this dvd from . timothy orn
1			you	interested			smagol ? so i have actually been listening to this as a podcast , which i am entirely grateful for , because truthfully it's just not a story worth paying for . if you are interested , check it out at the library . whatever you do don not buy the audiobook ! the reader is the same in both the audiobook and the podcast , and while she does well coming across as a an empty headed teen girl , she sounds like smagol from lord of the rings when she's attempting male voices .
2			opener	old	reviewers	previous	i	glad			clicker good , instructions bad . i have an old sears craftsman garage door opener . i was skeptical that the clicker would work with my prehistoric opener . at first it didn not . the included instructions didn not work at all . i had almost given up when i googled the clicker and found the company's website . the instructions on their site made more sense and it worked like a charm . so don not give up on it , just find the right directions . i agree with some of the previous reviewers when they mention the size of the remote . it is a little bulky and the clip doesn not fit very well on my honda accord visor . other than that i m really glad i gambled on it !
2			tv	great			great tv show . watched this show serie back in the past and wish they could bring this show back we need fun show like this again
2			ones	new	music	old	memories	great			just revisiting my old music . i purchased this to replace my scratched up record i purchased back when i was 14 quite a while ago . enjoying the music and great memories ; creating new ones with my kids !
1			review	easy	whisper	good			pumps good if you tolerate the noise ! this review is easy to write pumps bubbles good whisper is misleading , because these pumps are very buzzy , noisy . i have 3 27 gallon aquariums and 3 whisper pumps . they are all the same , with the same noise problem . i am thinking of finding something less noisy and tossing these in the advice to the consumer is not to buy whisper to try one out in the store guess why they won not let you ?
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			avoid buying this product ! i read the user review somewhere else and i ignored them . what a fool i am . this product did not pick up any signal from my tv or radio . avoid buying this product . i had it return within 3 days of trying . trust me . do not buy this product sennheiser r 40 .
2			price	reasonable	dvd	new			review of showgirls . this product arrived on or before the advertised time . it was in excellent condition and had no scratchs or skip as are found in many pre played dvds . the price was reasonable and it makes an excellent addition to my dvd collection . i couldn not tell the difference between this copy and any new dvd i have purchased .
1			music	disappointing	number	disappointing	i	interested	songs	nice	book	great			diappointing . the music book is great , with a number of nice songs and well written the accompaning music , on the other hand , was quite disappointing ; based on the songs i selection i was most interested in was they call the wind mariah . this music was horrid ! basically the pianist , who could hardly wait to get this peice over judging by the tempo , pounded this rather monotonous tune out in a rather laboureous fashion . true , the music was written that way , but still it was poorly done overall and just useless . the impossible dream was only somewhat better and still played way to so far not so impressed .
2			wheel	big	seems	sturdy	product	big	product	real	bike	regular			fun , exciting toy . my nephew asked for a big wheel because he was having difficulties riding the regular bike i bought him . he's quit small for a 4 yr old . he loves it . although much of this product is plastic it seems very sturdy and has held up to his daily use very well . it seems better built than the real big wheel product that i saw at toys r us . i would buy this again
1			information	excellent	march	terrible	way	acceptable	person	average	book	good			could have been a good book . the information in this book could have been excellent if it were not shadowed by the terrible gram march i was unable to finish reading the book because of the errors . i find it a shame that this book is for sale and that some of the readers may assume the misuse of the english language is an acceptable way to write . i am an average person and i would have paid someone to proofread my book if i were to have it published , as i too make grammatical errors . with some more work this would be an excellent account of storm king mountain .
1			it	terrible	points	major	ex	concerned	way	hard	she	ok	i	bored	acting	cool			blah . i tried to watch this movie several times because i like ashton kutcher . i tend to like him in comedies with a larger point guess who or dramas with major points the butterfly effect , but if i could watch punk would , then i should be able to watch this movie . however , i was bored with this one . i m not a fan of brittany murphy . she was ok in 8 mile but i thought she was trying way too hard to be cutesy and sexy . it never seemed to come natural . her acting is cool . she does the vulnerable scenes well , but it's everything else that didn not convince me . i did like ashton's character . but the guy who kept following them around on their honeymoon just seemed to be more of a stalker than a concerned and still in love ex . i fell asleep through this movie several times before i barely got to the end . can not say i recommend it but i wouldn not say it's terrible either .
1			boy	poor	human	fresh	hungarian	exotic	silliness	enjoyable	saving	small			uniquely silly forties horror . the only thing that saves this effort from a one star rating is its enjoyable silliness , which is pretty extreme even for poverty row forties horror flicks . this time , bela lugosi is dr brewster yet another anglo saxon name for the exotic hungarian ! whose unholy experiments with apes have given him a face encircling beard , a slouching gait , and a tendency to sleep in a cage with his pet gorilla . he needs fresh spinal fluid human only , please to restore him to normal , so many complications ensue . his only ally is his sympathetic sister minerva urecal , who addresses him as you poor boy ! lugosi was about 60 at the time . the film was aparently not even intended to be taken seriously , which is its one small saving grace . even lugosi is not as charismatic as usual .
2			lite	great	product	good			lite on is great ! lite on responded quickly and sent my sling quickly . it is a sturdy well sewn sling . the color / print looks even better in person . i need to reread instructions as my baby grows to fully use the sling , but it is a good product .
1			sound	classic	it	hard			regressive metal . this album could have been done by any of the other metal bands that were around at the same time . tthe first song tailgunner is the only gem , the rest of the album doesn not have the classic maiden sound , with the time changes , and guitar solos that turn into full band instrumentals . it's hard to imagine it being the same band that did powerslave , piece of mind , or number of the bea st just my opinion .
1			place	wrong			rapid review micro and immuno 3 d . this is a must have for anyone preparing for the usmle , or just for revision for self study . somehow , the amzon kindle version has all the tables in the wrong place . this oversight by the publisher earns this book a single star in my review .
2			skill	great	book	good			superstitious r . l . stine , gossebumps , fear street . my favorite book , indeed . r . l . stine sure did it . he created a story with great skill and tons of suspense . it will keep you guessing . the book was so good , i couldn not put it down . it was practically glued to my hands ! you would never expect r . l . stine to write such a magnificent book .
2			you	pleased			very entertaining in 3 . this was my very first 3 movie , i have never seen a 3 movie even at the movies , and now that i know i can get even a better experence in my living room why bother with the expence of going to the movies . i m sure you will be pleased as i was .
2			credits	black			regarding the video on demand . very disappointed to sit through the film , have my son wonder out loud will he do the airstrike ? ? and then , after kurtz talks about the horror and sheen finishes up . . black credits ; only the chance to buy more at amazon .
1			films	available	version	original			original , please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we need a release of the original version starring sidney poiter and dorothy dandridge , just to name a few . ms dandridge's biography will air later this year and it is a shame that we cannot see the original version in which she starred . i believe that all african american films should be available . geez , there are enough of us asking for it , why not release it ?
1			girl	good	it	cool			pop drag queen goes solo . drag queen ? cause he lip synchs . michael jackson should get credit for like i love ya he copies everything about him post 1984 in fact it would be cool to hear mj do a cover of it . i wanted to throw up when i saw him perform the first cut from the album at the mtv vma's . but i have too admit that the line you are a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya . is kind of catchy . enough so that i was singing it to my cat this evening . it's probably a subtle jab at britney . like christina aguilera he hires rappers on the album that aren not very smooth or articulate in any sense of the wo rd my reccomendation is to spend the 4.99 on the single if you must but the album itself is not going to get worn out from playing it a thousand times , like with off the wall of thriller if you know what i mean .
2			weight	current			works . the product does help to control the appetite temporarily . works well in a slow weight loss program or to maintain your current weight
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			almost very good . compact , good for packing in lap top case . good for enhancing the sound of a triple aaa battery's , battery's cost too much money . has mini plug to connect to a device , and a power supply that is too bulky to pack with a lap topthis unit needs to be powered by a usb cable or double aa battery's , or you listening ? jbl
2			life	contemporary	script	theatrical	gem	little	gem	superb			chac the rain god . this is a superb little gem of a film was shot in chiapus mexico in 1974 in the area around san cristobal de las casas . with one or two exceptions , the actors are all residents of the village where most of the filming took place . it is an area of stunning beauty . chac was an early example of a film style that combines a theatrical script with a documentary approach . chac contrasts the ancient mythology drawn from the popul vu with contemporary village life of the maya . it is a film for adult viewers . this is a film you will likely want to share with friends which may lead as it has with me to the purchase of multiple copies ; gifts from my lending library !
1			idea	good no			just blended into a brown mess . all the tips on these have become one with the colors that were blended on them . not a good idea , don not waste your money !
1			it	easy	wheels	close	aesthetic	great			poorly designed . i wanted to like this product . after all , the aesthetic is great . unfortunately it is poorly designed , mainly for one reason the rear wheels are too close together and thus interfere with my daughter's feet when she's trying to , yes , i know that technically she's supposed to sit in the seat and scoot . however , kids will likely want to do both and they can not . it would have been easy to design this product for both uses . the rear axle could have been made as wide as the font axle . or better yet , include two rear axles in the packaging and let the parent choose which to employ .
1			location	new			breaks easily . when mounted at a tension that kept it firmly in the doorway , it put enough stress on the wood that it broke . we repaired it , and it broke in a new location . get this product instead it's prettier , made of sturdier and smoother bamboo , and it is reinforced in all of the places where this gate you have an irregularly shaped doorway , none of these gates work well , though , so keep that in mind .
1			dvd	helpful	it	repetitive			lot of time is wasted in describing the steps . me and my wife are both professionals . we bought this dvd for convenience over attending information provided in the dvd is helpful . however we found it is very repetitive , lot of time is wasted . the material could be easily covered in an hour at the most 75 mins . i would not recommend this dvd .
2			kids	poor	kids	little	dvd	educational	dvd	enjoyable	dvd	great	fun	little	dvd	worth	i	worried			great dvd , if you are not really strict . this dvd is enjoyable , educational , and well worth the money . it teaches manners please and thank you kind of stuff , but the baby puppet does dare to say no at times and needs a little fun and gentle encouragement to cooperate . if you are the type to be easily offended by a child telling an adult no now and then , this might not be for you . it could get your kid in trouble with you if he / she repeats some of giggles dialogue . i m a little worried that some poor little kids might even end up getting smacked around when they repeat in a giggles the puppet voice , what part of no don not you understand ? this series was designed by people trained in child development , who probably didn not take into account that there are still plenty of hitters out there , who would . er . um . discipline before they even stopped to think .
1			fan	big	book	great			kids will like it ! well , i m about half way through the book . i started reading it about 3 months i think it's a great book for let say a middle schooler . i m a big lotr fan so maybe i expected too much i don not know but to me it seems like it's a 15 year old's version of tolkien . although i think he probably did have some help rephrasing some sentences here and there . there are just some expressions in the book that i wouldn not expect from a kid his age . and that mixed together with the overall kids book feeling is just strange for me . i do agree with the reviewer before me though , it's an excellent work from a 15 year old !
1			heroes	literary	aspect	predictable	semblance	nice	righteousness	likeable	heroes	great			two and a half stars . in reading over the reviews posted here , it seems that people are very bothered by the shallow , materialistic protagoni st i didn not necessarily get that impression and besides , if every character was likeable and exuding righteousness , we would never have had some of the great literary heroes and heroines . that being said , andrea sachs doesn not fall into that category and the book itself was largely a disappointment . i had no expectation of lofty intellectual reading , but some semblance of plot would have been nice . every aspect of the story was completely predictable and the characters were rather poorly developed . i wouldn not go as far as to say that this was a waste of money , but i certainly wouldn not recommend it to anyone either .
1			movie	scary			not for 7 year olds . this movie was pretty scary , my daughter did not want to finish it , she is seven , and i agreed with her . i never felt the burning desire to know how it ended , so never watched it again .
2			he	right	it	easy			he's right but he fights a little dirty . i read this book in a couple of sittings and lost some sleep for that reason . it is thoroughly researched and written . miller makes a compelling case that george bush is semi literate , ill prepared for the office , lazy , and more than a little mean spirited . his thesis that tv & the media are largely responsible for the decline of the american politic is also convincing . i think , however , this would be a better book if miller wasn not so transparently hostile to bush and conservatives . granted , pres . bush is the easiest of rhetorical targets , but i think miller takes some cheap shots and stretches unnecessarily in his analysis of bush's language . as a result , it will be a little too easy for moderates and conservatives to dismiss this author . but , miller is to be commended for going beyond the usual catalog of bushisms to an attempt to understand what bush's famed inability to articulate reveals about the man .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the benchmark of all books on kent state . this book provides the most comprehensive compliation of facts and evidence , providing photographs and eyewitness accounts that lead to an unmistakable , inescapable conclusion the actions of the ohio national guard on may 4 1970 were completely unprovoked . unfortunately , those responsible for what could only be called a deliberate , criminal act were never prosecuted . after reading this , i strongly suggest you pick up the kent state coverup and read the rest of the story on how individuals within the ohio national guard literally got away with murder .
1			story	loose	shape	good			cat's cradle . i wanted to read some more of kurt vonnegut . i was disappounted with this book and never finished it . the book did arrive in good shape and on time . it semed like a loose story with some of his comments about life , but witout much of a plot .
1			actors	theatrical	seemed	plastic			the bbc series of the chronicles of narnai . i found this series to be quite disapointing . the bbc version seemed very plastic . the actors were too theatrical and their acting too over the top . characters like reepicheep were played by dwarfs and the whole thing seemed too stiff . i wish someone would take hold of this wonderful series of books by c s lewis and make a decent go of it like harry potter .

2			advantage	major	it	comfortable	quality	clear	good	comfortable no			pretty nice , and better than the others . i bought this earbud as an upgrade to the earbud which came with my at&t , nokia 8260 i also bought the jabra earbud to compare both . this earbud works quite well . compared to the jabra the sound quality going into as well as coming out of this earbud is a little less clear . however , the major advantage of this earbud is that it doesn not pick up as much annoying wind noise or any of that rustling clothes noise . this earbud is sensitive enough but , not to sensitive to be obnoxious . i kept this earbud it works well enough and is comfortable enough . the other though it comes with an assortment of ear gels , is just to complicated and surprisingly uncomfortable for it own good .

1			lyric	japanese	combination	rich	subtlety	powerful	imagery	natural			three lines do not always equal haiku . haiku is a japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form 17 syllables in three lines of 5 7 5 syllables . strictly speaking , a haiku must contain a season word and restrict itself to condensed , defined , natural imagery . those are the outward rules , and they are rules which can be and are broken . it is in the inward force of a rich combination of taoism , buddhism and shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace . the haiku year , while an interesting experiment , is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there . aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by r . h . blyth , the haiku anthology of english language haiku by cor van den heuvel , and the indispensable and well respected the haiku handbook by william higginson .
1			autobiography	creative	fact	historical	scholarship	recent	relationships	sexual	man	old	religion	new			hogwash . we know now what we didn not back in the 60 and 70 this autobiography is more creative writing than historical fact , and it wasn not written by jung but by one of the many disciples assigned the task of creating a mystique of sainthood around a deeply troubled carefully crafted presence of wise old man jung is artful , a mix of hero worship , hagiography , and new age religion . more recent scholarship paints a different picture a monumental temper often violent , directed against clients ; sexual relationships with psychiatric inpatients ; bizarre family relationships . the motto don not believe everything you read from the autobiography shelf , and don not get conned into this pseudo psychology .

1			attributes	positive	people	literary	i	quick	he	quick	works	major			why did strathern write this book ? i have observed that there are roughly two groups of literary people those who appreciate dostoevsky's works and those who don not . the author of this book sits firmly in the latter group , which begs the question , why did he write this ? he is quick to point out the faults of dostoevsky's major works , but then trips over his words and arguments in meager attempts to describe the positive attributes . indeed , if i were to base my opinion of fyodor mikhailovich and his works solely on this book , i would be quick to label him a neurotic right wing nut job who couldn not write his way out of a paperbag . in short , if you are looking for a book that will help you better understand dostoevsky and his works , this isn not it .

1			score	final	world	real			useful for a college class but not so for real world . if you are looking for help on launching a business this is not the book . in this book , the author provides 6 pages in the subject of helping you find the right idea . the rest of the book is just a scorecard of 44 criteria which you should consider ; he then explains one by one and assigns weights to each one to arrive to a final score . so you bring the idea and the author tell you criterias to consider and you add up the score and that's it .

1			account	historical	reviews	unique no			one of the most confusing tranquilizers i ever took . i began this book in quest of an accurate historical account . perhaps i was looking for something this author never intended to provide . i found it to be thoroughly confusing and tedious . just about the time i thought i was beginning to understand what i had read , i found out that i was farther off base than ever ! i have read reviews that indicate failure to complete is not unique to me . i made it to 40 . perhaps upon completing other works i will return and see if this one makes more sense .

2			daughter	old	trails	happy	side	personal	generation	next			never forgotten american icon . my 10 year old daughter had to do a biographical book report for her fourth grade class . i suggested roy rogers / dale evans . heros of my youth . i use to sing to her happy trails to get her to go to sleep as a baby . the biography also matched her interest in horses and dogs . she was hooked within the first chapter . she not only enjoyed the book , but she was able to convey information about the western duo that i didn not know their personal side . and who would have guessed that gabby hayes roy's sidekick was a shakespearean actor who taught roy how to act . this book offered my daughter life stories , including follow one's dreams , hard work to achieve goals , family commitment , giving back , love for animals , loyalty , and yes , some life tragedies and rebounding from them . it sounds outdated from today's priorities , but lessons that deserve revisited for the next generation .

2			peoples	native	it	interesting	alaska	modern	society	contemporary	subject	broad	topic	rich	writers	best	combination	great	books	best			one of the best books from one of america's best writers . john mcphee , it's often noted , can write about anythying and make it interesting , so when he tackles a subject as broad and fascinating as alaska you know you are in for a book is divided into three parts ; it begins in modern urban alaska , with the story of its history and contemporary society . from mcphee takes you to the remote villages and towns , a place still populated by native peoples and rugged outdoorsmen and women . the last chapter concerns alaska's last frontier the remote north slope , and the men who drill for oil all mcphee books , the author seems to fade into the background and let the people and the land tell the story for him . sometimes the reader feels as if or she , and not mcphee , is standing there on an oil rig . alaska is a rich topic , and mcphee is a wonderful writer . a great combination .
2			i	glad	shipping	free	i	satisfied	it	great	price	great	computer	great			great computer , great price . you need to try this computer , it's great . this is my 2 d apple , and i am very satisfied . i had a 15 inch apple , but bought this one , because it's size is more ideal for traveling . i m glad i bought it at amazon , for their fast free shipping , and with the rebate , this is the place to buy the 12 inch apple ibook .
2			machines	commercial	models	real	one	right	machine	old	models	professional			why did i wait so long . aah a taste of heaven ! i had a 40 yr old kitchen aid 150 watt machine that i literally burned up babied it for years and finally gave in and took the plunge . figured i could get lots of watts for not a lot difference in price was glad for the measurements so i didn not overdo it by going to the real professional models this one is just right for home use but has the features of commercial machines . nice !
1			reputation	contemporary	document	historical			already forgotten . this book was selected by ny times as a notable book of the year . the ny times , indeed , knew what's up . more than any other , born to rebel belonged to the year in which it was published ; it didn not take long at all for it to be forgotten as soon as the next year arrived it became a historical document . a classic ? stunning ? masterful ? why is its reputation in rapid decline ? sulloway writes books which don not even pass the 2 year te st surely this is a perfect example of how vulnerable contemporary reputation is .
2			help	little	tools	greatest	insects	small			the oed legacy . as a child i would take the magnifying glass fom my fathers oed to burn small insects , and start fires with a little help from the sun . my relationship with the oed has gradually progressed , and now is one of my greatest tools . i hope someday to pass the oed magnifying glass down to my children .
2			strides	great			a classic . i did not know that there are management books that make you think . it remains to be seen whether this or any book can actually make you change , but it certainly make great strides in encouraging to change your unproductive habits . it does not shine away from management paradoxes and that is one of its strength . at the end of the book there is a discussion of the distinction between a manager and a leader it helped me understand why romney lo st
1			folk	young			just terrible . bleek aint fittin to be the future of nothin wit this garbage . i expected something way better than this . it only got 1 star because of jay z's solo . my advice to bleek is to go get better producers , more tracks , and no more solos from jay if u want your shine . ya feel me . it young beezly folk !
2			ed	special			do you feel me ? i feel you ! how is this cd different from the first crank yankers cd ? this one features the theme song by fountains of wayne ! other than that , it is much the same as the first crank yankers cd . funny crank phone calls ! hilarious characters like hadassah guberman , niles standish , elmer higgins , spoonie luv and special ed ! if you are a fan of crank phone calls , you will dig this cd .
2			children	young			a must see for animal lovers . this truly is a movie that can be enjoyed by animal lovers of all ages . young children will enjoy the talking animals and their antics ; older children and adults will appreciate the sociological nuances in this well crafted fable .
1			plotthe	main	disappointment	major			really slow and boring , felt like watching grass grow . saw this series all the way up thru episode 28 hen i had to stop as i was totally boredproblem is with the script , lots of digressions unrelated to the main plotthe only redeeming quality is the costumethis 60 plus episode series could be presented much better in 20 episode max . major disappointment .
1			cover	new	gay	black	lovers	black	books	great	need	little			jungle fever meets the pink triangle . for its time , this book may have been revolutionary . however , when so many great books have been written by / on black gay men brother to brother , one more river to cross , vanishing rooms , etc , there is little need to read this book now . this book allows white men to speak more than blacks do . relatives of smith's black lovers say he exploited his mates . why did langston hughes estate allow his work to be published here but not spoken in isaac julien's looking for langston ? don not let the new cool cover fool you . there's better stuff out there , even interracial stuff .
1			fan	big no			don not bother . if you don not already believe the fundamentals of this book you aren not ready to quit . the continuous i am a nonsmoker was annoying . although admittedly , i m not a big fan of the cheerleader type self help books . i still can not fathom how this book ever got 5 stars based on quality and price . if you are committed to quiting talk to your doctor and join a group or try replacement therapy and skip this money waster .
2			sound	clear	look	good	colors	bright	acting	excellent	sound	crisp	features	extra			excellent action packed movie ! this movie look exceptionally good on blu ray . the colors are vivid and bright and the sound is crisp and clear . there are over 3 hours of extra features on the second disk . there is also a demo game for star trek on the third disk . the demo game was a waste of time not worth playing . acting was excellent and the story kept pace and didn not get boring . tyler perry was an admiral in this movie and he made me wanna puke but he only had about 5 minutes in the film so it wasn not too bad ; at least they didnt give him a starring role elese i wouldn not have bothered to buy the film . overall the director did an excellent job on the movie and i m waiting for star trek 2 hopefully tyler perry won not be in another star trek movie !
1			price	ridiculous			expensive . 38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull . especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store .
1			falsehood	complete	street	main	score	complete no	songs	best			buyer beware . buyer item is falsely advertised . it is actually selections from exile on main street and not the complete score . whomever made the 'selections is an idiot , in my opinion , as they left the best songs out . it's like buying a painting and sections of it are missing . it is beyond me why the integrity of a work of art like this album would be messed with in this manner and sold as complete . this product is a complete falsehood . do not buy this garbage !
2			deal	good	letters	big	designs	similar	languages	foreign	design	good	models	advanced	functions	basic			good deal of its kind . pros light weight . bright light . intuitive adjusting buttons . big letters . decent price about $ 19 after tax at sears , and about $ 20 including s / h at amazon marketplace . cons no multiple alarms that is , can not set the alarm to turn on every 6 hours , etc . more advanced models , such as casio db 37 d -1 v and db 37 d -7 v , have similar designs but more functions , such as data bank , weekdays in foreign languages , etc this model w 96 -1 v and its variant w 96 -1 v , however , offer only the standard basic functions for a digital watch . one thing that may bother people is the way the band is rigidly fixed to the case . the hinges cannot be turned . as a result , the watch cannot be laid flat on table . this feature does not bother me . but it may be something for other people to consider . all in all , this watch is a good deal for its decent price and good design .
2			book	original	movie	recent	simple	easy	it	enjoyable			war of the worlds . the original book was far better than the recent movie . it made for easy , simple reading , and was very enjoyable .
2			philadelphians	famous	recordings	fantastic	accoustics	great	feast	real	world	annual	home	new	feast	musical	recording	great			a real musical feast by the famous philadelphians . this cd is one among a handful of fantastic live recordings by the philadelphia one was recorded live 1993 at suntory hall tokyo , during their annual concert world great recording was conducted by one of their most well loved conductor's wolfgang sawallish pro nounced / suh vol music on this disc was well chosen , played & recorded with the great accoustics of the hall . mr sawallish also did a live recording with this orchestra in 2001 in their home verizon hall at the kimmel center for the performing arts he recorded schumman's 3 was the first live recording in their new home & the last recording mr sawallish made with the orchestra before he passed away . get this cd .
1			it	awesome	camera	great	life	awful			olympus zoom digital camera d 560 . that's great that everyone can talk about how great it is but the bottom line is that the battery life is awful ! that can not make for a great camera . i wish i would have read the reviews before i purchased it . however , target had no problem with the return and i purchased a canon powershot 3.2 megapixel camera for the same price and it is awesome ! ! do not buy the olympus unless you like changing batteries every time you use it ! !
1			version	current			check for latest version . you really need to own the latest version for it to work . i bought version 7 and it doesn not work for anything i have tried so far . when i checked the website i realized that the current version is 12 oops . now i will have to pay more money to upgrade .
2			cut	low	lift	good			my favorite . i love panache and i love this style . i have several of these . they give you that separation along with a good lift . i am a 34 in this one and this bra works wonders ! comfy and attractive . works well with low cut blouses .
2			board	nice	board	solid	looks	great			awesome deal . this is an amazing deal . for a wooden chess board with wooden pieces , this is an excellent price . although the wooden pieces arn not really heavy and don not have felt bottoms this is an excellent deal for $ 9 this fits perfectly on my desk and looks great . people are constantly telling me how nice it looks and amazed i would pay so much for it . the board is solid and very heavy very nice . enjoy !
2			it	heavy	it	big	it	practical	it	beautiful			really good . it's really big and heavy , but very beautiful and unique . cause it's size , it can not fit in the except that , it's very gorgeous and practical item for kichen .
1			intention	true			i have been vegucated . rather entertaining and informative during the beginning . the true intention of the movie , divide and conquer , soon reveals itself . it lost me at global warming and cattle burps .
2			book	informative	situation	serious			this book is well written and informative . this is not only funny to read but well written and informative . i can not wait to move my aging mother following the robbins / morse method . i hope these two are working on another project to print . they turn a sad and serious situation which seems impossible into a can do , workable and quite possible solution .
1			waste	total			mr coffee mug warmer . mr coffee mug warmer is a total waste of money . only keeps drinks lukewarm at be st not very satisfying at coffee mwblk mug warmer

1			i	disappointed	range	electric			hard to clean . i have used it a few times now . my food has burned because it gets stuck to the bottom , even with medium heat , and the rest of the food isn not cooked . i have an electric range which may be part of the problem , but i have never had trouble with any of my cuisinart pans . this was not worth the trouble of me and i m severly disappointed that with correct upkeep it looks like i have had it for years instead of 1 week .
2			price	good			5 stars for a 5 star artist . with only one evans cd in my collection waltz for debby . village vanguard 1961 i thought there was a long overdue need to rectify that situation . i discovered a couple of jazz 625 recordings on youtube with the same line up recorded a month after this one . that was a bit special and consequently i ordered a couple of his 50 s recordings and this one . despite bassist chuck israel's comment that we would done better , and the suggestion that bill didn not like the studio piano i don not feel that any of this comes across . this is a beautiful album which can still be found on amazon at a very good price . anyone not yet in to bill evans would not go wrong by using this trio recording as a starting point .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			yes another karunesh masterpiece ! i love karunesh music . i have taken the cds to massage therapy , i listen to them in my car , and i listen to them in the evening as i am going through my mail , eating my dinner , or working around the house . my dog and cat approve of my music selection as well .
1			detail	real	discussion	high	detail	poor	book	great			extremely disappointing . having read through the full table of contents before purchasing this book i thought i would found a great book . decent projects from design through to implementation with examples . however , what the book really turned out to be was some very high level discussion on the projects with very poor detail . there were no intelligent discussions on the designs or implementations . it lacks any real detail and the examples themselves are poorly done when compared to other c books i have read / use . its a book which will gather dust on the shelves for sure .
2			reads	enjoyable	memoir	great	it	hard			a great travel memoir . five stars . this book is one of the most enjoyable reads i have had in a long time . a travel memoir so vibrant and alive , it's hard to believe it was written fifty years ago , by a writer who was then in her twenties . so much fun to read impossible to put down .
1			people	numerous	moments	humorous	states	united	purpose	specific			if a movie could make you stupider . i had heard from a number of people that this movie was after having watched it , i cannot understand why people liked it . there were some humorous moments , but there's only about 1 or 2 of them . the movie gets rather old after about 15 mins . his information is fraught with misunderstandings , misinformation , and misdirections leading to an overall cornicopia of ignorance . he harasses numerous people including kmart and charleston heston in a sad attempt to be profound . he acts as if those people perpetrated the crime themselves and should be held responsible , when in actuality they had the most minor of roles to play if any at all . overall this movie definitely not a documentry lacks any direction or specific purpose and is just this man's atttempt to badmouth the united states with inaccurate information . if you are tempted to see it just for the hell of it , be everything that is said in this movie with a grain of salt .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			don not buy it . every time the dog barks , she gets sprayed . she barked so much my house smelled like citronella . get something that works . get a dog collar that shocks . this does not work at all . it just pisses her off more .
1			cd	new	singer	new	spectrum	good			not sure . . . whether this cd s cks or blows . i have all of this band's other cds , which demonstrate a good spectrum of style , but this new cd just isn not what i like . i know the godfrey brothers are the band , but without skye's vocals , they are just another band , and not one that i particularly care website says that now their new lead singer , daisy , has been replaced by someone else . better get it together guys , but in any event , i won not be buying any more morcheeba cds .
1			turd	complete	he	awful	christmas	hate	person	wrong	budget	low			low budget . the animation is not up to disney standards . belle beauty is poorly drawn and looks two dimensional . scenery is sparse . i don not even want to talk about the plot . alright , spoiler warning ! eisner / disney has the prince being a complete turd when he was younger and he was awful to the wrong person , who turned out to be a witch , who cursed him and turned him into a beast , on christmas . so the beast hates christmas . and there is a sinister evil pipe organ character who controls the beast through the beast's choice of movie for anybody . too dark for kids . not enough there for grownups . not visually worth looking at . skip it .
2			power	limited no	bibliography	worth	seciton	worth	helpful	solid			the actor's version of unlimited power . this book should be required reading for anyone thinking of making acting a career , not a hobby . the odds against a successful acting career are tantamount to an immoveable object , and they must be overcome with unstoppable force . this book will either spur you to succeed or save you thousands of dollars in wasted time and energy . some of its precepts are slightly controversial , but most of the material is solid , helpful and the quote seciton and bibliography is worth the price alone .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			funny . this was a hit at our office employee christmas party . this chicken was passed around a few times at the gift exchange .
2			bit	tiny			perfect ! i mix a dot of this shadow with a dot of urban decay shadow base has a tiny bit of shimmer . then tap , tap , tap it onto eyelids and blend it a bit . stays all day , no creasing , no crepe ! hard to find , but cream shadow is the be st add darker and / or lighter colors of powder shadow with a brush and you are set day into night ! removes with soap and water or stubborn !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			rusty and flaky ! i probably would have given this pot 5 stars when i first bought it a little over 2 years ago . i have had no trouble with the whistle or the cover , and i like the design . this pot ebameled metal has been used daily . after about 6 months i noticed some rust at the spout where the water comes out . this rust area has grown . now the inside is deteriorating . flakes of the inside coating are coming loose and it seems to be rusting a bit inside as well . i would suggest avoiding the colored versions and going for the stainless .
2			set	nice	it	great			pretty in pink . nice set of measuring cups and spoons . i have the same set in stainless steel . just a word of note , it does not come with the leveling tool . i wouldnt want this as my primary set , but it is great for the times where one set is just not enough ! i bake alot .
1			medicine	effective	medicine	traditional			a poorly written book . the author , a de licensed psychiatrist , wrote this book with no qualificatiosn whatsoever . he has no understanding or education in alternative medicine . the book is merely the rant of an uneducated dimwit . given the author's lake of qualifications , it is not surprising that the content lacks any evaluation of actual treatment . the fact that psychiatry and traditional medicine has been under fire for some time for its ineefectiveness is completely un addressed . the book's content is so malicious particularly in that it attempts to keep people who need effective altnerative medicine from getting it . if you really need to learn about altnerative medicince i wouldn not bother with this book .
1			waste	complete			waste of time . in my perspective this movie was a complete waste of my time and a complete waste of money for the producers . i wouldnt reccomend this at all . save yourself and dont buy
2			part	good	visions	bad			i like this book . the book castle in the attic is a good favorite part is when william defeated alastor . there was one other good part in castle in the attic . when william was trying to get to alastors kingdom and the dragon was distracting him with bad visions . i recommend this book to anybody who likes exciting books .
1			dvd	worth no	part	large	it	mixed	fan	big	list	good			disappointed . i was sorely disappointed with this dvd . this is in large part because of the sound and picture . this dvd doesn not just lack , but fails in both categories . the picture quality is really grainy and the sound is . well , terrible . it's poorly mixed and has static the plus side if you really like pearl jam the track list is really good . however , even with the awesome track list the dvd is not worth my money despite being a big pearl jam fan .
2			it	best no	books	good	it	interesting	army	modern	story	great	it	worth			fan of alternate endings and alike . this books was pretty good , it certainly filled the need i felt . some of the characters situations are a little boring and are not developed to well . but the story is great , when i read it i look at it like a modern day army fighting a wwii army . technology of the lizards is about what our technology is now , so that make's it interesting . it's not the best he could have made it but it is definitely worth reading , it can become addictive which is good , i recommend it .
2			way	great			god calling . great way to start your day ! it is a book you can read again year after year as you grow with the lo rd
2			dane	great	shakespeare	enjoyable	cinematography	stunning	movie	glorious	gibson	excellent	hamlet	easy	cast	superb			gibson's a great dane ! this is a hamlet that's easy on the eyes and the you don not have the time and stamina for branagh's 4 hour version , and can not get hold of olivier's exquisite 1948 film , this is the one for you ! mel gibson is excellent as hamlet . he gives him humor and a masculine vigor , and the top notch supporting cast is superb . i especially like alan lusty , murderous king is mention should be made of nathaniel parker's wonderful laertes . david watkin's cinematography is stunning , ennio morricone's score subtle and beautiful , and the production one of zeffirelli's be st this is very enjoyable shakespeare , even for those who normally don not like him , and i highly recommend this to parents who would like to introduce their teenagers to the ba rd don not miss this glorious movie !
1			effects	special	beauty	old	acting	horrible	stars	stars no			dario's darkest hour deserves zero stars . fans of suspiria , deep red , tenebrae , phenomena or any of dario argento's other accomplished horror films will be appalled by his inept retelling of the phantom of the opera . it goes to prove that a bulk of prolific directors from the 1970 and 80 such as john carpenter , tobe hooper , george romero somehow went astray when special effects began to consume movie is loaded with gaudy set design , underdeveloped characters , and gore scenes that surprise ! seem to rip off the late lucio fulci that is , the phantom bites off one victim's tongue and face in close up ! there is no atmosphere and no pulsing goblin music to set an ominous , spooky mood , so what does that make this phantom ? a load of junk that feels like a rerun of that old beauty and the beast tv show you know , with ron pearlman and linda hamilton , rife with horrible acting from julian sands naked lunch and the director's daughter .
1			coffee	hot			not happy . i find this cup warmer only keeps my coffee lukewarm at most even starting with hot coffee . i work at the computer and when i stop to reach for my cup , i want hot coffee , so it was definitely a disappointment .
2			cd	awesome			awesome . i thought the simple plan cd was awesome ! there is not one boring song and there are tracks that teens can really relate too . not to mention simple plan is extremely cute and sweet . best in pop punk that i have ever heard !
1			movie	bad	it	right	movie	suck	features	special	soldiers	suck	ending	suck	story	suck			lame and awful . it started out pretty good , but quickly went downhill . by the time it ended , this movie truly sucked . do not waste your time on this . if you rent it i will guarantee you will shut it off half way through . if you buy it , you will sit and suffer as you watch the whole thing through . i mean you bought it so you have to watch it right ? the story sucked , the soldiers sucked , and the ending really sucked . check out the special features . the alternative ending is a hoot . it's not an alternative ending , it's an alternative movie . they had no idea where the hell they were going with this . just a bad bad bad movie . terrible in every way .
2			issues	religious	novel	historical	ones	good	writers	good	footing	equal	they	good			well written historical novel . nineteenth and early twentieth century writers , if they were good , were usually quite good at description and establishing time and place . benson is one of the good ones . he writes of a time little visited in the imagination , the late 17 h century and describes england under charles ii . particularly , he describes the situation of catholics and their hope for equal footing with the ruling protestants . the politics , religious issues , the society are well portrayed . like most early 20 h century writers , benson's pace is slower than the novelists of today . with patience , the reader will be rewarded .
1			it	boring	book	worst			childrens homer . this is the worst book i have ever read ! ! ! never read it ! ! it is soooooo boring ! are english teacher made us read it ! don not read it !
1			claptrap	emotional			don not be seduced . this is mostly emotional claptrap . as my daughter put it , i don not want jesus to be my boyfriend ! women don not be seduced by this . your relationship with god and with others , as scripture demonstrates , is much bolder than this .

2			it	good	sign	good			umm . works awesome . i bought this gun for my brothers as a christmas gift not really expecting it to be that good or even arrive by christmas . but within a week the seller had it processed and shipped and they arried on christmas eve . and they work great too . i was shot in the leg from fifteen feet away and it hurt like hell . a good sign i m told . the battery life is pretty long lasting so you are not throwing your money away in that area and they haven not jammed yet .
2			evocative	visual	normalacy	typical	orleans	new			drowning at midnight . i enjoyed this . get to see n cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick . a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy . he starts off living in a nightmare , and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat . it all takes place in new orleans , a city where dissipation is a career . during the lowest part of cage's crash dive , herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas . disconcerting , but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment . this film is a mesmerizing ride to hell , with cage as the perfect conductor . there is a light at the end of all this , preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer .
2			information	useful	index	limited	book	good			very good book for your first and foremost tuning book . easy to read , concise , useful information . except for some typos which are rather blatant when they occur and a limited index in this age of word processor generated indexes , no less this book would deserve 5 stars . will quickly bring up an intermediate programmer up to speed so that not only will his / her code will run well !
1			way	easy	carb	low	table	limited	things	important	anecdotes	memorable			there are better books out there . my girlfriend and i switched to low carb diets / lifestyle a few months back and bought a few books to educate ourselves , this was one of them . i honestly did not enjoy this book very much . the author explains many of the important things regarding a low carb lifestyle , but not that well and in a rather bland way . also the glycemic load table in the book was pretty limited and riddled with product plugs for some obscure you are looking to learn about low carb diets i would highly recommend , living low carb by jonny bowden . he does a much better job of thoroughly explaining what you need to know in an easy to understand way and is sprinkled with humor and memorable anecdotes .

1			child	careful	intro	great	it	easy	one	new			waste of money . we bought this mix stick for our daughter for an 8 h birthday gift . we thought it a great intro to the world of mp 3 players . it is easy enough to use , just plug into your computer and load songs on it . it works like a flash drive . but , 6 months later it stopped working , for no reason . this child is very careful with her things and it truly just stopped . i tried to solve the problem myself , but there is no online support for this thing . just some useless faqs . i called memorex customer service and was told the warranty was 45 days and to replace was $ 38 of course i could get her a new one for about $ 5 more . this is not worth the money for only 45 days of guranteed service . spend $ 30 more and get an ipod shuffle . more storage space , cute colors and way better warranty and online support .
1			feelings	negative	anything	new	band	industrial			boredself . i guess i am the only one who have negative feelings about the album . i too have waited for 7 years and nakedself isn not the album i had been expecting . matt johnsonn is of course a genius , but this album doesn not add anything new to his genius . the lyrics are so happened to the man who wrote infected and mind bomb ? salt water , voidy numbness don not feel like the the , they just feel like any other industrial rock band . i believe that mind bomb was the peak moment of this genius . apart from other albums , this album can be regarded as pretty good . but if it weren not the the , i wouldn not buy it . i wouldn not even download it for free . i don not know if i am being too rude here , but as a person who have been listening to the the more than 10 years , i can say nakedself can be forgotten for another 7 years . don not mention hanky panky . i won not say a single thing about it .
2			i	surprised			comes with spices , but smaller than it looks in the picture . this is a really cute spice rack and very handy since it comes with the all the spices ! however , i was surprised that it was much smaller than i had expected . be sure to look at the measurements before you buy it .
1			opening	original	city	major	interest	particular	i	surprised	reviews	good	film	painful			a study in narcissism , not schizophrenia or family relationships . i m pretty surprised at the amount of good reviews this film has gotten on amazon in comparison , the reviews on netflix are , i think , much more realistic . i think people who have never been exposed to someone like jonathan caouette might find this film original and eye opening , but the fact is that trashy gay male art students from dysfunctional , abusive or drug addled families are a dime a dozen , and the streets of any major city in america are teeming with them . this film was painful to watch i was cringing with embarrassment for jonathan and his family through most of the scenes and found myself watching the film for the train wreck qualities of it , and not because i felt any particular interest in the story of how jonathan coped with his situation .
2			you	curious	house	mysterious	speech	difficult			and then there were none . and then there were none was a novel anbout a group of 10 people who are all invited to a mysterious house on indian island . all these people have one thing in common , and that is that they have all committed a crime . some of the crimes were accidental but some of them were unintentional . mysteriously the people staying in the house start dying one by one . the deaths appear to be accidenta but are they ? this mystery is well written and keeps you curious the whole book . the speech of the charaters may be a little difficult to understand for some people , but otherwise and then there were none was a suspenseful and exciting novel .
2			period	historical	stuff	great			if you liked this book . horatio is great stuff , and if you liked this , you will also like patrick o brien's 19 book series , which covers the same historical period . the first book is master and commander , the second is i think , post captain . beautifully written .
1			quality	poor	bed	new	one	bad	one	new	i	gentle			poor quality . i wanted to get a mattress cover for a brand new bed i just purchased . i tried this product and it ripped almost immediately while attempting to put it on . i figured i must have simply been unlucky and gotten a bad one , so i exchanged it for a new one and the same thing happened . keep in mind i was being gentle with it , and not pulling and tugging on it . it is just a very flimsy cover .
2			it	easy	demon	great	converter	serial			a great speed demon . this will greatly increase the speed of tranfer , from your i paq to your desktop pc . just imagien tranfering the averge files in around eight seconds . when partnered with the ac adapter this couple are cheaper than the cradle and making it easy to bring on road trips . the i paq is the only handheld to be supported by macs and the usb cable destroys the need to buy and use a serial cable converter .
1			acting	bad	cast	adequate	show	terrible	quality	good			a silly , cheap program with bad acting and plots ! a silly cheap program with bad acting and plots ! this is the type of cheap program that wb continues to put out . reba mcentire is no comedienne , much less an actress . the supporting cast is barely adequate but overshadowed by reba's trying to outshine everyone the way she usually does . this dvd which i did not buy , but rented from the video star is good quality meriting one star but the show really is quite terrible ! i m sick of these country stars thinking they can go hollywood and take over . mcentire is appalling !
1			bag	clear	shimmery	big			not what it seems ! these are sold as captain america gloves , but really they are just shinny red child gloves that are probably meant for any costume as the package was a clear plastic bag with no mention of any superheros . it could just as easily be for a girl and probably more so since they are a big shinny / shimmery . also , if you are planning on buying for the captain america costume it is a totally different are actually plain red child gloves that could be for any outfit .
1			people	hard			hallmark entertainment needs to join us in the 21 t century . it is extremely sad that hallmark entertainment has not realized that hard of hearing and deaf people need closed captioning to understand the product they are marketing . if they have realized this , then they obviously could care less about disabled people of any kind .

1			user	average	audio	due	pair	bad	reviews	positive	set	defective	spectrum	entire	end	high	ear	critical			sony blew it with the mdr line . this is the second set of headphones i have tried in the sony mdr line , as i previously tried their 970 k model and sent them back for a refund due to distorted audio . thinking i just got a bad pair , i tried another set , the 925 k . same result . the audio is distorted across the entire frequency spectrum and has a hallow sound that i might be able to live with without the distortion . i doubt i got a second defective set , though it is possible . i think it more likely sony blew it with their mdr line . how these headphones got so many positive reviews i can only attribute to my experience with high end audio equipment and having a more critical ear . however , they are distorted so bad that even the average user should notice .

1			writing	atrocious	book	worst	option	negative	it	cool			a case for a negative stars option . this is the single worst book i have ever read in my life . it tries sooooo hard to be hip and cutting edge but the writing is atrocious , the 'story is duller than dishwater . one of those books people pretend to like because they think it's cool .
1			guitar	worst	duty	heavy			cheaply made ! from the time i received this and the time i boxed it back up was 5 minutes ! so poorly made , so easily tipped over not good for my gibson sg . not heavy duty as in the description . this is the worst guitar stand i have ever seen
1			story	true	man	terrible			a werid subconscience ride . the story is about a racist , who was involved in a murder , of two children , and disfiguring their father . he is being sentence to death via the gas chamber for this murder , that he only helped , but did not fully commit although he had committed many other crimes in the past as one writer said the first half of this book is about this terrible racist man who deserves to die . the second half on the book was about the same man , but he is now portrayed as a guy with a heart , and was truly sorry , and thru the true story you learn that he didn not wish for anyone to die , just a different kinda crime to be committed . i wasn not able to finish this book , because the plot became very predictable , and the facts about what happens when someone suffers at the hands of the chamber became too much for me .
1			fan	disappointed	read	good			disappointed michener fan . i have read and enjoyed nearly all james michener's books so when i found recesional at a flea market i thought i was in for yet another good read . i finished this book only because i felt compelled to say i read it through . the book is way below michener's usual attention to detail , has a sappy storyline , several blatant inaccuracies and a reference to a retard i found disturbing for an author of this caliber . definitely one for the recycle bin .
2			reader	individual			a second chance dance . this is an allegorical tale that provides food for thought , as the reader accompanies one man on his journey to redemption . the man is question is a deeply flawed one , driven by many of the seven sins . when he kills his girl friend and flees in his car , he has what would appear to be a fatal accident . instead , he mysteriously finds himself in the land of ata . thus , begins this fantastical utopian book is simply written and chronicles one man's entry into a world where the dream state is reality . it is a world where unconditional acceptance of others prevails , and symbolically all are spokes in the circular wheel of life . much of the book is redolent of christian ideals . how much of ata is in this man's mind and how much of it is truly real , i leave to the individual reader to discern . it is comforting to think , however , that the kin of ata just may be waiting for you .
2			stewart	awesome	movies	best	acting	great			one of the best movies ever ! this movie never fails to make me laugh and make me cry , no matter how many times i watch it . great acting ! jimmy stewart is awesome !
2			albums	personal	material	good	love	new			this album is all sex . this is the record to put on when you don not want to be distracted by the music , merely a close listening , it's simply one of the most honest , self exploring personal albums , especially from a female perspective . etta could make the phone book sound smoldering and sexy and here she takes some good material and makes it it in the background for a new love , or listen alone with a bottle and shot glass and let etta make it all is an american icon .

1			review	previous	product	weak	capsules	expensive	amount	tiny	oil	hot	oil	true			don not waste your money on this extremely weak product . that previous review can only have been written by a representative of the company . i purchased this product last week at whole foods . from the research i did , i knew that true oil of oregano is hot to the taste . so i bit into one of these oil of oregano capsules , with its thick gelatin lining , and the tiny amount of substance inside tasted entirely like olive oil . olive oil ! it had a slight taste of oregano , but certainly no more than your cooking after you put a dash of the spice into your food . so the lesson if you want expensive olive oil capsules , by all means buy these . but if you want oregano oil capsules , look elsewhere .
2			lens	new	protection	constant			perfect for the canon 10 -22 m . this hood is a perfect match for the canon 10 -22 lens . i know it should come with the lens , but get over it and just buy it . you need the hood to prevent flare , and more importantly , for constant protection for the front element of your new lens .
2			dvd	great	comedian	great	comedy	central			freaken awesome . i just won the dvd on patton is great . my frienss were laughing through the whole thing when it aired on comedy central . patton if you read this when you google yourself one day in the future know that your a great comedian and then do more get a better web site and never get a part like you did on king of queens cause that isn not you and your funnier than that . you rule !
2			writing	atrocious	office	small	additional	professional			most used software on my computer . i have been using pagis pro for over 5 years and find it to be user friendly for it's sophistication . at work i use the form filler portion for all forms that we do here at work . my hand writing is atrocious and typing in the blanks makes my forms neat and presentable . i scan all recipts and documents therefore saving file space in a small office . i run windows xp professional additional with no problems what so ever with pagis . i doubt there is a better progrsm out there to do what pagis does so easilyl
2			scholar	religious	periods	historical	groups	religious	periods	specific	theologian	great	one	impressed	compare	final	tool	great			a master teacher ! avery dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar , in an easy to follow , step by step sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by christians today . these models serve as a great eye opening tool in the final compare and contrast stage of his analysis . perhaps more fascinating , dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods , so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes , as one generation of christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past , and how meaningful dialogue with historians , scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian . one can not help but be impressed .
2			it	short	guy	depressed	it	easy	book	great			it's one my favorite books ! it's a great book . holden was this depressed guy with cynical thoughts on his head . it touched me . i couldn not put it down . it's easy to understand and you won not get bored of it . the only problem i see with this book is it's too short . i would have read it if it was the longest book ever written .

2			i	surprised	you	surprised	charlie	cool	quality	low	it	entertaining			don not expect too much and be surprised . the acting is over the top . there are no surprises to be had with the movie . i picked the winner of this game show before they entered the playing field and soon figured out who the traitor would be . still , it was very entertaining and different . i didn not expect much out of it , so i was pleasantly surprised . the quality is low , but it works in the context of this game show . and chainsaw charlie is pretty cool . if you don not expect too much , you should be pleasantly surprised .
1			seems	nice	glass	real	itself	nice	method	horrible			the item itself is nice , shipping method is horrible ! the lamp itself is nice , and the chimney itself is real glass . i can attest to that because it arrived in pieces . whomever packed the box used three plastic air pillows on one side of the box only . horrible ! thus the lamp was only protected from impact in one direction . it's a shame since the lamp itself seems nice . i see a number of complaints along the same lines , so maybe amazon should force some quality control on this company ?
2			game	great	history	rich	games	great no			don not be mislead . great game , mostly because of rush n attack . the other games are not so great . . even though they have a rich history
1			felt	good	ones	recent	way	nice	book	suck			start a different project . there is no nice way to say this . this book sucks . i have been a loyal john saul fan from his early books through the more recent ones . i usually find that it is his older novels that i like the mo st this book is definitely the exception . have you every read a book that you hated so much you felt good about skipping pages in it just for self preservation ? this was that book . the plot is non existent once you actually start reading the book . the premise sounded great and very interesting but the book just didn not live up to the potential it had . sad attempt .
1			prince	fresh			like dweebie or qwee wee . after completion of my synopsis upon this album . i have hypothesized that this fifth ward weebie has none of the qualities that other quality rappers have such as vanilla ice , fresh prince , marky mark , cowboy troy or bubba sparks . in essence weebie is to rap what corn is to poo . he puts the rap in craphole . he is further enhancing the downfall of society . do not support this fart face .
2			crime	current	novel	particular	character	major	story	interesting	twists	major	pair	good			facing rainie's past . i have come to appreciate the novels including rainie conner as a major character , and appreciate how this particular novel incorporates the secrets of her past as a part of both the solution to the current crime and in her ongoing friendship with fbi profiler pierce quincy . they make a good pair in creating a with all lisa gardner novels in my opinion , the characters are well drawn , the story is interesting , the solutions logical , and best of all the journey is filled with major twists and turns , and an intensity that keeps you from wanting to put it down . a very good read .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			don not try the com examples . i used this book to navigate around the windows internet api and managed to put together a decent desk top application in great . but the com examples are so full of errors that they can not be compiled from the source code provided from the publisher . now i m not a super com programmer but have put together com applications with some success . however , it seems the author slapped together the com chapter with little or no thought .
2			value	good	piece	flat	one	flat			good value . this replaced a flat one piece sock assi st i like the fingers they fit my foot better . good value . however , i would rather have the smooth side out i could do this with the flat one i had before . it was easier to slide the sock off on my foot with the terry cloth next to my foot and the smooth side next to the sock .
2			music	interested	album	great	music	great	combination	great	collection	best	cd	current			a review from a music fan in detroit michigan area . this is deffinitly a great album . one of the best in my current cd collection to date . the gathering uses a great combination of female harmony vocals and great music laong with it . this is the kind of music that can deffinitly get stuck in your head and you could go on sing ign it forever . i suggest it to anyone who enjoys music from the metal and rock genre aspeacially interested in female vocals . this lead singer can sing great .
1			i	bored	we	disappointed	it	great			departed . why was everybody so hyped about this movie ? my wife and i borrowed it from a neighbor who raved about it and we were both very disappointed . i was bored during most of the movie . i can not believe people thought it was so great . my mom bought it and has watched it 5 times . i could hardly sit through one viewing , wondering when it was going to end . over rated !
1			extender	wide	bra	current	bra	wide			wide bra extender too wide . beware the wide bra extender is very wide . measure your current bra before buying !
2			mind	open	guitar	powerful			unique enough for you . if you are considering this album , there is no doubt you have an eccentric taste in music . no silver / no gold definitely sticks to the baptist generals formula of ultra lo fi recordings with rambling vocals and a looping , powerful guitar . though stand outs or singles may prove difficult to get into , they exi st make sure you enjoy this album with a pair of headphones and an open mind .
1			altars	little	me	sick	family	functional	they	awful	family	happy			couldn not stomach it . i am not someone who only enjoys a book if it is about a functional and happy family ; i loved angela's ashes . but something about little altars made me a little sick . i didn not care about any of the characters because they were so awful . from the first page to the last , i found nothing compelling about this book , only characters who are smug about their skewed world . guess i won not be reading divine secrets .
2			looked	good	album	best	recommendation	highest	quote	direct	zealand	new	styles	musical	bands	best	i	worried			best album of the year . i m from baton rouge where lucinda williams learned how to play guitar direct quote from her amazing concert here last week . we were looking for something different to listen to while driving across new zealand and the reviews looked good . we happened to pick up the christchurch newspaper which picked it as the best album of the year as we drove over arthur's pass long way from louisiana and i couldn not agree more . the blend of musical styles works damn well . they played a concert here last week and i was worried that it would be one of those unplugged things that wouldn not work . not ! lucinda has put together on of the best bands i have ever seen . the album and the concert both have my highest recommendation .
1			i	amazed			heads up ringo . to me this disc is marred by macca's knack for opportunism . beatles greatest hits packaged in red white and blue . how timely . i am amazed at how petty paul is . reversing the song credits to mccartney / lennon is shameful . all you need is love sir paul . oh wait , that was john's . or was it ? i m sure if he recalls correctly , paul can take credit for writing george's something . the one apparent truth seems to be that the beatles are dying in order of coolness . heads up ringo !

2			numbers	real	alternative	good	book	good			good book . this is a good book on set theory and it is axiomatic set theoy . inductive sets , peano's axioms , real numbers , cardinals and ordinals are covered . the book is well organized , the proofs are rigorous , and the material is well motivated . goldrei is a very good alternative , especially for self study .

1			stars	professional no	binding	poor	process	bad			memoirs of a geisha . book binding is extremely poor on the original and the replacement book . pages look like they have been cut by a blind man who has had a whiskey or seven . manufacturing process is very bad and no body checks what they send out . in addition , if i could have left `no stars for the review i would have but amazon do not allow ` 0 stars , extremely unprofessional .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			superman needs restored soon . this film is an absolute classic . i have never in my life seen such a film which had an impact on me like this film . this is by no means a children's film , now as i am in my 20 i appreciate this film for what it was a piece of cinema genus . it is a shame that a lot of countries round the world did not see the 3 hr 8 min cut of the film that was shown in kcop in 1994
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			self help mother book . very educational . refreshing to read the other opinion of moms which is far closer to the truth than fraud ever was
1			film	superior	flashbacks	constant	organization	japanese			boring , lifeless and feeble . after the okay ish part 2 this sequel plunges the series into the depths of diminishing returns . plot , involves an evil japanese organization who are determined to take over the city with the help of some decidedly uninspiring robot ninjas . souless , tame , humdrum waste of time and money which seemingly relies on constant flashbacks to the first and far superior robocop film . if you haven not seen any robocop movies then see the first one instead of this . if , on the other hand , you have seen the first robocop film , then be content with that . you won not find anything worthwhile in this trash .
2			reviews	great	book	great			what can i say that hasn not already been said ? all the great reviews speak for themself ! it's a book written by oscar wilde , that alone ought to make you order right on the spot ! this book is great ! i love it ! and i love dorian gray ! get this book !
1			sound	horrible			does not work ! this item does not work at all . they tried to convince me to keep the product by saying that bugs were coming out of the wall due to the sound . nope . the product simply does not work ! plus , it creates this horrible high pitched sound that's supposed to be inaudible to humans . do not buy this product !
1			effects	great	story	horrible	dissapointment	huge	effects	special	seat	good	ending	crappy	me	wrong			all the hype for a huge dissapointment . i was sooo pumped about going to this movie . i waited in line for 2 hours to get a good seat . for what ! ! ! a crappy ending . the first matrix got my pulse pounding and made me thirsty for more , only to be utterly dissapointed in the end . dont get me wrong i liked the action and the great special effects , but the story was horrible . there was no closure to the film . the machines are still there so if they wanted they could enslave humanity again . all of the population is still plugged into the matrix . at the end i found myself saying what the hell ! ! ! ! why bother making a trilogy if you dont end the story . all that happened in the 3 d film is neo dies trinity dies and smith dies , and the machines leave the humans alone . see the movie for yourself but it is not worth the 9 dollars for a ticket .
1			i	disappointed	i	excited			ophelia speaks but has nothing to say . i was excited to read this book because i had read reviving ophelia and was looking forward to a different perspective on some of the same issues . i was disappointed . i wonder how these entries were selected and what the author's point was in selecting them .
2			library	spiritual			hardly leaves my side . i have had this book for over a year . it's one of my companion books that i pick up regularly throughout the week . it's truth and helpfulness are treasures to me . i would recommend it for anyones spiritual library .
1			movie	old	collector	special	notes	technical	movie	classic	transfer	good			the lost extras . this is dvd for disappointing , very disappointing . and sloppy , too . very sloppy . slingshot gives us a reasonably good transfer of a classic and lovely old monster movie , but the supposedly special collector's edition fails to deliver half of the extras advertised on the back of the dvd . there is no second audio track music only , no in depth essay by scott macqueen , no ray harryhausen letter , no technical notes , and no recreation with stills and script excerpts of missing scenes of the original 10 reel version . what a pity ! i m returning my copy and hoping that someone else releases it with the care and supplements that the movie deserves .
2			picture	black	effects	special	story	great	effects	good			better than evil dead ! creepier than night of the living dead ! the first and best of the movies from tales from the crypt ! ! about the movie is pure creepy suspensefull horror with a great interesting story ! ! very easy to understand , cool production , good special effects and pretty bloody gory with some nudity ! ! i think this movie is a mix of evil dead and night of the living dead , but this story is way much better than evil dead and of course with better acting , cast , quality and special effects . the suspense is very look alike to night of the living dead but of course the make up is better , no black and white picture and this time the zombies are ugly demons that are harder to kill . p . s the best of all is that the intro is the same as the tv series ! ! adios .
2			vocalists	great	e	high	end	high	player	good			very good . this is just a note in response to some of the other reviews . i love fates warning . however . .1 although jim matheos is a good guitar player , but he is no shred master by a long shot in the vein of yngwie , paul gilbert , etc . actually , imho , he's more gifted at songwriting than at playing blinding guitar solos . his solos fit the songs very well , but the word shred never comes to mind for me whatsoever .2 a reviewer also wrote that ray alder whose voice i love can easily hit notes higher than halford or tate . this reviewer must not be a singer ; all of the aforementioned singers peak out about where all other great metal vocalists do at the high end when executing those wails / screams approximately at or between the g and a notes that one would find on the 15 h 17 h fret of the high e string on a guitar .
1			software	terrible	return	simple			terrible tax software . only after double and triple checking every line could i be sure that my state return was accurate . i would have saved time by using pencil and paper . while the taxcut federal software i used was semi respectable , this is a disgrace ! many entries are not calculated automatically at least for the dc version , you have to calculate a value youself and enter in the box ! unless your return is very simple , i guarantee you will file an incorrect return if you trust this software blindly .
1			stuff	nasty			what about hexane ? martek labs supposedly processes the algae with the toxic , petro chemical based hexane . because no residue is left , they don not have to list it , but it's nasty stuff . read the cornucopia institute's report on soy and see the reference to algae based dha . i m trying to find other brands that don not use hexane .
2			job	fantastic	amount	huge	work	outstanding	candy	total	score	worth	day	modern			if you dont like the movie . watch it simply for the score . danny elfman does a fantastic job scoring this movie . he is by far my favorite movie composer . i have a huge amount of respect for if you don not like this movie , the score is more than worth sitting through this film that note , i would like to express my love for this movie as well as it's music . the animation is total eye candy . amazing . literally a modern day classic . tim burton is god . i love everything he makes . outstanding work .

2			organ	nice	kind	good	track	final	kick	solid			lexicon the lessons . sexy discotheque house from lexicon on their first album , the lessons . right away , funk corner gets you swaying to some sweet piano line grooves and some nice hammond organ punches , while superstar has a more solid kick drum . lots of dancefloor fodder here the good kind , too . the steady beat of phrunky gives way to a wiggly acid funk line ; the question and the ryker are much more percussively aggressive . but summer madness gets us back into the sunshine shining on the block party . placenta and kolt sivers is the smooth tech house that plastic city has become famous for . the final track , jazz field , moves into more downtempo territory ; these boys are more than one trick ponies . take these lessons home !
2			level	new	place	good	book	little	it	exceptional	projects	practical	concept	new no			inspiring little book . the author of this book , vivian peritts , has taken crafting to a new level . making things with the intention of giving them to the less fortunate is not a new concept but certainly there are no other books out there that focus on great , easy to do and practical projects . the poetry and inspirational verses and quotes round it all out to make it quite exceptional . individuals and groups alike of all ages will find it a good place to find ideas .
2			use	limited			no problems . no problems so far . the headphones have been working fine for my purposes . my use is limited .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			i 3 the giver . the giver is an amzing story that you will never forget ! it will keep you reading , and at the end , you will want to read it again ! i would suggest this book to anyone , guy or girl !
2			vinyl	high	it	great			vinyl is back ! it is great to have this newly reissued , high quality vinyl edition . it is sounding great on my radio show , outsight radio hours !
1			reaction	bad			strange reaction . i have taken quite a few different types of fat burners and have never had the bad reaction this stuff gave me . when i would take it , yes , it did all the stuff it said weight loss i dont know , but i wasnt hungry , had more energy , etc but my face and neck and hands would turn blotchy red and start burning and itching . when the effects of the pills wore off my skin would go back to normal . as horrible as this sounds i thought it was just something my body had to get used to so i continued taking it and it continued to have these crazy effects . would not use again .
2			release	original			these are the tracks that were not included in the original soundtrack release . if you were a tad sad that the original release of the movie soundtrack was incomplete , than turn the sad into glad with this cd . here are the tracks that were you loved the movie , you will adore the soundtracks !
2			money	creative			a fast , fun , informative read . i have always considered myself frugal and very wise in my spending . lisa wysocki's book opened my eyes to some very creative money saving tips that even i the queen of frugal had not thought of . she presents the information in a very funny and enertaining format .
2			album	great	broadway	original	broadway	great			original broadway cast and great . brings back warm memories . no following version can exceed or equal this great album . i happily suggest that you buy this one .
2			it	hard			it must be . i m not sure why many reviewers are calling this a coming of age film . they seem to me to be already very much of age , perhaps even into mid life even before reaching university . although hers somewhat more than his , their maturity shows in their adult mannerisms and how they don not get defensive in dealing with others . there's a moving scene between the fathers after the school play when , in an empathic way , one says to the other , i m not surprised you don not talk about it . it must be very hard for anyone to understand how tough it was . movie gold from down under .
2			orleans	new	bands	great	town	great			new orleans own jimi hendrix . new orleans guitarist brian stoltz is one of the most talented musicians to come out of this great music town . he has played withe everyone from the neville brothers to bob dylan to dr john . now this solo cd features him with some of his musicial buddies who happened to be members of great bands . brian tours with the funky meters when not working in the studios . this album showcases not only his new orleans blood lines , but also has displays of his appreciation for hendrix , robert johnson , guitar slim and muddy waters .
2			it	interesting	part	impressive	nature	serial			tarzan takes paris ! that's not the whole story of course but it's an impressive part of it . tarz renounces his family name , fortune and the woman he loves , giving it all to his cousin , and he does it all in wisconsin ! yup , wisconsin . hurting from the ordeal , he heads off to paris to forget about jane . wow , the apeman in the city of lights ! so he spends time in paris , almost has an affair with a russian noblewoman , whups on her brother an evil russian spy , hangs out in art galleries and operas and eventually joins the french secret service out of boredom . all this is just the set up for the rest of the novel . the book does seem to end too quickly but i think that has more to do with the serial / pulp nature of the story's publication deadline than any fault of the author . tarzan and the return of . are an entertaining 0 e two punch . anyone who reads 1 should finish the experience by reading 2 i wish someone would make a film of this book , it's more interesting than the first one .
1			experience	similar	quality	high no	it	hot	quality	old no	motherboa	entire			be carefull . i bought this computer two years ago , i was well care with ups , the cpu fan stopped working and even the cpu has a control to turn the computer off when it is hot the gpu does not , so it burn out the gpu , to replace it i have to change the entire motherboa rd a $ 2000 computer that last only 2 years ? for me since sony products are not the old high quality they used to be . a similar experience happened to me with the blu ray reader of a ps 3
2			thunderstorm	great	distortion	electronic			great thunderstorm with birds and frogs . i really like this cd . you get varying thunder and rain instensity with birds and frogs mixed in at times . the only reason i didn not give it 5 stars is because of a strange noise that occurs a few times . it sounds like some electronic distortion or vibration . it only occurs a few times and of brief duration . i have gotten used to it and ignore it , enjoying the rest of the cd . if you like thunderstorms , i would also recommend thunderstorm by echoes of nature .
1			looks	good	words	bad	it	clean			there must be a better makeup mirror . this makeup mirror looks good but it does not la st in one year , mine rusted and the base fell off although i took care to keep it dry and clean . replacing the bulb made me say many bad words . i would give it no stars if i could .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			un animal psicodlico . in spanish . en este album , eric burdon junto con sus nuevos animales nos ingresa justo a las sensaciones y sonidos que imperaban en san francisco justo en la etapa psicodlica . si esperaban escuchar el rock bluesero de discos anteriores , olvdenlo . este es un muy buen disco representativo de los tiempos donde el amor era la bsqueda y la respuesta . donde la potente voz de burdon sigue siendo punto de referencia .
1			item	wrong	fence	electronic			wrong item listed . don not order this product ! the item detail does not explain to you that you need an electronic fence to make these collars work . these collars come with only two probes not the three needed to be an actual bark sensor and two shockers . i tried to tell customer service , but they didn not believe me . i told them to come and listen to my are still barking ! if you want these collars be prepared to spend more money to make them work .
2			i	aware	britches	little	school	elementary	books	best	sons	young			a wonderful book . little britches is one the best books we have ever read ! it has sparked a number of conversations with my young sons about character and wise choices . this morning i even pulled it out to read a quote from it after they had disobeyed me about something ! the quote is something ralph's father says to him after he ralph has lied if a man tells lies to be able to do the things he shouldn not do but wants to , his character will soon become a ruin . a man with a ruined character is a shame on the face of the earth . i highly recommend this book but please be aware that it does contain cursing ! fortunately , we are reading this aloud , so i can skip over objectionable words , but in all the reviews i have read on amazon and elsewhere , no one has mentioned this . am i the only one who objects to my elementary school aged children reading curse words ? anyway , wonderful book , highly recommended !
1			i	satisfied no	item	similar	it	difficult	instruction	normal	it	hard			missing instruction . i used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label . the company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me . in that case , i could have purchased similar item at walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if i was not satisfied . i would have sent this item back . however , shipping cost was too much .
2			book	great			i recommend this book . this was a great book i couldn not stop reading alice's adventure in wonderland i enjoyed lewis carroll's sensory detail try it
2			movie	serious	characterization	strong	movie	classic	plot	real			far far beyond a classic movie an example of karma . someone here wrote that this movie is showing its age . nothing is further from the truth . a movie like pulp fiction doesn not come close to this serious movie . this movie has pulp fiction beat all to hell because the plot is more real . the acting is at a much higher level . it's the strong characterization developed by superbly executed acting in this movie that sets the asphalt jungle above movies like pulp fiction . every character in this movie was would one in by his / her own foibles . this , is an example of karma , an eastern concept that was used in pulp crime movies of that era . john huston conciously emphasized that concept , karma , in the asphalt jungle . you will not finde a better crime genre film than this one .
2			movie	good	sci	good	acting	good			not exactly 4 stars , but close enough . i would probably give it 3.5 stars if it was an option . this was a good movie ; entertaining . way too violent for my usual tastes , however . some scenes were just over the top violent . the acting was good . overall , a good sci fi movie , definitely reminiscent of aliens , predator , etc
2			song	unique	album	great	cd	great	it	disappointing	songs	new			great cd . i have been a westlife fan for a couple of years . another great album , they have changed their style trying out new songs . each song is so unique . there are more up beat song in this albums compared to before . i have only listen to this album a couple of times . it's a little disappointing to found out that there are no songs that are completely moving like flying without wings , angel wing . westlife is known for their absolutely amazing ballads .
1			dribble	new	i	disappointed			i didn not like it . i bought this because of all of the rave reviews , but i didn not like it . i was very disappointed . i like this sort of music which i call trance music and i have many of them ; most don not live up to the expectations i thought it had , and this is cd doesn not as well . i listened to it one time . i thought it plain ordinary droll new age dribble .
1			you	suck			sony does not stand by its product . my sony vega 60 inch operated for only ten months when the screen went black . it appears to be the lamp b / c the lamp light is blinking . sony has said it is not going to honor the warranty , even though the tv operated for only ten months , b / c the warranty takes effect from the date of purchase , not the date of install . i called 3 days out of the warranty . so even though i can prove the tv was still in the box at the store , i have to pay myself this expense . no tv that costs this much should operate only ten months . sony you suck .
1			character	main	story	short			war and peace it's not . this book is better suited for a short story , as it's pace and meandering detours added nothing to the development of the characters or a plot . i never cared about anyone in the book , not even sympathy for the main character with her disability . the only reason i forced my way through the book was that it was my reading group's monthly selection . try war and peace instead it might have more pages , but you will get through it faster .
1			chris	best	fan	big no	album	bad			downright awful . soundgarden rules . no doubt about it . but if this is the best chris cornell can do on his own , he should bring the band back . this album is painfully bad . i was reaching for the advil midway through the third song . this is not anything like temple of the dog either . any moron who loved this album was not a big fan of badmotorfinger .
2			i	glad	woman	young	i	ashamed	school	high			i read a i liked it ! this is i m ashamed to say the first biography i have read since high school . it was well written , engaging and descriptive without being boring . i m so glad i stumbled across this book . it has inspired me to find other biographies of the royal family . the only drawback , in my opinion , is that a third of the book was essentially a biography of prince albert . however , the book also eloquently gives a tangible picture of who she was as a young woman before the throne and how she matured as a daughter , a wife , a mother and the queen of england .
1			disappointment	total			disappointed ! someone drew all the pictures instead of taking frames from the movie . the story also didn not flow as well as the movie . they should have done better . we bought this after liking the monsters , inc board book . but this is a total disappointment . 0 star if there is a choice .
1			something	great			didn not work for me . i was expecting something really great , but when i tried them out , it was worse than the generic ear phones that came with my zune . the sound was very tinny and far away sounding . maybe it works for other people , but it didn not for me . i bought some bose in the ear ones afterwards and they sound great .
2			onez	scary	onez	easy			oh jeez ! gosh my gosh what a windblower ! this book killed my grandma . i would eaten carrots and got some on the cover , you could like it anyway . scary onez are easy .
1			idea	bad			don not use with insta gator truck rack . bought this for thule insta gator truck bed reasons this was a bad idea 1 it didn not work . not even a little . it's supposed to engage the sliding hook arm release lever , but the internal plastic bits don not quite mesh .2 the insta gator itself works well as far as it goes , and i like it , but even if the lock worked , it offers zero security . to start , it only engages the front wheel . and while the metal parts are quite rugged , it relies on easily defeatible plasticware too hold it to the truck and to hold the hook arm in place . lock wise , you would be better off with a cable lock tied to the truck .
1			that	suck	chapters	good	book	new			what was the point ! i have been reading wheel of time since 1990 and i loved the series , but then evil things started to happen , release dates pushed back , price incresses in tor books , mr jorden missing book signings . etc , and so on . but alass i am a addict , i have so much of my time invessed in this decology ? that i had to waste my money on this that said , here is my take , there are some good chapters in the book , but you can count them on your hands , nothing gets acomplished , and you are left with a sense of no plot avancment . that sucks , with a series that streches 14 years now , you expect to move forward , buy this book , just don not read it in bed , it will put you to sleep . i think that i speed read 1 3 of the book of fluff that jordan put in just to squeeze out his requiered number of pages ! in the future mr jordan please leave your edits from the last book in the trash don not serve them up as a new book . angry wot fan , john
1			story	typical			dumb . i mean , besides tobey maguire looking kinda fine , this movie would be more of a flop to the critics than it is to me . it's categorized as an action film i don not see any heart stopping action in it . it was basically a typical childish love story about a losery guy who's had a crush on a girl for a very long time and once he's become a superhero he saves her life over and over again all of which they weren not even believable he falls for her and she falls for him and so on . conclusion ? i want my two hours and my $ . back .
1			it	compatible			disc from the uk . it should be noted to customers that if a dvd is being shipped from another country , it will not work in a dvd player made for use in the us . i assumed that since i was purchasing a movie sold on amazon's us sight , even though the item was being shipped from the uk , it would be compatible with my dvd player . unfortunately , it was not .
2			insights	important	prediction	famous	societies	various	reconstruction	interesting	subject	important	it	original no			collapse . by jared diamond is an interesting introduction . i have enjoyed collapse as the first book that i have read on the subject . jared diamond's reconstruction of collapsed societies is very interesting although i have heard lately that it is not original . garbage and feces are rarely subjects of interest but in this book they lead to important insights . diamond discusses how various societies rise and fall with emphasis on causes such as climate change and , especially , destruction of the environment . underlying his discussion is his debt to the reverend malthus who made the famous prediction that population would outstrip food supply . clearly , this theory is validated over and over again . i gave the book 4 stars because it could have used better editing . there is some needless repetition and wordiness . however , i think that he offers a very interesting introduction to an important and timely subject .
2			thankyou	hard			she who remembers . im trying to find this book in hard back . you only have it paper back . i would really appreatiate if you can find this book in hard back thankyou
2			advice	good	it	repetitive	issue	recent	guide	detailed	periodical	good			best running magazine by default . i have subscribed to rw for about 5 years . i am a marine and i run lots of miles every week and about one race per month . this magazine offers good nutrition and training advice , and it also provides quality shoe reviews each season . the race guide leaves a lot to be desired , but then again , you can only devote so mnay pages to that subject . the website has a better and more detailed guide . the primary problem with rw is that it is very repetitive . my most recent issue had a picture of a female runner on the cover doing abdominal work . i scratched my head and pulled out my issues from last year and found a different girl doing the same thing on the cover of the same month in 2002 in any event , this overall is a good periodical for the money and trounces the competition in the running magazine category .
2			it	funny	son	old	it	cute			a miracle worker . i have been trying to get my 4 yr old son interested in learning his letters for the past year . nothing worked , until the letter factory came . he loved watching this dvd and would actually request it . he learned all his letters and their sounds within the week ! it was a miracle ! my husband who was concerned about him was shocked ! he still likes to watch it because he thinks it's funny . and i must admit i laughed several times myself when i watched it with him . it's cute . i definitely would recommend this dvd !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			unsolicited faxes ! i would never buy this book ! they sent us a fax with no return fax number and no way to be removed from their fax li st there was no contact number of any sort . this is a very sleazy way to do business and i would never buy a book from a company who would do this !
1			i	disappointed			disappointing . i sure hope that first review i saw was accurate , because i just finished listening to it for the 1 st time and i am really disappointed . i only like 3 tracks on it , i don not think it has the rythems that leftism had , in fact most of the rythems and drum lines a mundane or just don not spark any interest , and i kinda wish i hadn not bought the cd . sure hope it changes next time i listen to it .
1			disappointment	big	camera	hard	idea	great	push	extra			disappointed . bought the camera to take in my kayak . nice and small , put in a baggie , handle with wet hands , splashes , etc great idea and size . i think the camera is very hard to hold still . many photos are blurred all over , moving subjects are almost always blurred . i think it must have the shutter speed of an instamatic about 1 30 of a second . i think the problem is with the shutter release . getting the focus is easy the extra push to take the image is ha rd on a tripod using the timer , touched by no hands , the camera works perfectly . otherwise it's a challenge and a big disappointment .
2			look	good			shoo goo . my son , who is a skater , needed something to repair his favorite skate shoes , duct tape just didn not look good ! he saw a video recommending shoo goo , it sounded like just the thing we needed to fix his shoes , so we tried it . it worked great , but i wish that i had chosen the clear , as i chose black and the result was less than i expected . i will definitely buy this product again , but i will choose clear instead of black !
1			book	incredible	problems	real	us	deep			incredible book ! literally incredible . i mean it lacks a scintilla of credibility . how far does someone have to go with wild , speculative , unsupportable , obviously illogical theories before every human being , even the most gullible , would say do you think . . nahh ! clearly we as a people are desperate to find meaning , even if we have to impose the most inane theory imaginable on our world . and how convenient that it asks so little of us look ! we are already mostly water ! that alone makes us deep ! please , people get a grip ! we have real problems to address that won not be fixed by feeling all gooey about being all wet .
1			person	next	sound	terrible	sound	bad			the sound is bad wait for the repressing ! i love south park as much as the next person , but the sound on this set is absolutely terrible , especially on the first disc it goes from loud to almost inaudible and back . i found it incredibly distracting , especially since i love this show . i called paramount , who admitted there was a problem and that they are working on repressing the set sidenote they took my number down but have yet to call me back regarding a refund . long story short wait until you are sure the problem has been fixed before spending your money .
1			development	little			cheap . broke after just a few swings . threads don not lock so it just gets whacked a bit and then breaks . a little product development would have showed the flaws in this product rather quickly no need to mass market it and then annoy the heck out your consumers . franklin sports should have the tagline building products that build land fills . feh . so annoyed . can you tell ?
2			cowboys	fun			what can you say about seeing so many . hollywood icons on screen . other than they should have chosen a different project . space cowboys was fun enough , but lacked the gravitas of unforgiven for instance . the believability factor of four geezers being sent on a orbital repair mission was stretched beyond willful suspension of they chosen a project other than this , perhaps a last ride of the . type action / comedy / western , i believe we as audience members would have gone along for the ride with a bit more gusto .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not what i expected . i watched the movie and loved the opera songs in it so i ordered the sound track thinking the songs would be part of it . i was dissappointed to find that none of the opera songs were on it . the theme song was repeated several times in different versions . i like a variety of songs from a movie soundtrack and unfortunately this did not have it . listening to the theme song over and over got a little boring after awhile .
2			i	pleased			highlander 6 . i am very pleased with the set of tapes i purchased . as always they came in excellent condition and a timely manner .
2			seems	happy	it	easy	thing	best			very pleased . i would recomend this product to got this for my daughter who is 10 for her first hamster . it was easy to assemble , and is very easy to clean , and her hamster seems very happy with it as well . only down side is when the silly hamster stuffs her cheeks full of food and then spits it out in her wheel and tries to run , the sound is not pleasing but the sight of the hamster trying to run in a wheel full of food very funny . the best thing for me though was the price in stores i found this same item for just at $ 50 !
2			fun	great	history	great	countdown	final	story	compelling	carrier	modern			great fun . this book seems to have been inspired by the final countdown that great alternate history / sci fi film about a modern aircraft carrier going back in time to days before pearl harbor . the book expands on the theme by sending a multinational fleet from our near future back to the middle of wwii . while the multiple characters do get confusing , the story is really compelling as the author runs in all directions with themes untouched in the final countdown . if you loved that movie , you will love this book .
2			gear	extra	i	impressed	i	happy	rack	perfect	quality	high	bike	nice			i love this rack ! i am totally happy with this rack . i have a nice lightweight road bike that i don not want to clutter with a fixed rack but i wanted to have the capability to carry some extra gear or run some errands when i felt like it . this rack is perfect for that . i am impressed with the high quality material and welds , and the quick release function works great . i just did a 40 mile ride to costco and stocked up with a rack trunk fits perfectly on the delta rack under my saddle full of vitamins etc the rack was rock solid and vibration free . the tag that comes with the rack actually states a carry capacity of 40 lbs vs . the 25 mentioned here but i would be a bit wary of that much load . very high quality , nice lightweight rack with super easy on and off mounting . five stars all the way for my purposes .
1			moron	complete	actor	great	brainer	essential	movies	predictable	luck	hard	girl	young			the essential no brainer for all the half wits out there . i have never reviewed on amazon before , but when i saw that this movie had 5 stars , i knew it was time . if you are just a complete moron and love movies that anybody with any intelligence would find trite , you are in luck . this is easily one of the most predictable movies i have ever seen . and the acting is truly a masterpiece . keanu reeves . . i didn not think that it was possible to top speed . and , boy , has al pacino hit upon hard luck . what happened to the great actor we knew and loved in the godfather and dog day afternoon ? who else have we got ? well , we have got the guy who played the principal in ferris bueller as the devil's right hand man . and we have got the girl from mighty joe young as keanu's wife . just an all star ca st but if you do see it , see it for the plot .
1			movie	old	price	low	sights	important	reviews	previous			not worth the money , even at a low price . i ordered this without benefit of having seen the previous reviews . having taken the russian river cruise , i was looking for something visually impressive by which to remember the sights and the journey . unfortunately , this was not it . i concur in everything in the previous reviews . the content is superficial at best and does no justice to the country or to the cruise . the folklore show to which so much of the dvd is devoted is actually only an optional tour on most of the cruises , one which we elected to pass up with no regrets , while many of the more important sights were completely omitted . finally , the photographic quality is just dreadful , not much better if any than an old home movie . this is not worth the money at any price .
1			it	boring	pages	previous			slow , boring , jumps from past to present too often . i had heard how wonderful this books was , but i found it slow , boring , and the writer jumps around from past to present so often , that i found myself not even knowing who the characters were i had to stop and either think about who the character was or actually go back through previous pages to refresh my memory as to who they were . to be quite honest , i so loathed the way this book was written that i didn not even bother finishing it . if a book doesn not pique my interest in 50 pages , then it isn not worth my time to finish . this book definitely was not worth my time .
2			esays	small	coverage	serious	overview	good	photos	good	survey	good			good overview . this is parlor table size book . it has well written factual small esays and good photos . essays are a good quick survey of aircrft milestones and have serious factual coverage . due to size i reluctantly passed it on rather quickly . great if you have the room , otherwise read , enjoy , reread , learn and pass it on .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			perry mason , season 8 set 2 . the price on this item is totally out of line ! let's be reasonable ! the other dvds in the perry mason series average around $ 30 -35
1			assistance	military			gives you that cozy feeling ! delightful yarn about an american soldier who betrays his country by providing firearms and military assistance to the enemy , then assists in the massacre of several of his fellow soldiers when they attempt to bring him to justice . great for the whole family !
2			harry	good no			lurve it ! it was pretty darn then again its harry will never ever ever ever not be good to me .
1			actors	good	we	disappointed	something	big			a waste of time . i m not going to write a long review because , frankly , it's all been said . i went to see this movie with two friends , and we were all disappointed . right from the start you get the feeling that you have already missed something big , and the film continues to get more and more absurd and illogical from there . there are several good actors in this film aaron eckhart , scarlett johannsson , josh hartnett , hilary swank but not one of them gives a decent performance here you want to do yourself a favor then skip this film . it's a waste of time , simple as that .
1			seems	flimsy	product	solid no	brands	compatible	number	limited	it	difficult			not a solid product . i purchased by rio 600 after my rio 500 inexplicably quit working altogether . i would have used another brand , but i primarily use the mp 3 player to listen to books from and there are a limited number of compatible brands . the rio 600 seems really flimsy , the buttons don not work consistently and the battery gage shows full and then jumps to empty within 2 minutes . in addition , the unit emits noise through the output that makes it very difficult for me to use with my soundfeeder which is a device that broadcasts the output onto fm radio , so that i can listen in my car without having a cassette input . i would avoid sonicblue products if possible .
2			video	poor	information	extra	quality	fine	it	comparable	medium	fantastic	dvd	poor	it	worth			excellent movie , poor quality dvd , poor quality video . my wife and i really enjoyed this delightful movie about two friends and their developing relationship . you will have to stick out the first 10 20 minutes as this entertainer has a slow start , but ultimately it's worth were very disappointed in the quality of the dvd as well as the video . it was comparable to an ok video tape . the sound quality is fine , but the extra information isn not . the shame on you goes to the richard diercks company , incorporation , and simitar for taking such a fantastic medium and reducing it to an example of what not to do in dvd production , development , and video transfer .
1			video	good	video	worth			great until you use your phone . video was good and appeared to be worth the price . unfortunately , it has limited channels only 2 and they just don not offer enough flexibility to deal with any other 900 mhz syste ms not only does it creates static on my cordless phone but when the phone is in use , the video signal goes completely out . so alas , back to the store this you only have 2.4 ghz systems in use at your house , this one will probably work for you .
2			mood	great	mobility	extra	access	free	i	amazed	effort	real	way	great			fun as well as a work out . it takes a real effort for me to get up in the morning and work out , and i never have time later in the day . this video , however , is a lot of fun , and puts me in a great mood . i m more of a couch potato than a fitness buff , so i love hemalayaa's smile and have fun approach . i m always amazed afterwards how even the tamest 15 minute work out can make my muscles burn . this is a great and motivating way to get moving in the morning and do something good for yourself . i also love the extra mobility of getting free access to the video through amazon's on demand service . i hope that initiative gets expanded .
1			novel	graphic	director	great	it	interesting	film	realistic	movie	good	potential	great	violence	gross	scenes	necessary no	job	bad			an embarrassment to cinema . i m sure this review will be rated as unhelpful simply because people disagree with my opinion , but i have to tell you this movie was absolutely synopsis sounds as if it would be really interesting , and i m sure the graphic novel was really well done , but the movie fell waaaay short . adding ridiculously gross violence and absurd and unnecessary pornographic sex scenes doesn not make a film edgy or gritty or realistic , it just makes it seem almost juvenille in it's attempt to pretend to be i went to see this , several audience members got up and walked out of theatre . the saddest part is that this movie could have been really good . there really were some themes that might have made for a thought provoking movie . and of course this is a great director . but this movie is a perfect example of taking a concept with great potential and doing a really really bad job .
2			book	easy			whispers of the wicked saints . this was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on , not easy to put left me wanting to read the follow on , which i hope is coming soon . i used to read a lot but have gotten away from it . this book made me want to read again . very enjoyable .
2			it	awesome	song	typical	d	hot	touch	wrong	i	old	it	beautiful			truly amazing . for the first time in my life , i have listened to a cd all the way through multiple times ! and loved every single song . the album ? clay aiken's measure of a man . some critics bash clay for not singing the typical pop song about sex and drugs although i have to disagree with the sex part . touch is pretty hot d , but honestly , what's so wrong with having morals ? i think it's awesome and admirable . everyone can respect clay for this album , and he really is making a revolution in the music the record , i m 18 years old ; i m a member of that britney spears and christina aguilera generation . haha . i highly recommend this album to everyone , clay fans and clay hatahs alike . it's uplifting and beautiful . very inspiring , emotional , and passionate . hooray for clay !
1			it	horrible	cd	suck			man . oh man . three simple words this cd sucks it's absolutely horrible , all you hear is rah rah rah rah rooooaaaah ! there's no vocals , and the lyrics , well throw those babies out the window all i can say is if you want the crappiest cd known to man , here it is , six feet under with . warpath
2			shoes	nice			capisette worked for me ! i had suffered with edema for a number of years . when i saw the ad for this product i decided to try it . it not only worked well , but after only using it for 3 months i no longer suffer with swollen ankles and legs . i can enjoy walking , wearing dresses and nice shoes again ! i recommend this product .
1			information	serious	stars	stars no	errors	numerous			zero stars . it is unfortunate that this book's usefulness as an authoritative source is compromised by numerous glaring errors . on the plus side the illustrations are first 's a pretty book , but if you are looking for serious information , look elsewhere .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			get what you pay for . i might buy it fir less than 10 bucks . cheap material . cheap construction .
2			problem	big	forum	particular	favorite	least	disappointment	big	disc	free	fox	aware	movie	good			the movie is good , blu ray audio quality is suspect . this is my least favorite in the series . the video quality of the blu ray is much improved from the sd dvd . the audio however is a big problem . depending on what type of blu ray player you have , you may not get any sound or only the core dts . there was a problem with authoring this disc and fox has been aware of it since the disc was released . i and other on a particular forum have been waiting more than 1 year now for fox to release a replacement but the replacement they sent was exactly the same disc . unless you get a blu ray version from the u . k . or australia this disc is region free you may not get what you want from the audio . a big disappointment from fox .
2			thanks	dead	rules	dead			one thing . i love the dead thanks to heidi but i didn not like china cat sunflower on this album . i compared it to the live version on hundred year hall , which made that song my favorite song of all time . i m not even an expert , sorry . either way , the dead rules !
2			purchase	best no			dried up . this wasn not the best purchase i have made , the product dried up in the bottle after a few months . i wouldn not purchase again .
2			pallor	hard	it	amazing	world	popular			the metaverse prophecy . as an employee of linden lab the company behind the popular virtual world , second life , i found this book prophetic . it's amazing to think many years ago stephenson was writing the blueprint for what would exist in metaverses , like second life , but he did , and he nailed it . his vision overall of online 3 d communities , even down to the details , is poignant , well thought out , and an author myself and reader , i found the book still very engaging , but at times meandering and arrhythmic . however , much of this unique style , blended with stephenson's dystopian descriptions of the future , gives snow crash an engaging pallor that is hard to turn away book obviously has a core cyberpunk readership , but i would encourage anyone to read this who is interested in the emergence of 3 d virtual worlds and the effect they may have on the future of reality .
1			inspection	basic			amazon sent me a tampered box set . when i got the dvd set for christmas i realized the plastic was split on one side and carefully taped closed . when i opened it i found two dvds missing . never got the replacment in time for christmas , you would think these things recieved a basic inspection before shipment .
2			process	creative	looks	flawless			platinum edition sets platinum standards of excellence . snow white and the seven dwarfs chosen by horror novelist ramsey campbell as the most terrifying movie he has ever seen , well everyone as at least on traumatic disney viewing experience in their youth for me it's bambi set the foundation upon which all of disney's follow up animated features would be built . any fan of disney , or animated movies in general , will see this as a required addition to their almost limitless immersive dvd features will take months to watch and allow people a rare look into the creative process of mounting such a technically challenging project the first of its kind as film itself looks flawless , no speck , no grain , no fading , the colors just as bright and vibrant today as they were in 1937 it is a mint condition presentation of a platinum standard film that set the mold . not only highly recommended , but , as i said , a required addition to any film buff's library .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			do not purchase . these cds are garbage . i purchased them , thinking that the $ 1 difference between these and memorex wouldn not cause any proble ms wrong . i have gone through half the stack trying to burn one cd . and i m using a sony computer . i have only had about 3 cds turn out ok , with one of them skipping a lot . warning to all buyers , stay away .
1			tunes	good			kind of different formula , still a boy band . i hated nsync and being a guy , it is my right but then that ever so catchy tune called pop and well , i had to buy it . what i found was the most heavily produced and voice altering cd i have heard ! between the sampling and digital crap , you can hardly make out the lyrics which is probably be st if they don not want to be a boy band , they can do two things 1 stop doing mushy and gooey ballads 2 write about something else other than themselves pop is self righteous or girls and dive into more lyrically challenged stuff . the cd does serve up some good tunes . mainly , pop and the game is over but nsync has yet to find their nitch .
2			progression	natural	character	main	landmark	classic			number 9 and getting better all the time . for those who love kathleen mallory , and who doesn not , this is the natural progression of excellent mystery , interpersonal relationships and the psychological growth of the main character . there is plenty of police work and lots of information about what to many of us is a classic landmark , route 66 i have read them all and they just keep getting better .
2			movies	best	results	final	movie	entire	character	strong			amazing . like other reviewers , i was crying hard throughout the entire movie . i don not think it matters if you agree with euthanasia or not , the movie goes much deeper than that . each character is strong , and absolutely moving . the issues make you think about disabilities , death , life , poverty , love , friendship , family , etc . it's really a beautiful film , despite the final results . one of the best movies i have ever seen .
2			beginning	stupid	rest	good			mars movies . i like anything mars . the beginning was stupid . like watching home movies from the apollo astronauts before they went to the moon . but the rest was good . not great like apollo 13 but i still liked it . the ending left me puzzeled . if the aliens were our ancestors and seeded earth , why did they kill some of our people ?
2			film	short	i	glad			the land before time . my son loves this movie it is an amazing childrens short film that is sure to capture their attention if they are in to dinosaurs . i watched these as a child and am glad to have found them on dvd for my child to watch .
1			weight	low	weight	nice	hum	constant	features	nice	sound	loud	support	current	wasn	helpful no			think about another player . this is my second rio one and both had the same problem . there is a constant hum sound that is loud enough to be very distracting . they need to fix the audio sound qality on this unit . there should be no humming sound period . have you ever hooked up a record player to your amp and you didn not ground it and you heard that constant loud hum . that's the audio quality of the rio one . second , i have only had the second one for a week and today it is just flashin usb on screen . tech support wasn not helpful and suggested i buy another company's product . the only current support for this flashing usb message is to return it for replacement . features and the low weight are nice . it simply is to bad the rest wasn not good .
1			fans	die	movies	worst	fans	hard			city hunter . this is one of jackie chan's worst movies . i know he was trying something different with this movie but it just didn not was way over the top and it really wasn not that funny . i really didn not care for much of the had some weird scenes in it also . i guess making the comic into a movie didn not translate to 's still a worth a watch though for the stunts and for the die hard jackie fans but i would just rent , not buy .
1			try	nice	book	good no	version	japanese			not an extremly good book . for people who have seen the japanese version of dbz / gt they wont be very pleased with this book nice try but needs a lot more work .
1			one	good	filth	disappointed	acting	superb			ok . i was a disappointed with the uncessary filth that hollywood sticks in movies that might otherwise be a decent movie ; the story line was a good one , acting was superb , but .
1			ms	proud	drive	hard			just another warmed over game . microsoft , in their infinite wisdom , has decided to warm over their fs 98 version with this clunker . after gobbling up more than 1 gigabyte of hard drive to do a custom load they still want you to do a lot of cd swapping just to play the game . at least with fs 98 you can load it and play it off your hard drive . iv e spent more time loading and , swapping cd's than i have playing fs 2000 nothing too whoopee about their so called improved graphics either . a few little frills here and , there . i m sure ms is proud of the fact that to start the game you have to verify each time by loading the cd's , taking from 1 to 3 minutes . bummer .
1			it	defective	service	good	they	nice	they	helpful			dead on arrival . the collar quite simply did not work at all . i called the number given in the brochure to get help . to my surprise they were really nice and helpful . we determined that it was defective and needed to be returned . it is because of the good customer service that i gave the product two stars , otherwise it would have been one .
1			information	new	examples	basic			save your cash ! this book is a waste of paper ! it is full of errors . the examples are basic and when they are not full of errors do not illustrate or reinforce the points in the book . it does not follow a logical flow when discussing the concepts . i must agree that this one was rushed to press ! it did nothing to prepare me for the exam ! nor did it give me any new information on the product . save your $$$ and put it toward your exam since you will likely take it twice !
1			i	happy			maybe good , but yuck . i am still awaiting any immense benefits , but the only way i can drink this is in orange juice while holding my nose . it's been just over a week , so i will be happy to give further updates and let you know if i get use to the awful taste . rating is based on taste alone . after my first try , it sat for two weeks before i was brave enough to try again . hopeful
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			disappointing . generic charles fort . covers a decent range of creatures but is very biased leaning toward the skeptical book to introduce cryptozoology or folkore to kids on .
2			teqacher	high	he	great	school	high			better than high school . i was privileged to have frank mccourt as a high scool english teqacher at stuyvesant . he was great there , but this book is realy one of the finest i have read in years . congratulations
2			movies	entire	fantasies	hate	effects	fantastic	effects	special			in 3 words , just plain magic . i can not believe people didn not like this one as much . i love fantasy films and nanny mcfee returns is a million times better than the fir st the special effects were fantastic . people were saying their wasn not enough nanny mcfee in this film however she was through out the entire movies . if you don not like this movie you must hate fantasies .
1			cds	new	recordings	original	range	original	sound	original			warning new cds severely volume compressed . buyer beware . most cd companies today use digital hyper compression to make their remastered recordings sound as loud as possible . this results in very harsh sounding music . there are few music companies that still produce good sounding oldies cd companies are completely clueless of the need to preserve the original hi fi sound of the original lp recordings and have now affectively destroyed the rock oldies portion of the music business . anyone wanting original full range sound today is advised to purchase a cd recorder such as denon etc and convert their lps to cd .
1			xml	impressive	job	great	book	good			similar to the preface of a good book . does a great job telling what xml can do , but somehow forgets to show you how its done ! be prepared to buy other references to fill in the gaping holes . despite the book , xml is rather impressive , though still in its infancy . i recommend the language , not the book .
1			none	interesting	something	dramatic			yawn . i found this book incredibly boring . at no time are you really encouraged to care about any of these people , none of them are particularly interesting , and nothing really happens . it's the dreary , grey , spiritless story of dreary , grey , spiritless people . the heroine has a touch of spunk and strength to her , which is cancelled out by her choosing to be a doormat for everyone . i kept waiting for something dramatic or inspiring or , well , interesting to break out . never happened .
2			rupert	funny	they	boring	i	bored	it	funny	it	entertaining			wasn not a fan until this movie . i personally wasn not looking forward to going to see harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban . im 20 years old and a college student and didnt get the whole harry potter thing . i made a promise to my younger brother for his b day that i would take him to see it . ive seen the first 2 and thought they were boring . so it was only naturally that when i went into the movie theather i was expecting to be really bored and falling asleep . instead it was actually funny and entertaining so much that ive even borrowed my brother's books and went to see the movie 3 more times . i dont want to say alot about the movie itself except go and see it for yourself but i was say daniel and emma were brillant in it and rupert was extremely funny esp . when he awakes from the nightmare about the spiders it makes me laugh even thinking about it .
2			character	main	books	next	cross	good	characters	humorous	read	easy	idea	great no			funny . stephanie plum main character is a riot ! there are also other very humorous characters , namely grandma mazur . this was the first book in the series that i have read and before finishing it i went out and ordered the next 10 books . it is an easy read with a lot of fun along the way . i often caught myself laughing out loud . maybe not such a great idea in a public place . people might think your nuts but what the for it for any of you that have read harlen coben's myron bolitar series or sue grafton's a z series you might find stephanie to be a good cross between myron and kinsey . whom both i love i highly recommend this book and the series .
1			bore	entire	movies	bad	script	bad	script	terrible	music	good	scenes	funny	movies	long	good	crisp			bad script boring movie one of the worst ever . first for the good the video transfer was very well done on dvd colors were very crisp and accurate music was also pretty good although nothing spectacular . now for the bad . bad script bad script bad script . i can not belive pitt & roberts actually agreed to do this terrible script . the movie had no life and it just dragged and dragged and dragged . scenes that were supposed to be funny just didn not fly . i just barely made it through this entire 2 hour bore without turning it off . why are bad movies always long ?
2			states	united	fun	magical	i	glad	it	magical			magical fun ! i waited about six months before i chose to plunge into the second book in the harry potter series . i just had too many other books to read on my li st anyway , i m glad i decided to read this one . the one thing about harry potter is that you the reader escape to a fantasy world filled with magical fun . i love how the books end with key morals to the story , too . there are definite messages that we must live by . the last 4 or 5 chapters in this sequel really keep one on edge for what happens next ! i understand hp & the sorcerers stone philosophers stone , the movie , is released on november 19 2001 here in the the united states warner brothers quickly starts filming the sequel chamber of secrets in november 2001 for fear of the stars getting older haha . i can not wait to see the the character still photos i saw in the vanity fair october 2001 issue it will be magical relatively close to the book storyline so we potter reading fans shouldn not be too disappointed .
1			movie	bad	i	sorry	beings	unknown	movie	ridiculous	disappointment	huge	effects	special no	disappointment	terrible	actors	good	it	realistic no			huge disappointment a very bad movie ! i m sorry , but this movie was ridiculous ! a drunken pilot saves the world from an alien invation ! ! it takes one person two minutes to figure out how to operate an alien spacecraft ? president goes to fight in a war against unknown beings ? let's get real here ! if it weren not for the special effects this movie would be pure garbage ! none of it makes any sense and it is totally unrealistic . it was a terrible disappointment to see good actors in such a lousy movie in my opinion it diminished their image somewhat . that movie taught me to think twice before ever looking at another roland emmerich movie .
1			it	horrible			junk . i like john travolta but this was the dumbest movie ever put on film . hard to follow , no plot . it was horrible , worst movie i have seen . don not waste your time or your money .
1			music	modern	music	original	music	annoying	reissue	big			don not buy this reissue . if this repackage is the big beat reissue , it is a ripoff and it will ruin our listening experience of two milestones in modern music . for one thing , volume 1 and 2 were carelessly packed on the same cd , a debatable choice , but let's say not dramatic . where it hurts is the passage from one track to the other , where audible ticks and music discontinuity kills the original music is particularity annoying on volume 2 theoretically there are 20 titles or so on the album , but when it came out , we listened to side one and then side two has a whole , not even noticing the passage from one song to the other . but this re edition artificially reminds you that the track has changed , certainly not the way this masterpiece was intended . i simply threw this re edition in the garbage and ordered the single re editions , hoping i will get better quality .
1			life	short	it	difficult			i could only read 257 pages of it before i threw it down . oh man . i just finished reading sk's book on writing when i saw dark tower 5 at the library . if you want to see king break a lot of the rules he sets forth in on writing this is the book to read . it was so difficult to get through . life is too short to spend reading fiction like this . to be fair i haven not read it all . i m hoping someone has and i might still yet finish it .
2			skin	clear	pills	free			after all the money i spent . . . . i found out these almost free pills gave my miniature schnauzer a beautiful coat . i started using these about 3 weeks ago and the dog's skin is clear . this after blood tests , mail order dog food , cortizone shots , food supplements , you name it . dang !
1			bit	little			book review . this book was a little bit more damaged than listed in the description . had a rip on the front cover binding .
1			soup	warm	reviewer	previous	soup	hot	water	hot			not effective . i purchased this thermos locally and i agree with the previous reviewer . it does not keep food warm for long . i preheated the thermos with very hot water , added very hot soup . the soup was luke warm , at best , 3 hours later .
2			it	expensive			canon mb -5 battery pack . i have a canon power shot sx 210 s . i called canon to make sure this was the correct battery pack for it and they told me it was . i started to order it with canon but it was much more expensive through them than through amazon so i ordered it from amazon instead . it came quickly and works wonderfully . i hadn not realized how much i missed taking digital photos that i could share online with friends and family in other states and areas .
2			bulbs	total	way	expensive no			stocking up too . an inexpensive way to stock up before they stop selling them in the near future . i bought 4 cases of 24 and tested all of the bulbs the day i received them via ups . out of 96 total bulbs , 9 were either broken , would not light at all or burn out immediately upon testing . i expected a few to fail but not 9 oh well , that's to be expected if you ship light bulbs .
1			story	great	fun	good	comics	best	characters	great	piece	inspiring	animation	great			think for yourself . this is one of the best comics i have read in a while and the anime is faithful . great characters , goofy plot lines , and great animation . everyone has a great back story and one piece can be very touching and inspiring but its mostly good fun , though not always clean . anyone who cares to read will see that both the comic and anime are for teens though the story is generally light hearted . i can not recommend this piece of art enough to fans of action adventure stories in the vein of dragon ball . much inspiration for one piece is credited to akira toriyama by eiichiro oda himself . i only give it one star because today is opposite day .
1			book	recent	examples	traditional	introduction	useful	text	recent			old and useful , but get something else . even though the fifth edition of this book was published in 1961 this book still gives a useful and brief introduction to probability . however , if you are going to buy a book to learn statistics or probability , i would suggest a more recent book . they may not be as brief and concise as this , but newer books would be more up to date . one interesting thing about the gnedenko / khinchin book is their examples and problems , which involve things such as the production of artillery shells , or hitting targets with cannons . it is a very welcome change from the traditional , but obvious examples that use decks of cards or dice . also , it says things about the audience for whom this book was originally meant , and the relevant topics of the time of the cold war . still , i suggest a more recent text .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			do not order this item . i have placed an order for this item twice and never received it . it appears on pending orders when tracking packages then completely disappears from the recently placed orders li st i need to see if i am being charged for this by amazon . but please don not order it from amazon find another source .
2			it	perfect	member	curious			my favorite children's story . my dad read this book to me when i was growing up . it's always been my favorite . now i read it to my son . it's definitely not a politically correct book but it's perfect for any small intelligent , insatiably curious member of a rather non p c family .
2			cds	best			so cool ! this is one of the best cds i have listened to . all the songs are exellent ! definately recommended
1			seasons	bad			warning region locked ! i live in europe and i just spend more than $ 100 including customs on the breaking bad seasons 1 2 and 3 unfortunately i can not play them . however , this information is nowhere to be found . not on amazon , not on the box , not on the internet database . the only way to find out is after spending a lot of money and putting the disc in the player . you get a screen which says to look on the box for more information . however , there is no information to be found anywhere . supposedly sony recently started to make their discs region locked without warning .
1			way	easy	price	good			i haven not recieved it . i still don not have this item and there doesn not seem to be an easy way to get the tracking done . amazon sends do not reply emails , ups says it was delivered to the porch , and the shipper has to request a trace but , the shipper hasn not responded to me ! it looks like the product i need and the price was good , but , my money is gone and i have got nothing ! this is probably not the review you were hoping for .
1			flow	good			not universal . this is not a universal toilet tank lever ; it will not work with a side mounted toilet . as the other reviewer noted , it will not life the rubber flap high enough to get good flow . i messed with this for several hours before returning it . avoid .
1			stars	stars no	revival	great	band	small	revival	new			give me a break ! we are used to the 1960 being given unjustifiable credit for everything from toast to angel's wings , but this is ridiculous ! the great new orleans jazz revival began in the late 1930 with blue note records , and had peaked by the late 1950 . the 1960 had nothing to do with it , even though a small band of enthusiasts continued to worship the style , stultifying it in the process . zero stars , if it were possible
2			ending	great	planet	mysterious			most intelligent movie i have seen in a while . i loved this movie . it is about four astronouts who crash on to a mysterious planet . all of them die in the first 20 minutes except for charlie heston who is captured by the natives . people like apes . the ending is great and this is a must have . i give it scraches a five onto a prison cell wall five stars !
2			lady	young	man	young			easily top five material . i absolutely love this movie . it's a movie about a young lady , a very shy and unsure young lady , who meets a young man and falls in love with him . they have good times and some bad times . a friend of the young lady finds out about this and thwarts the relationship before it even starts .
1			gore	limited	fan	big	gore	necessary no	silence	right	change	enormous			doesn not even compare to the fir st i read silence of the lambs right before i read hannibal and because of that i was expecting something remarkable . however , i was thouroughly let down . the book started off with the same tone as the first , but as the book progressed the tone went off track . another thing that i hated was the enormous change in clarice . her mannerisms , attitude , and even her speech changed with no basis for a change whatsoever . lastly , one thing that made the first so incredible was the limited gore . it was only added when absolutley necessary . in hannibal , the gore was completely unnecessary and sometimes i couldn not even begin to understand why it was in there . i don not really recommend reading this book , especially if you are a big fan of the fir st
2			courage	negative			an american story . a wonderful autobiography of the american jewish immigrant , going out into a totally different world , from the familiar . overcoming staggering odds , language , culture , financial , education and above all racisism . the book shows determination to succeed , and without stating . points out how much we all have in common with each other . the courage of the family was only negative , the typesetting , could have been proof read better , many typo's .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			will not buy again ! this product will not stay in place no matter what ! slides right down the leg . i tried several ways of keeping it in place . save your money .
2			season	bad	i	disappointed	season	complete			veronica mars the complete third season . as much as i love veronica mars , i was rather disappointed in the way the series ended . i want to know what happens with veronica and logan , or how bad the sheriff's election was . these questions were never answered . i did , however , enjoy the season 4 preview . too bad the season never aired .
1			movie	worst	waste	biggest			horrible . this was the worst movie i have ever seen adam sandler dissapointed me alot ! very sad i do not reccomend this movie for anyone biggest waste of time
1			coffee	weak	confidence	complete	coffee	good			makes krap koffee . ladies and gentlemen , i can say this with complete confidence keurig machines do not make good coffee . both of my lazy siblings and my stepmom bought them because of excellent marketing . after experimenting many , many times and honestly trying to get a decent cup of coffee out of them , i give up . i would rather have nothing than this blech . if you want a cup of something vaguely resembling weak coffee in 30 seconds , spend your $ 170 on this . if you want honest to god coffee , get a press pot or a cheap drip maker from goodwill that steeps the grounds for / 5 minutes . the garbage folgers we put in a perculator at bsa camp makes much better coffee . seriously .
1			book	boring	book	horrible	book	fun	character	major			eragon a book ? eragon is a horrible book but it gets boring as it goes on . trust me this book is so boring i fell asleep trying to read it . i especially didn not like the part where bron died . a book is no fun when a major character like bron dies . if are going to read it i do not recommend it time and if you read it i apologies .
2			story	true	tome	little			a renaissance man . funny to think that this awesome and tireless historian , page smith , author of a magisterial eight volume series on american history sidelines as a children's book illustrator ! check out the terrific little tome , florence the goose a true story for children of all ages . the japanese inspired block print drawings of florence are wistful , delicate and that's a renaissance man !
2			movie	great	amazon	great	price	fantastic	i	glad	dvd	special	it	worth	day	big			awsome ! i bought the 300 2 disk special edition dvd for my fiance for christmas and he watched it twice already . the 2 d dvd is loaded with extras . we both enjoyed the movie in the theatre so i know he would love it . amazon was great . if you have seen this movie , it's worth getting it to add to any home collection . if you haven not seen it yet , it is a really great gladiator style movie that men will love . the price was fantastic . the only thing i do recommend is if you are ordering before christmas , make sure you do so well in advance , because they ship usps and they are much slower than ups or fedex . i ordered on 12 10 and estimated arrival date was supposed to be the 12 14 and i didn not get it till the package till 12 22 i was glad it came before the big day .
1			movie	bad	puppets	right	characters	interesting no	sense	real	it	bad	plot	interesting no			shadow puppets is right ! ender's game and speaker for the dead are two of my most favorite books . this flimsy excuse for a book seemed like just another attempt by card to cash in on the success of the rest of the franchise . i wonder if he realizes that while he may gain profits in the short the long term it only serves to denigrate and hurt the whole series . i found the characters uninteresting as they seemed to really be puppets , acting out the desires of the author with no real sense of purpose or reason . other than thats where the author wanted to go . the plot was uninteresting and made me feel like i was watching a bad b or c if there is such a thing sci fi movie . i am starting to wonder if william shatner shadow wrote this book . it's that bad . don not waste your time .
1			we	wrong			advertising in the form of a magazine . we received our first issue of national geographic kids today and promptly cancelled it the same day . i didn not even want my son to see it . not only is it filled with advertising but the science articles are unsophisticated and tabloid ish . i wish we had read the reviews before ordering . we assumed that this would be comparable to world magazine and were terribly wrong .
1			movie	great	candidate	best	scenes	dramatic	picture	best			why did this win best picture ? it is a great action movie . keyword there is action . best picture is supposed to be a drama , and gladiator is far from and excellent drama . in fact all the dramatic scenes were pretty bogus . i cant even believe people voted gladiator the best best picture of all time . gladiator should never have won best picture . if action movies won at the oscars than why hasn not arnold won an oscar . arnold's action beats ridley scott's any day . another epic by another aussie is 6 thousand times better braveheart . william wallace has chunks of guys like maximus in his stool . braveheart is far and away a better best picture candidate . in fact every other best picture winner is better than gladiator , because gladiator never should have won best picture .
2			analysis	literary			treasure . i think that the literary analysis of this book has been adequately covered here ; this review is purely history of love is moving , thoughtful , beautifully written . this book stands out in a way that inspires me to share it , and i keep several copies on hand to give away when people ask for book recommendations . nicole krauss please publish another novel soon . the wait is arduous .
1			head	entire	one	new	head	black			don not over cook ! i had just received this garlic roaster and couldn not wait to try it . i followed the directions and instead of putting in in the microwave for 5 -6 minutes , i put it in for only 4 minutes . the smoke started pouring out of the microwave vent and the entire head of garlic was coal black and the roaster was ruined . a friend told me to try only 1 1 2 minutes and , although the roaster now has a burnt smell , i tried it for that time only . the garlic turned out soft and usable , except i will now have to replace the roaster with a new one . whoever wrote the directions couldn not have been further off with the timing . just be careful ! i would probably cut down the oven time to 30 minutes instead of the recommended time , also .
1			book	basic	book	good			what it does , it does well . however , it falls way short . this book is good in how it presents the information it does . however , it falls way short of teaching enough . it is a basic book at be st if you are just starting out in cbt , then this book is for you . if you have done any cbt before , then don not bother . and if you are experienced with authorware and want more on odbc , cmi , or ko looking .
1			looked	awful			not at all as pictured . i ordered the brown color expecting a light brown leather sandal . i received a mud brown , almost maroon swede sandal that looked awful . the tag matched the style and color here , so i am not sure what the deal is .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			sticks to the plot , but horribly adapted , with worse music . put quite simply this adaption does not even come close to feeling like something from tolkien . i will admit , the animation isn not bad although not really what i pictured when i first read the hobbit , but if the creators felt they had to dumb down the dialouge as much as they did to appeal to a younger audience then they shouldn not have even bothered , and just let the book speak for itself . i can see where a five or six year old would enjoy this , and if it gets them into tolkien , all the better i guess . but for anyone looking for a deep , faithful adaption of even the most simple book concerning middle earth avoid this movie
1			st	difficult	outline	detailed	outline	solid			betz is lacking . although the betz guide presents a well thought out study plan with a detailed outline of topics to be covered , it lacks any substantial test preparation material . the practice problems are few in number , and 5 10 of them contain an error of some kind , those are just the ones i caught . while the betz guide gives a solid outline of items to study , it doesn not provide the summarized material it outlines . i already know what is on the dat and i can easily come up with a study outline myself . what i need is a study guide that provides me with the information to master the te st bottom line , the betz guide is a terse and abbreviated study aid for an in depth and difficult te st in other words , it is a waste of money . they need to hire a better editor and a few more authors who can tell us what we need to know .
2			cd	great			great . i think this was a great cd my favorites are brass monkey , 3 mc's and one dj this is a great cd no matter what type rap / rock beasties
1			fue	horrible			gran historia , editado de manera horrible . esta novela me gusto mucho , porque era una historia , en la que no hubo villanos solo situaciones en las que personas tienen que enfrentar . una mujer abandonada por su esposo por otra y encuentra una 2 a oportunidad en un joven 16 anos menor que edicion en esta novela fue tan horrible , quien edito esta telenovela realmente no sabia lo que estaba haciendo . no s como telemundo puede vender algo de tan baja calidad . en esta telenovela tantos conflictos fueron editados , como por ejemplo el conflicto de jeronimo y su hijo que no acepta a victoria , el conflicto del la compaera de trabajo de jeronimo que le desarrolla una atraccin fatal por tambin la discusin entre la otra y victoria , el cual es un momento climtico en la novela y , en fin , los problemas de la hija mayor de victoria . este dvd fue tan mal editado que no recomendara que lo compraran .

2			it	funny	songs	great			boy oh boy . i first heard g . i . josephine live here in atlanta ga . when george was on tour promoting his cheapness and beauty cd . the song is about gays in the military and george said he wrote it on the bus while touring about the time the big don not ask don not tell going on . it was funny and of course in your face . i picked up this album because of that song and the fact that im sure i would find more on this that i liked . there are 2 songs that i always skip to when i put this cd in the player . a track called in maya and another called broken spirit . if you are a avid boy george fan then you dont want to miss keepin these great songs from your bad they will never get released commercially they remind me of songs i would be listening to for years to come . 2 classics . check this out !
2			music	good	characters	main			this is a fun movie . i thought the music was very good . student characters were well developed as were the main adult characters coming back . this is a movie fun , but not deep .
1			sense	common	plastic	weak	office	heavy	usage	high	motor	strong	volume	small	motor	extra	sense	good	motor	heavy	motor	good	sharpener	effective			sharpens well but poorly designed . likes good , strong , extra heavy duty motor makes sharpening pencils a breeze . designed for daily continuous usage . intended for office use . pencilsaver prevents over sharpening and waste . auto reset to prevent motor burnout . relatively quiet . dislikes very small / volume challenged shavings receptacle / tray . only one standard sized opening for 2 pencils . shavings tray is part of the front cover ; the weak plastic may not withstand repeated removal / reinstallation . $ 50.29 for this ? long term durability ? bottom line lots of promises but failed to deliver on some crucial points a high usage , heavy duty office pencil sharpener should have a much bigger shavings tray . repeated emptying of the puny shavings tray may weaken / damage the weak plastic and attachment points . it doesn not require a rocket scientist to design an effective pencil sharpener ; just good common sense !
1			i	disappointed	duty	heavy no	mixer	old	replacement	free			turbo beater failed . i bought this mixer and only used it a couple of times for routine not heavy duty mixing . the turbo beater broke shortly after a year the wire came loose where it attaches at the top . i called the company expecting a free replacement and was told that i had to buy it you need to buy 2 for $ 19 includinf shipping . i was so dissapointed that i put the old ge hand mixer back into service after more than 30 years of use without a problem . i think that the turbo beater design is not robust enough and can fail very easily .
1			stylus	flimsy			worthless . this pen does not change easily at all . you have toline up this then push that then ull get the point you want . the stylus is flimsy . i agree with denis , im sending this back and shopping around for a much better one .

1			bulk	extra	part	worst	description	good	condition	poor			book in poor condition . there's a reason i picked this product . it wasn not the cheapest on the list but the description was good . i received the book and it has an extra bulk to it because of excessive use of stickies . the worst part of it all is that it cannot be removed and it's making the book lopsided . if i would known this , i would have just bought the cheapest out of the li st
1			grinder	awesome	texture	nice	money	extra	it	expensive	pasta	fresh	it	worth	attachment	traditional	texture	necessary			don not waste your money . even if you already own the food grinder don not waste your money on the pasta attachment . since this is more of an extrusion pasta maker , the pasta does not get the nice thin texture that is necessary in fresh pasta . i made lasagna noodles from this attachment and had to roll out every noodle by hand after it had been extruded because it wasn not thin you love fresh pasta , as i do , you would be better off buying the actual stainless steel , traditional pasta roller attachment for your kitchen aid . it is more expensive , but well worth the extra money . i use this attachment all the time and always get the results that i am looking for . when my husband purchased the pasta attachment it came as a set with the food grinder . the food grinder is awesome .
1			kreiger	good	doors	good	things	new	densmore	good	drummer	new			glazed and shrunken . god , this was like a really good doors tribute band , but on an off night . ray's keyboards sound really thin and the new drummer just doesn not get the vibe that densmore was so good at capturing . kreiger is pretty good , but looks ancient on stage . ian ashbury is no jim morrison and having someone up there looking like him and partly sounding like him only makes you miss morrison all the this if you just like new things , but otherwise , its not the doors .
2			insight	valuable	i	amazed	source	valuable			a valuable source of inspiration for all of us . this book serves as an inspiration to anyone who wants more . there are plenty of us who haven not yet begun the journey towards our drea ms let this inspirational book be your first stepi underlined a lot in this book , and going back to read just my underlines i am amazed at the amount of loving , valuable insight in this book . growing and truly accepting responsibility for the quality of our lives is not as easy as it sounds . michael levine gives a lot of valuable insight and support to help us all stay on course .
1			viewpoint	personal	guys	bad			seemed only to promote author's agenda . i kept thinking all the way through that this book would let up on trashing the conservative viewpoint . maybe because i tend to be conservative , it bothered me more than it would the liberals . all the way through the author didn not seem to miss a chance to put another dig in . it pretty much ruined the story for me . i agree the bad guys were unbelievably bad . this is my first kate wilhelm book and will probably be my la st i don not know if she uses all her books as the vehicle for her personal viewpoint . also i couldn not get into barbara holloway's personality and character enough to cheer for her during the trial .
1			summaries	short	room	enormous	me	critical			could have been better . a mediocre treatment of a terrific subject . the capsule summaries have to be short , or they wouldn not be capsules but too often they fall flat , barely catching the essence of the film . calling this book an illustrated guide is stretching the truth almost to the point of breaking . the illustrations are sparse , and aren not even from the cartoons themselves , but from advertisements for the really pains me to be critical of the work , but there is enormous room for improvement . raving over it might well discourage another author or even the originals from producing a better work .
2			book	good			the hanson book . i think it was a really good book . i tgave alot of info on my fav band and i really enjoyed reading it ! hanson rox ! ! ! ! i love zac ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

2			portayal	natural	classic	true	mother	dead	relationship	adorable	friend	best			thomas j and vada ; together forever . a well rounded movie evocative of nostalgia , it is sure to melt your heart . we are given a glimpse into innocence that once was . anna chlumsky's flawless , natural , honest and mature portayal of the character vada sultenfuss is nothing less than perfect and oscar worthy . the movie is basically an intimate invitation to witness one eventful summer in vada's life . it's about her relationship with her father and dead mother , her crush on mr bixley , her relationship with the cosmetologist who comes into their lives , her hypochondria and above all her adorable relationship with her best friend ; thomas j sennett . this movie is vada's naive yet insightful perception of life and death . there is this one scene which brings tears to my eyes every single time i see it . and this one poem which breaks my heart everytime i hear it . i m writing this review wishing i could give this movie ten stars instead . definitely , one of my all time favourites . a true classic .
1			it	good no	anything	bad	she	bad	everett	fine	nothing	new	places	familiar			really just so so . i have watched this movie twice , and i am not sure i will watch it again . first of all , i m one who had never had anything bad to say about madonna's acting , but here she's really bad . she gets better and the movie progresses , it's almost distracting , because she's supposed to be the center of the attention . rupert everett is fine , he looks dashing of course , like benjamin then , the movie itself is really badly done . they had the locations , the sets , and yet it's just not at all good and almost boring at times , not to mention the familiar places we have been at before and the really annoying court scenes . just how many times do we have to see attorneys trashing innocent people ? honestly , there is nothing new in this movie to make it worth watching more than once to convince yourself how not good it is .

1			techniques	simple	rubbish	complete	one	long	garbage	complete	success	regular			complete rubbish . we bought this book when we were expecting our first child . the claims it made to being the fool proof method of calming a crying baby and ensuring sleep filled nights were very appealing . i have two points to make . first , the techniques it discusses are very simple and can be learnt in less than five minutes . in fact they are widely described in many books and websites on babies . there is no neeed to buy a book specifically to learn these techniques least of all this one which is very long but starts repeating itself after the introduction . secondly , i can now say from experience there is absolutely no calming technique that is going to work night after night . sure , we have tried the ones in this book and sometimes they work . but often they don not . please don not be fooled as we were into believing the author's claims of instant and regular success this is complete garbage which is where this book belongs .
2			growth	new			unique and indispensable . the go to product to prevent transplant shock in shrubs , saplings , and plants . not widely available in most nurseries , where you can find many brands of rooting powders for preparing cuttings , but not usually this vitamin b 1 product to establish new root growth in transplants . a bottle of hormex last lasts a long time , because only a very dilute solution is needed .
1			seed	good			don not waste your money . this feeder seems to be well made and really sticks securely to the window . however , only two birds at a time can eat from it . i bought good seed to attract cardinals and other colorful song birds . for several days , no birds came at all . nothing but some kind of brown birds ever came around and then only lit on it and flew off without eating .
1			buy	great	luck	good			disappointed . love the batali line , but very disappointed with this tool . design is flawed with the edge of the turner too flexible and with the heat of pan becomes nearly un usable . only using for fish as named , and far to flimsy . good luck , but not a great buy .

2			way	good			sounds like a roller rink but in a good way . i really like lrd's remix of cassius's song feeling for you and this cd is the same style . it does have eighties style digitized rythm and i think its sneaky for him to pose as a french guy though maybe thats those badboys at astralwerks but its a cool disc . you could definitely do worse . also , it is consistent . so if you like a song you heard somewhere by him , you will like the album .

2			quality	good	filter	good	pictures	clear	price	great			good quality filter at great price . fits perfectly on my canon rebel t 3 kit lenses . good quality , provide clear pictures . i recommend a lens pen to clean the lens before attaching .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			do not buy it ! i buy the intex 66703 rising comfort queen airbed . imediatly used it inflate but do not hold the air . piece of trash . i order in here with backstore vitalityweb and they said no warranty , no guarantee i lost the $ 70.75 i paid with shipping could used not even one should said the no guarantee , no warranty in the same description of item not in other pages if i knew i did order it . waist of money .
2			vector	identical			la crosse xg 55 altimeter watch . owned this watch only briefly , had no problems in that short time , but did not get the reason for the backward compass you could set it so it says west when you are really facing ea st once i figured that out , i changed it back and all was right with the world . one thing to note , though the rubber watch bands on two other watches broke after less than 18 months , the second in several places . this has the same rubber as the other two . and the battery in the k 2 -100 predecessor to the xg 55 had to be replaced after only 9 months . also , the ability to enter the known sea level pressure to determine your altitude is a feature included in the xg 55 that was sorely missing on the k 2 -100 bottom line they fixed a couple of deficiencies since the k 2 -100 and it costs half the price of the nearly identical suunto vector their cheapest watch with a compass and an altimeter .
1			i	worst	i	stupid	plot	stupid	movies	worst			sucks ! one of the worst i have ever seen . this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i shut it off acting , stupid plot , boring , trash , etc too much whining and of the female characters were stupid and annoying ! grow up !
1			movie	scary	pepole	good	movie	good			all this was is a spoof . i love the brady bunch i see it all the time on tv land then i shall this movie i that it was post to be based on the tv show it was not all it was is just a movie that is making fun of the brady bunch its just another spoof movie like scary movie or airplane why did they call this movie the brady bunch if it was a spoof of it if you like the brady bunch then dont see this it is just a spoof and making fun of good pepole trust me its not worth it in les you are looking for a good spoof movie .
1			book	worth no	day	modern			sparks best . in the summer of 32 noah and allie meet and quickly fall head over heels in love . but somehow , at the end of the summer , the two are separated and lose contact . after 14 years they meet again . will their love overcome the barriers between the two . you betcha . and it's all rather touching , even overwrought at times . so far nothing new , and , indeed , from my perspective nothing last portion of the book , however , fast forwards to the modern day . our protaganists have now aged and one is in the grips of alzheimer's . the love story continues . this portion of the book too is sacharine . it is not nearly so hackneyed , though , in my opinion , this book is not worth reading , it is by far sparks best and the only of his novels that displays any inventiveness .
2			guilder	real	places	real	books	best			one of the best books ever written . i have seen the movie so many times i lost count . i can almost act out the whole thing . so when my cousin let me borrow the paperback copy of the book which she first read in her novels class , i gladly took it and read it . i loved so much that when i saw the 25 h anniversary edition , i bought it even before i had finished the reading the one she gave me . goldman does an excellant job of making you believe that morgenstern is a real person , florin and guilder are real places , and that there is an unabridged version . i just wish he would finish buttercup's baby . i can not wait to see what happens in it ! i loved this book so much that i am buying copies to give to friends and family . if you liked the movie , you will love the book .
2			it	cultural	locations	main	sistah	real	novel	next			meet the author she is a real sistah . i had the pleasure of meeting lolita @ the house of africa tunde dada woodbrige center mall , woodbridge , n . j . in january 1998 if readers are ever in the area you should definitely stop by or the orange , n . j . main st , locations also in n . y . it's so cultural and makes you feel a sense of pride . i felt like lolita was a friend she was so down to earth and very genuine . she was very appreciative of all the support her readers have given her . i m definetely looking forward to her next novel .
2			value	new	service	great			awesome . i bought a pink floyd album and it was the newly remastered version . i found it for a lesser value , brand new and receive it quickly . talking about great customer service !
1			product	happy no			boken . i recieved these boken and one was cracked . the wrapps came off the first day i used them at the dojo . i would not order these again very unhappy with this product .
2			cast	strong	dvd	great	chemistry	great	movies	classic			cult classic ! excellent movie with a strong cast ! i watched this movie countless times on cable growing up and fell in love with the story and of course the action packed content . watching this movie many years later i find it is still one of the better classic war movies . great chemistry with richard burton , roger moore , and richard harris . the dvd is great and has a number of behind the scenes interviews and videos which really adds to the nostalgia of this classic !
1			book	specific	one	expensive			too expensive ! this is just a book for beginners and doesn not offer anything more than other french books that are written for the same you have a choice of buying a cheaper book , go for that . the price does not necessarily mean that the book is better . however , it might mean that your instructor has got some incentives to ask you buy this specific book and not a less expensive one .
1			reproduction	poor	variables	entire	text	difficult			poor reproduction . often the text is difficult or impossible to read . in some of the equations , entire variables are illegible . a different edition would probably be a better choice .
2			improvement	nice	it	great	filter	great			great replacement filter . we have had the holmes whole house humidifier for several years now , and aside from having to replace filters each season , it's great ! this filter is no exception it is just like the one that came with the humidifier , and so far , has made a nice improvement in our air quality this winter .
2			bea	high	products	good			nipples do not show , but makes my boobs its like crazy ! they fit great under the bra and do not budge . i think your own body heat makes them stick to your boobs . these definitely got rid of the high bea ms the only drawback is they make my boobs itch like crazy . i wash them regularly so it isn not like i m wearing dirty discs . if anyone has the same problem and has a solution , please let me know . other than the itching , these are good products . update 11 25 11 after using these for a few years , they have worn down a bit and have started to tear towards the middle . i do like these and they do the trick . i m ordering another pair .
1			display	good no	i	disappointed	design	worst			don not let the price fool you . i was very disappointed . first , the design is the worst among the brands . second , its display is not as good as the others also . then i try the keyboa rd when i pressed on one key , the whole keyboard goes down i have never see any laptop as inexpensively made as this one .
1			it	awesome	connection	bad	screen	black	pictures	horrible	toy	worst			worst toy in the world ! ! i wanted this toy so badly for christmas because i thought it was excactly like a cell phone ! i got it for christmas and i tried calling my friends house with didnt work ! ! then i relized you could only call people with chatnows ! ! no one i knew had chat nows because they all had cellphones ! my parents wont let me have a cell . since it came with two i decided to give one to my friend who lives 4 houses down from me ! it didnt work when i called her . the connection was bad . many times i couldnt reach her ! i thought it was going to be awesome because it could take pics . but the pictures were horrible ! most of them were just a black screen when i took it ! ! ripp off ! !
2			music	great	condition	new	i	glad	memories	great			i m glad all over . the cd was in perfect condition , brand new . i liked that it came quickly . the music was great , it brought back lots of great memories . i love it .
2			cartoons	best	it	unique			one of the best cartoons of all time . when i first saw invader zim , i couldnt believe how mindboggling hilarous and deeply disturbing it was . it was so stylistically unique and intense with emotion that i knew this was going to hit big . this was as revolutionary as ren & stimpy was when it first came out . decades later , cartoons are still copying the style of ren & stimpy . but nickleodeon totally screwed up when it came to invader zim . after bouncing it around to different timeslots , it dropped one of the best cartoons ever made . but at least this dvd exists !
2			movie	good			favorite dance movie . if you like dancing , particularly salsa , you will love this movie . it's been around for a while , but i still enjoy watching it . it also doesn not hurt that i know several of the performers . really good dance movie !
2			it	awesome	price	great	pans	contemporary	nonstick	true	spots	hot			awesome even without the great price . years ago i had club aluminum and later added farberware millenium as a nonstick option . over the years the club aluminum warped . that was replaced by copper bottom revereware . that was a disappointment as was the millenium that was never a true nonstick . it stuck bigtime . the revereware was replaced with a stainless steel triclad . it's awesome in it's cooking abilities but so is the cleaning . i was just browsing amazon when i saw the sale on calphalon contemporary omelet pans . i went for it . a bit of olive oil or smart balance or nothing , these pans don not stick . omelets ? i have sauted and fried other foods , too many to count . no hot spots . cleanup is a the answer is yes . i have purchased more calphalon contemporary .
1			complaint	biggest	cars	old	it	difficult	pictures	great			not a very satisfying purchase . the book is mostly very bland facts and figures . the intro to each model year is very brief and then goes straight into vins and paint codes . i also don not like how the options and prices are written in paragraph form instead of as a li st that makes it difficult to compare between model years . however , my biggest complaint are the book's quality control errors . there are a few spelling errors and there are no less than 10 pictures that are mislabled example a magnetic red convertible labled as an electron blue z 06 . the price guide section also inexplicably contains the header the prices listed here represent a sample of british sports cars imported to north america , taken from the 2004 old cars price guide . if you do not see your car here , check the 2005 edition of cars and prices or contact the club of your british car . there are a lot of great pictures in this book , which is its saving grace .
2			rockin	good			good rockin . i took notice of this group as they kinda sounded like a heavier version of talking the cd and lo ! they were more than that ! every cut stands on its own .
2			traveler	international			international traveler . i used the nuvi 670 in germany and found that it was very accurate in navigating in downtown areas and performed as advertised . i would highly recommend the product .
1			piece	old	production	original	effect	total	effect	visual			the music lives . i love the music of this old christmas piece , full of memories . i have listened to it on records and cds for years , but i wanted the visual effect of the opera , which i have seen onstage , live . this is a film of the original production ; uesbut sadly , the 1955 tv production values are a disappointment . i expected black and white , but the total effect is so much inferior to , say , a 1955 motion picture film . that said , the voices are splendid !
1			mystery	best			incomprehensible . one of the blurbs on the cover said not he daughter of time was the best mystery ever written . i seldom give up on a book but this is one that i discarded about a fourth of the way your money .
2			woman	nice	growl	low	album	good			did tomorrow come ? this album is pretty good , although not nearly as melodic or as . would ark as the acme release , which i understand is probably much more difficult to find , this album is overall pretty good , and a worthy addition to any metal have two masculine singers with interesting accents , one does the low growl , while the other is also low and resonating , while occasionally an very nice woman's voice you like this one , check acme for sure , that album blows this one away .
2			product	good	people	careful no			this is a good product . i was a little weary of the product because they shipped it without any protective wrap and having had worked in a post office in the past i know that people are not overly careful , but the product works well and i am enjoying it
1			they	bad	i	disappointed	language	bad	move	poor			where's the edited audio track ? i love the show , but i was very disappointed when i found out there wasn not another audio track with bleeped bad language . now i m either going to have to only watch this by myself or return it . poor move on mtv / paramount's part . even the osbournes got an edited track and they are just as bad or worse ! surely it wouldn not have been that difficult to add an edited track . had they done this , it easily would have gotten 5 stars from me . i personally don not mind bad language much , but some of the people i would have been watching this with do mind . very , very lame . and something that could have been so easily corrected !
1			advertisment	false	scam	terrible	economy	tough	account	new			ultraviolet needs to provide refunds ! the economy is tough enough without companies like this giving false advertisment . i logged into the ultraviolet website and watched the cartoon about their membership and i could feel my brain crying but i kept on . when i log in with my new account i kept looking for the redeem coupon option but there is none as log as i am logged in . this is a terrible scam !
1			i	disappointed	name	interested	it	hard			beyond boring . this is my second patricia cornwell book , also my la st kay isa totally unlikeable character . she is self involved , arrogant , humourless , and totally one dimensional . i could never understand why benton hate that name would be interested in her . i agree with everyone else's reviews on the gigantic plot i find it very hard to believe that a me would get so involved in every case in the state . i have never heard of a criminal blaming the me and then going after her . i kept reading just to finish it and was so disappointed i said never again .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			damaged . i received my order and the hinges and or casings for 3 or the 5 seasons were damaged . i could see one , but three ? since i couldn not return the damaged ones . i returned them all . i may re order . i don not know .
1			term	local	tree	little	service	valuable	account	true	it	good	tv	good	credibility	complete	writing	exceptional			over rated & 65533 ok book , but not deserving of the praise . i found this book to be quite over rated . the writing was simplistic and lacking in depth . many people consider hemingway's writing style simplistic , but there was depth of meaning beneath his unadorned manner of writing . oprah has performed a valuable service for the public by encouraging reading through her book club . however , this book is like a good tv show . it may be good , but in the end it's still only tv . also , i have a problem with the accuracy of the author's depiction of turn of the century appalachia . he displays some knowledge of the area poke is a local term for sack or bag , but i felt overall many details were suspect and lacking in complete credibility . for readers seeking a touching and more accurate picture of the time and locale , i suggest the education of little tree by forrest carter . his account is true and the writing is exceptional , in a sublime way . it was a 1991 abby award recipient .
2			seem	exciting	movie	good			batman ! batman ! batman ! my first childhood superhero . adam west and burt ward make the movie seem much more exciting than the tv show . frank goshin , burgess merideth , ceasar romero , lee merwither and the support cast of madge blake , alan napier , neill hamilton , and stafford repp make this a good family movie .
2			book	outstanding			an outstanding book for achieving your goals ! i found that anatomy of success plots a very exacting formula that , unlike anything else i have ever read , gets to the heart of most all areas about which we think and act , in an extremely organized fashion . this helps with regard to empowering our beliefs , managing our time , building self confidence and self awareness , etc these are especially useful in helping us to turn our dreams into realities ; the foundation on which my business is based .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			i don not get it . what's all the fuss all about ? this is one of the most boring books i ever couldn not finish . the only thing going for it is a catchy title .
2			animals	great	animal	entire	pictures	realistic	we	concerned			great animals . we really like these animal magnets for our daughter , and she loves them too . the magnet covers the entire animal , so no concern with it not sticking to the fridge . also , the pictures are more realistic instead of cartoonish . the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because a few of the animals are small , and we were concerned they may be a choking hazard for our 1 year old . also , the magnets are wood with the animal picture glued to the front . if your child likes to put everything in their mouth like ours does , or if these get wet dropped in the dog's water bowl , then it will mess up the picture of the animal .
2			it	hard	workout	total			yoga booty ballet . my wife has lost a total of 12 lbs after eating better and starting yoga booty ballet . she has become more tone and energetic . she likes the way that it combines cardio , ballet , yoga and weights in one package . it is definitely a total body workout . at first it is hard to catch on at the pace they things but eventually you get it .
1			machines	superior	machines	big	son	old	shots	good			to much face time with dave . my two year old son loves tractors and construction equipment . unfortunately , the narrator's attempt of being funny becomes lengthy and irritating . there are some good equipment shots but fred levine's road construction ahead and sandbox video's big construction machines are superior , in my opinion , to this video . not oo much time watching someone talk and act funny and not enough time spent on the equipment .
2			state	married	levels	various			on the beach a disturbing prediction . as a child of the 50 and 60 , i found the book very most powerful thing in this novel is its immediacy to our own exist in an age when nuclear warfare is an immediate possibility . i was touched by the captain's insistence on thinking of his family in the present tense , and refusal of the woman , moira's advances , in deference to his obviously married state despite his awareness of the reality , the captain continues to think of them as he left them . as a person who , as a child in the 60 , learned to jump under my desk in school , during air raid drills , i was profoundly affected by this story . furthermore , i was very moved by this author's vision of how people might hold on to hope , at the same time that they accept , on various levels , the inevitability of destruction . i have read thousands of books in my lifetime , most of which i recall only slightly . i will never forget this book .
2			it	easy			easy to use book to re learn algebra . as an adult i am going back to college , and bought this book to study and try to test out of lower level algebra classes . so far it has been very easy to re learn everything using this book . brief lessons explain everything very well with plenty of examples and problems to try for yourself . most of the answers in the back of the book show their work too , so you can easily identify when and where you went wrong .
2			story	great			great story and illustrations ! i shared this book with my three grandchildren , twins ages 5 and age 3 . it was a mega hit . i also teach at a university and will share this book with our children's literature faculty !
2			son	old	gloves	good	quality	good			harbinger power strech goves . good gloves for the price i paid . good quality for my 20 year old son . i would recommend it . i have boughtg a few from other dealers but they broke fa st
2			machine	good	ears	little			to infinity and beyond . this is a good lil machine for the price i got it for me especially , but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too . those little bunny ears work freakin wonders ! ! i never climaxed so quickly . i don not really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny you combine watch out ; i would buy this again if i had is my favorite toy so far .
2			brand	expensive	price	affordable	nutrients	comparable	chapter	new	affordable	reasonable			easy on the stomach ! i like the nutrients derived from food based sources and only the need to take the vitamin only once a day , which is easier and more manageable for me to follow and not having to keep track . i also like another more expensive brand like new chapter perfect prenatal , which is also food based , however i would have to take 3 pills a day to get the daily dose , which i often missed with a busy schedule . so for more reasonable and affordable price , convenience , and comparable nutrients , i prefer and have been using rainbow light just once prenatal for the last two years .
2			movie	great	movie	good	movie	entertaining	it	entertaining			great action movie ! even though this movie was made on 7 000 it is just as entertaining as these million dollar movies out there ! this movie to me was more entertaining than titanic ever could be ! and the action sequences a great ! anyway if you are looking for a good action movie this is your movie !
1			series	entire			incomplete . this dvd is a recap of a series when they could have put together the entire series and charged 29.99 per and made more $ and made customers happier . but most notable is that the very deserving winner , j . d . fortune , who's rock star looks and style as well as his perfect vocals , had actually developed in front of the camera during this series . from his interpretation of california dreaming , to his leaving his team to write the 1 single pretty vegas 1 in canada by series is a chronicle of the making of one of music's newest stars , and burnett and his series can take the credit . but he should share this with the many fans that will want to see it for themelves .
1			conscience	good	women	hot	effects	special	i	bored	fi	average			schlock . below average sci fi schlock . despite decent special effects , i was bored to tears . silly plot , stale love scenes , no hot women , no car chases , etc , etc unless the actors worked for free , they were vastly overpaid . i just bought this movie for $ 5 and i feel ripped off . in good conscience , i can not even recommend renting this pos .
2			home	new			watership down ; thumbs up . if you liked the trilogy of the rings , you will love this adventure about bunnies yes bunnies , get use to it searching for a new home . my brother almost didn not read it because he thought a novel about bunnies was the stupidest thing he ever heard , but after the first chapter , was was pro bunny all the way .
2			it	clear	book	easy	book	great			great book . the book doesn not have much stuff that i haven not seen before , but she definitely makes it very clear how to focus on that part of your body . i love the information on it . it's clear cut , simple and the book is very easy to read . i got that one and the eat clean diet and love them both .
2			it	wonderful	set	great	series	regular			great set ! if you loved the series , it is wonderful to have some laughs at your fingertips ! this is the full regular season series .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			you call this a massager ? i purchased this mat for a birthday gift for my husband . we took it out turned it on and laid on it . yeah , it heats up and vibrates . yet massage is not what you get . it's gives the same feeling you have when you get finished mowing the lawn on the riding lawn mower . your sort of numb , but you don not feel anymore relaxed or massaged .
1			windows	bad	it	cheap	bios	new	days	happy	door	great			why lance why ? i can not believe lance loaned his name out to such an inferior product . i bought this laptop because it was fairly cheap and did what i needed it to in order to do school work . apparently i didn not need this hunk of junk to actually boot up . when i first got the laptop every other time i turned it on i would receive kernel errors and have to reboot the computer and wait about 30 minutes while it ran a scandisk . after a while i got fed up and re installed things started happenning . contact hp support via internet of course because i could never find their help number and they had me flash the motherboard with a new bios . did that and laptop worked great for about a week . i decided windows was bad so i installed a linux based os . which worked great . until i left it unplugged for a laptop is giving me more errors . oh happy days . laptop makes a great door stop though .
1			story	good no			annoying , depressing , no plot . classics come and classics go , and this classic should never have been . a man going through a depressive time in his life is not a good story unless his depression brings about side stories , as does occur in invisible man by ralph ellison . this book seems to go nowhere leaving the reader to continue to hope for the expected conflict that never transpires . not he catcher in the rye is quite a disappointment .
1			movie	great	features	special	mistake	horrible	ray	horrible			great movie , horrible blu ray . i enjoy this movie , and decided to get the blu ray instead of the criterion edition . this was a horrible mistake . the blu ray has no special features , not even a commentary the criterion has 3 . i will be purchasing the criterion edition sometime in the future .
2			story	great	edition	original	friends	young	story	beautiful	children	modern	edition	new	it	beautiful			great story , though not the original . i have the original 1923 edition of the wind boy , and it is my favorite book of all time . sheer poetry , with a timeless message of grace and redemption , compassion and the healing power of creativity that will touch something deep in every child and every adult who reads it . sadly , after ww 2 the author was persuaded to modernize some of the language for a new edition , perhaps thinking that modern children would not be able to relate to words like porridge . the changes are not an improvement . but the story is still beautiful , and several of my young friends have read and enjoyed you can find and afford the original , by all means , buy it . if not , buy this one ; it is too beautiful a story to pass up .
2			customer	pleased	colors	good	way	good	fabric	good			very pleased customer . my husband asked me to send this is very very pleased with these bill blass shirts . comfortable , good colors , wash does not understand the comments about thin is a good weight fabric and not too the collar stays are permanently sewn into colllar instead of the removable type . why id this a problem ? this way they do not get these shirts are good .
1			i	disappointed	form	current	waste	total	writing	poor			soap operatic saga full of caricatures . i just finished this book , and i am hugely disappointed . the book could have been condensed down to a third of it's current form . there are ramblings that go on for pages that repeat information that just felt like page fillers . it seems like no editing had been done for this book . clavell tortures us with poor writing , shallow characters , and caricaturization of all chinese characters and especially completely distorted view and depiction of all women in the book . perhaps mr clavell suffered from seeing all women as virgins or whores . a total waste of time .
1			width	large	it	large	it	big	you	short	hole	small	size	large	guy	average	length	short	sleeves	large			okay sweatshirt if you are short and fat . i am an average size guy , about 5 10 165 lbs . i ordered a size large of this sweatshirt . the length of it is too short after washing it , it barely reaches the bottom of my belt in the back . and the sleeves and width are too large . i think the sleeves are large enough to fit my thighs . and it is big enough around to fit two of my torso but not two necks , since the neck hole is pretty small . i have another hooded sweatshirt from a brand sold on amazon . it is a size large , and the proportions are more , the first time i washed this sweatshirt , the stitching around the pocket started unraveling . pretty lame .
2			i	pleased	i	excited			soniarene . i was so excited when i found this funny show . it's also a fond memory of mine . my husband and i laughed when we found this online . we knew we had to have it . and i was very pleased when it was delivered at a prompt time . thank you .
1			one	good	i	excited			almost doa . broke right away . i was excited to be able to plug everything in without a car adapter . but this stopped working within a month of buying it . i had a close look at it and some of the wires weren not connected all the way , as if they would been yanked out or as i m sure is the case never assembled correctly to begin with . at the same time as i say don not buy it , i m not sure which one is good because i never tried a different one .
2			he	good	thing	good	actors	good	aetius	general	movie	good	it	entertaining			attila review . this movie is a very sweeping story of attila . i never realized attila went to rome , but i know now . i don not know how historically correct this movie is , but it is very entertaining . lots of beautiful scenery , lots of action , good actors , lots of stuff to keep you entertained . i have watched it more than once . powers boothe as roman general flavius aetius was a good thing , he was good . all in all , i would say a good movie .
1			i	happy no			a dictionary of the otchipwe language . i am not happy with this publication . i wanted to send it back but could not find the shipping document . some of it is illegible as it is just photo copied from an original . thank you for allowing me the opportunity to give a review .
1			song	good	cd	entire			definately not the greatest . although i have only listened to the cd , i found this set to be a waste of money . amy lee's voice is far from being on key during the early tracks of the cd . also , the cd was poorly recorded with the crowd screams often drowning out the only part of this cd i found worthwhile was the studio track at the end , missing . a very good song , but hardly able to justify the entire cd .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not pleased . pulled out of the plastic bag . felt the quality and quickly sent it back . you can find better for the price .
2			pants	long			pretty good , a little thin . i am 5 8 with really long legs and these pants were plenty long . the thigh part is pretty snug down to the knee . i have athletic thighs and these are tight , but they aren not uncomfortable tight because they are a thin material . i would buy them again for the length . as for how they will hold up that remains to be seen .
2			cd	great			my lady just loves it . great cd . nice romantic music , especially good for romantic dinner and slow dance . my lady just loves it !
2			demand	popular	love	dramatic	hit	huge	album	best			bee gees best album of the 1960 and beyond . i had this album on vinyl back in the late 60 . i loved it then and my opinion hasn not changed with the cd version . beginning with the delicate but dramatic let there be love , this is a remarkably diverse album , with stunning tracks throughout . i started a joke started out as merely an album cut , but was released as a single by popular demand . of course , the huge hit i have gotta get a message to you stands out , but by no means overshadows the re st of their four pre breakup lps , idea is the strongest overall . as a bonus , this contains such a shame vince's track which was deleted from the us lp such a shame , indeed !
2			stories	popular	one	next	story	great			great story , as good as the first book . i can see why these charming stories are so popular . jk rowling really keeps you riveted . can wait to read the next one !
2			album	great	album	entire			wow ! you gotta hear this ! this entire album is great ! in particular , the chant of the islands is a breathtaking song . its what paradise sounds yourself a favor and purchase this album .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			mind and spirit . this well written book brings insight into how a mind can be renewed by god's holy spirit . superb and transformational reading !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			shakira es mi cantante favorita . i speak english and i have 5 years of spanish . i love her music and ever since my friend tuti told me to buy her cd , i have been hooked . ciega , sordomuda is an awesome song . no creo is one of my favorite songs , she can really sing and write . when i looked at the writers of the songs on my ricky martin cd , i was laughing because all he is , is an icon . he can sing and dance , shakira actually has talent .
2			copies	separate	people	real	it	incredible			a classic . a friend of mine loaned me separate copies of shards of honor and barrayar , then ended up buying me the two in one edition because i was so reluctant to give them back . since then i have re read it until it is falling apart . there's no higher praise i can give a book than that . cordelia's honor is one of those books that alters your worldview , changes your life , and sits on your top shelf forevermore . it's a love story but it's a lot more than that . it's the story of how two determined people from very different backgrounds meet , fall in love and go on to change their worlds for the better . cordelia and aral become like real people you actually know better still , they become your friends . if you haven not read this story , you don not know what you are missing it is incredible .
2			rock	southern	playing	great	album	good			could be my all time favorite . it's all here theme , great playing and singing . if you have access to or own it , it's a good album to crank up while on the road . equally good to fire one up , kick back and , pure prairie league and mcguffey lane are country rock . don not confuse them with southern rock .
1			horsey	soft			soft horsey . well it works decent enough but its a little cheap . the metal easily bends . but then again what do you expect for so cheap ? ?
1			it	nice	buy	best	problem	serious	lamp	new			serious lamp problem . i bought this scanner from best buy and it worked great for a couple of months . i really don not use it all the often , but it's nice to have it when i need it . after a couple of months , the lamp crapped out . sent it back to microtek the only way to get the lamp replaced and they installed a new lamp and sent it back . everything was okay again . until . another couple of months have passed and now the lamp is out again . if i send it back for repair again , i will almost have paid as much in shipping costs as i paid for the scanner . not a reccomended purchase for anyone .
2			it	hate	elinora	like	it	good	part	worst	job	good	part	best	things	important			the staircase` . i liked this book . it was pretty good with all the important things . one thing bad about it though , is that it stayed on the same level . i don not really think there was a climax . but i did like the story . i would say that the best part of the book is when the bishops arrives . his so nice , and he knows what elinora is really like , because she fool alot of people . the worst part , well its not really the book , but more what happens in the story . i hate it when elinora stabs cleo the kitten in the eyes with a needle then throws her out the window . she doesn not need to hurt cleo to show lizzy how much she hates author did a really good job on characters , i really felt i knew them all like i had really known them for years . the other thing is the conflict , she had like five conflicts going on at the same time . so those were all pretty good .
1			story	great	story	good	pedigree	impressive	cast	impressive	it	bad	it	worth			not very good at all , despite the impressive pedigree . i would never heard of this film , but given the impressive cast and crew involved richard attenborough , for pete's sake ? speaking of petes , pete postelwaithe is here , too ! i thought it might be worth a go . and while the cast and crew do a serviceable job for the most part ranging anywhere from great to poor , it's the script that really kills this one . more specifically , the dialogue . there is a good story somewhere in here maybe a great story , but the words actually spoken are quite often so trite , cliched and cornball that not even such magnificent actors as christopher plummer and shirley maclaine can overcome it . sounds harsh , i know , but it really is that bad , particularly during the wartime flashbacks , which are painfully cheesy . i only sat through the movie to see how it wrapped up and how all the connections worked and everything , but even the ending is underwhelming .
1			it	interesting			not what i expected . i read only a few pages and did not find it all that interesting . it was more history than action .
2			power	personal	principles	new	influence	tremendous			admirable ! based on her theosophic and new thought principles , these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence . truly a most inspirational woman !
2			material	excellent	music	best			gorgeous where is the cd ! there is a conspiracy to suppress the best music by not issuing it on cd , forcing everyone to buy into the miserable , compressed , badly distorted and overloading mp 3 format suited for screechy earbuds jammed in tin ears . here is an example . i found a near mint lp by searching elsewhere , so bleep the headachy bozo format . material is excellent , however .
2			lens	nice	i	glad	price	low			very nice macro lens . don not let the low price fool you , this is a well made macro lens . i m glad i purchased it .
2			realism	magical	school	senior	school	high			like water for chocolate book review . i am a senior at walla walla high school . in my english class i was assigned to read a book for a lit . circle . i chose like water for chocolate . i really enjoyed this book and loved the magical realism the author chose to use in this book . i thought that for the most part the book was well written . the only part that i didn not like was how the author didn not make it clear whether you had just read about one year , or 30 years . over all i thought it was an excellent book and i would recommend it to anyone who likes to use their imagination . however this book is mostly for females .
2			design	graphic			yay , no second guessing ! this is just about the perfect graphic design program for the non professional or the professional who needs help occasionally . it provides the tools and a few templates just in case but lets you do the design work all the way . it is like a streamlined version of ms publisher . love it .
1			quality	poor	windshield	entire			not jumbo . this was supposed to be a jumbo sized windshield cover , intended to cover up larger van windows . the picture even shows a woman putting the cover on her van window . when we got it , we tried it on the van and it did not cover any more than the standard windshield cover we already had . comparing the size to our standard cover , it was a hair larger , but it still did not cover the entire windshield as described . also the quality was poor . i could have just bought a piece of plastic tarp and cut it to fit the windshield and i would have had something better . i returned it to amazon .
2			cast	huge			a wonderful retelling . this movie gives you an idea of the scale of these events . the movie captured everything , even details that many text books choose to leave out . the action seems like it was torn right out of a signal corps camara and the plot and huge cast stay true to the pa st this is a classic with a fairly well done transfer to dvd . it is a must for any history buff or war movie fan .
2			page	real	secrets	scary	he	crazy	tradegy	horrible	feel	sorry	kids	poor			mesmerizing . i could not put down this book ! i was mesmerized by it ! full of secrets and surprises , it was a real page turner . some of first thoughts of reading this were , my god , these poor kids raising themselves but then it went deeper . mental illness , incest , infidelity , its all in this book . i couldn not help but feel sorry for harley , becoming a man , a father , and dealing with a horrible tradegy all at once . it's no wonder he was crazy ! i think of the time that had passed until all of these secrets came to light . its scary to think how long a person can keep secrets , tradegies , buried until they really start effecting your life . it makes me realize how important closure is in my own life .
2			it	informative			420 nation , recommendation . it's funny , informative , and it's about marijuana . i have learned more aspects of marijuana in this movie , than my experience of using marijuana .
2			movie	best			baseketball is the best movie ever made . many of you by now are probably thinking , how can a silly comedy be the best movie ever made ? well it can , and baseketball is proof ! this is the funniest movie i have ever seen , having all different kinds of humor from immature sex jokes to dancing football players . this is a must see and trey parker and matt stone only make it better .
1			game	new	myself	anxious			so so game . i found this game to be a bit disappointing . there is a lot of dialogue to sit through and i found myself anxious to begin some game play . i also needed to download a patch in order for the game to stop locking up during play . in addition , there seems to be a glitch in loading a saved game . i need to start a new game and load from there .
2			book	realistic	story	great	ending	happy	setting	excellent			very well written and appropriate for the late 1990 s . i thought that a woman's place was very well written and timely . one of delinsky's few books that did not have a happy ending in the sense of all's well that ends well . its ending of compromise reflects the compromises that most of us have to make today . things don not always work out the way we want them to and we don not always do things as well as we would like . the book made me think about the changing roles of women within the family dynamic . the setting , especially the introduction of the lighthouse , was excellent and the story was riveting . the smallest details picked up the nuances of everyday family life and the book was very realistic as well as being a great story
2			character	realistic			nick hornby always has insights . this book again is a prime example of nick hornby's ability to render a realistic character and write with insight . through out this book , the character grew in engaging ways . nick hornby writes with sensitivity and insight into the human condition .
1			lip	bad			looks like bad lip syncing . i love this film but whoever synced the movie to dvd didn not notice the audio is about 2 seconds behind . painful to watch .
2			forces	natural	process	creative	artist	graphic	resistance	least			this book changed the way i live . the path of least resistance helped me truly understand the creative process , from idea to finished product . we experience these natural forces everyday and being aware makes the difference . as a musician and graphic artist , i found robert's book to be most insightful in helping me create my work and my life .
1			version	hate	i	happy no			warped cd's , unfortunately abridged . i am very unhappy with this product . although it is described as unabridged that was not the case at all . i suppose i should have known this from the fact that there were fewer cd's than other audio offerings , but i believed the description . two of the cd's were so warped they wouldn not spin in my stereo . i was extremely unhappy with this purchase . i needed to read this book for a university class . as i love literature , i would ordinarily have purchased the book , but i have had some health problems crop up unexpectedly and am having trouble with my eyes . i thought the audio book would be the way to go . so much of eliot's wonderful narrative voicing is lost in this abridged version , and the actress who reads sometimes tends to mumble . it was impossible to hear in the car . loved the book , hated this version . i listened through the end of the first disk , then had to give up as the second arrived too warped to play . completely disappointing .
2			bosses	great	bosses	horrible	performance	good	rudd	classic			gets better every time . wanderlust was a surprisingly hilarious movie . i will admit that the first time i saw it , i felt it was a decent anything . the difference with this movie as is with several others . is the more you watch funnier it gets . i noticed a lot of movies lately become cult favorites . because people watch it again and again . paul rudd is classic in this movie and jen anniston . though not as great as horrible bosses . still puts in a good performance . i purchased this movie only because i can not stop watching it ! i recommend this movie to anyone who likes hilarious dialogue and crazy situations that the characters are forced into .
1			copy	new			horribly drawn out and depressing . i like , many others extremely disliked this book . i started this book in january and put it down about after the first 200 pages and do not plan on picking up again . i refuse to subject myself to the long drawn out character development etc this could have been an excellant book but ms oates refused to tell the story , but instead subjects readers to endless pages of details that are so compeletly inconsequential that it gives me a headache to think about it . please save your money or better yet i will sell you my like new copy for a buck !
2			him	famous	one	new			the undisputed master of gothic horror . edgar allan poe is regarded as the undisputed master of the gothic horror genre . this collection contains all his published works , faithful reproductions from the orginals , that have made him famous . with stories like the the pit and the pendulum , the tell tale heart and poems like the raven , this books is a must have for any poe fan or any one who is new to poe .
2			voice	amazing			you have to get this cd . i just got this cd about 3 months ago , and i already know every word to every song , because thats how amazing it is ! everyone should buy it tyler hilton's voice is amazing ! ps visit his site too !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			great to see this film on dvd . i have always loved this film , and its great to see it on dvd at la st
2			school	high			excellent ! several years ago when i was in high school we had to read the mayor of casterbridge also by hardy . i did not enjoy it under the circumstances , but decided to give tess a try a few years later . i must say , it has certainly become one of my favorite all time books . hardy really lets the reader see and feel what is happening in the lives of the characters . i must admit that i even shed a few tears at the end something i rarely do while reading . this book is a must read for anyone who likes literature at all !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			pointless . . well , one point for effort then ! ghastly remake . an oscar for being unoriginal . totally forgettable . i have run out of superlatives .
2			twisting	anxious	writers	important	author	finest			this can be the beginning . bilge karasu was the most finest , delicate author of this intriguing turkish language . but , yet , this book is a very anxious but still twisting reading just like the reality . so , if one day , some publisher will have the idea to translate his garden of trespassed cats , then , you will find one of the most important writers of the century ; like louis rene des forets . and others . destined to be unknown of course .
2			songs	best			it rocks ! an above average metal mix . i vastly prefer this soundtrack to the bride of chucky soundtrack . the best songs are by dee snider , system of a down , kid rock with eminem and bile .
1			thing	terrible			it was a so terrible thing ! what did i order . i have ordered a front bike basket . but i have got a disk pad . what's wrong with me ? what are the sellers thinking they are sending some things . i don not understand it . i would wanted to save my time . so i would ordered through online the way they have made me waste my time . i will never order things through this !
2			daughter	old	cd	great			love it ! our 6 1 2 yr old daughter is an indigo child & has some behavior and impulse problems and this cd manages to soothe her . i absolutely love it ! i love that it teaches self soothing , and chakra meditation . and that it helps build children's self esteem in these uncertain times . it is relaxing for the whole family . we have all benefited from this cd . kudos to lori lite and all involved in the production of this great cd ! ! i highly recommend it to anyone with children !
2			i	happy			a well told story . this story was pretty well told . i think it could have been better . i was happy to see that dragons were not always red or green in this story because several storys of the middle ages record dragons as gold bronze brown dragons blue and green and black and white dragons were thought to be seen and recorded .
2			us	funny	read	great	pup	old	we	sorry	something	new			ella in europe a great read ! ella in europe is a terrific adventure us dog lovers would look to is funny and sad , goofy and inspirational and best of all , makes one re evaluate just what is important in the moment . my 7 year old pup and i read most of this book out on our deck and we were sorry to get to the it is one i will read several times and probably see something new each time .
2			lesson	important			as touching as it is wacky . horton remarks an elephant's faithful 100 percent ! as he struggles to keep his word by protecting a lazy bird's egg . it teaches the important lesson of standing on principle , in spite of the hardships one might encounter along the way . of course it comes across as fun , never preachy . this book actually brings tears to my eyes , even though it is so zany !
2			it	compelling	aproval	general	it	brilliant			brilliant . just adding to the general aproval that this book has garnered . i thought it brilliant and compelling . though i wasn not particularly involved with the plot the quality of the writing and characterisation was sufficient to make it a 5 reqardless .
1			producers	ashamed	perfection	visual	people	talented	crap	complete	looks	like	mastering	horrible			my favorite film ruined by horrible mastering . i own this on dvd and vhs . i saw it 14 times in theaters . i know what the film looks like . and stanley kubrick was notorious for his pathological compulsion to visual perfection . this blu ray looks like complete crap . the producers should be ashamed . what garbage can did they pull their master out of ? go buy the 2001 a space odyssey blu ray instead , which was obviously put together by people who were technically very talented . seriously .
2			history	powerful	books	important			a master piece . maybe os sertoes , the title in portuguese , is one of the most important books ever writen by a brazilian amazingly powerful history of the war at the world's end must be read . after 100 years , cunha has been recognized in several european centers as a genius and his unique book considered a master piece , after decades of prejudice and injustice even in his own country .
1			players	new	read	easy no			only for new players . if you know anything at all about hold em this is not the book for you . it does help with learning how to figure odds but everything else it covers can be picked up with a few hands at the table . the book assumes that you are playing with less than mediocre players , and its advice varies greatly depending on how talented your competition is . it is not an easy read .
2			sub	powerful	value	best			awesome 5.1 system . this was the best value i found in home theater syste ms the amplifier is well constructed and uses a massive transformer in it's power supply , not a cheap switching supply that box systems use . the speakers sound great for their size and the sub is powerful enough to shake the walls and annoy the neighbors if you live in an apartment like me .
2			purchase	good	product	little			good purchase but not enough for the money . i like the reflectiveness and width of this tape . i am using it on several areas of my trike . but even though it is listed i was still surprised by how little product you receive for the money . i would recommend this product still .
1			movie	bad			trying to hard . what a bad movie . seems like the guys who made this movie had never even been to a rave before . no plot usually that's pretty cool , but here it just doesnt do anything . music isnt all that good , even the way the people danced in the thing just didnt seem like a truly accurate portrayal of the scene . although ive seen so many people like the newbie guy , whose naivete kinda lightens the burden of suffering through the rest of this languid failed attempt portraying the rave scene as it really is .
1			chart	real	reviews	negative	reviews	positive	cd	excellent			disappointment . i purchased this cd for my girlfriend who loves neo soul and we both disliked this cd . the songs are flat and not well delivered . i went on the advice of positive reviews which was a mistake because i should have also read the negative reviews before making my purchase . i would recommend ledisi lost & found , she has a song entitled in the morning a real chart making hit for neo soul . all tracks on that cd are excellent .
2			read	great	story	true			great read . exciting story of survival that will keep you wanting to read more with each chapter . a very well told true story !
1			quality	poor	design	nice	look	good no	quality	bad			poor quality ; unpractical . we ordered this peeler , thinking it would be a nice design ; but turned out to be bad quality and does not even look that good .
2			bumps	little	it	big	product	good	i	careful	wallet	main			good product . i ended up using this bag as my main wallet for my whole vacation . i got three of them , and one of them got damaged by some keys or something in my pocket , so i switched to one of the others . it still didn not leak , but it had little bumps on it like the plastic was stretched . nothing ever got wet in any of these bags the whole trip . i was careful to seal it properly every time , and i didn not get sand in it . it was just big enough to hold my passport , some cash , atm receipts , etc now that i have tried them , i will probably get more in some of the larger sizes . just as convenient as my usual zip lock bags , but way more durable .
1			women	young	fan	big	nothing	scary	part	good			i dont get it ? i am a very big fan of horror movies , i have been snice i was around 5 or so . this was on sometime during hallooween on amc , and it was always one of the 100 most horror movies on bravo . when i watched it before that show was on i saw a few parts and though to myself when does the good part come ? but i ended up about to fall asleep so i taped it , but not every part came on , then i watched it again and though to myself this is not even scary what makes it so scary ? movies mostly about a young women and her husband who want a kid , then when she gets it supposly she's rapped by the devil , and her kids the devil living inside her , but nothing really scary happened i was pretty dispointed .
2			tune	big	quality	amazing	band	big			kenton goes funky ! i am often disappointed by kenton albums , but two of his albums stick out as amazing . and this is one of them . the recording quality is amazing and captures the vitality of a well rehearsed and very able funky big band . blue gene is the funkiest big band tune i have ever hea rd . absolutely brilliant .
2			design	similar	product	good	design	comfortable no			useful ? the product is as good as you can expect . all mouse pad has very similar design , which is not comfortable to use , in my opinion .
2			rollarcoaster	emotional			amazing ! a desert island recording ! wow ! wow ! wow ! these are the words that i continued to spew over and over after listening to this breathtaking tour de force . i was brought through an emotional rollarcoaster . one moment full of glee the next full of sorrow . angela hewitt is the definite symbolic symbol of bach that the world has seen this century . some may argue gould , landowska or tureck . just buy the cd for yourself hommies , the proof is in its suberb quality . wow wow wow
2			writing	good	i	wrong			best of the best in travel writing . in his introduction paul theroux writes , when something human is recorded , good travel writing happens . theroux always records the human aspects of countries and people he meets along the way . he records the scene outside the train window or porthole like no one else . close to poetic in some sections . i have read almost all of theroux's books and when i picked up this one i was afraid it would just be excerpts from his travels and might be less than satisfying , the tales taken out of conntext . i was wrong . these stories are gems in their own right , timeless , and may inspire you to read more of his books , fiction and nonfiction .
2			bit	little	son	old			love it . my 6 year old son loved it . worn it once , started tearing a little bit , but its a costume so as to be expected . totally worth it . brought many smiles !
2			aboslute	best	album	new			nas is king ! ! nas proves he is the aboslute best in the game with his new album . the tracks are hotter than ever and nas brings some of the hottest lyrics we have heard in a long time . jay z is no match for this rap icon
2			buy	great	interviews	current	collins	young			the gothic intrigue continues ! in this third , four disc set of dvds produced by the ambitious company mpi , dr julia hoffman has confronted the vampire barnabas collins about his condition and promises him her help to find a cure . since maggie's escape , barnabas has turned his affections to the collin's family's naive governess , victoria winters who is engaged to burke devlin , arch nemesis of roger collins . barnabas plots vengence on burke who is suspious of barnabas absence in the daytime . young david collins , suspicious of cousin barnabas , becomes locked in the family mausoleum in a secret room where barnabas escaped his imprisonment in a coffin . david enlists the help of barnabas sister , sarah whose spirit now haunts the grounds since barnabas release from his coffin . spooky and atmospheric ! a great buy in this compact format . also contains bonus current interviews with cast members including jonathan frid !
2			competition	serious	day	next	needs	good	roads	incredible	book	good			good book , needs updated . this is a good book for the cyclist seeking roads to ride in contra costa , alameda , and marin county and was at my bedside as i planned the next day's ride during the 1980 s and early 1990 s . the book shows you in percent how steep some road grades can be and what to expect . however the book needs to be updated badly , published in the early 1980 s , and due to the population and housing explosion in the bay area and the delta , some roads have changed and even are not there anymore . i would like to see the author do a book on calaveras county which has some incredible roads to ride placing it in serious competition with marin county .
1			jvc	high	it	great	it	worth			say what . if this worked , it would be great . unfortunately , it doesn not . even with the unit placed on top of the radio a high end jvc some reviewers have mentioned that reception was dependent on the quality of the fm receiver , it was still filled with static , and sounded cheap which admittedly , the ipod is . i don not know if it's worth the postage to return it to amazon . from all i m reading , it might work well if you are in an uncrowded fm area but i wouldn not bet on it .
1			me	warm	response	good			cools easily . i was disappointed with the ability of this fabric to keep me warm . the fabric would cool right down when exposed to the cold . my wife had a good response to these . although , she too discovered that the fabric needed an outer layer to keep the warmth in .
1			plot	helpful	johannsen	easy	shots	interesting	photography	nice	johannsen	young			nice photography , that's about it . the critics gave two thumbs up , and the box descreibes as hilarious , but i think plot would have been helpful . oh well , the background shots of tokyo are interesting , and almost make up for the nihilism , but a travelogue would have worked just as well . the young actress johannsen is certainly easy on the eyes . overall , definitely a long , extended rock video with near zero content . bill was better on saturday night live .
2			day	next	videos	best	workout	great			i love ellen . this is one of the best crunch videos in my workout library . i love the emphasis the instuctor places on my abs , butt , and thighs . i m always a little sore the next day , but i also know i experienced a great workout !
2			it	nice	dryer	great	it	compact			great hair dryer . this is a great hair dryer and it is nice and compact . easy to install . if you like the ones at the finer motels you will love this one . also has a night light .
1			it	annoying			mildly entertaining for baby , but wicked annoying to clean . we have one of these and it does keep the babies interest somewhat . though i don not see the point to the hand puppet , and the blue spinning thing with the metal in it sounds as if they didn not put more than 1 washer in it . also the sun isn not quite flexible enough for baby to chew on easily . but our daughter loves the sound generator . anyway , compared to other brands i dislike this product on two , it is damn near impossible to clean . nothing snaps in or out , it is very annoying to disassemble . 1 10 for cleaning . anyone who's even been around children realizes how important this is , no idea why this is so , it isn not portable at all . many of the competing products fold down shorter for tossing into the trunk or front seat . this is fixed in size or taller if needed . the top and bottom do not easily pop apart without tools either .
1			music	good	status	particular			childish . some albums / bands are afforded a particular status as a received opinion , the velvets are one such . there music is conventional . their lyrics obvious , but it is uncool to say so , there was some good music made in the late 60 s , beefheart not by this band however .
1			horrible	horrible	product	worst			horrible , horrible , horrible don not waste money . the worst product ever ! why , you ask ? because it didn not even work ! i put the battery in and it wouldn not turn on . don not waste your time with this plastic piece of junk !
2			book	best	book	great			great book ! ! ! this is a great book for kids and adults that love hunting . this book has gotten me in the woods to hunt turkey . i killed a turkey because of the tactics in the book . this is the only book i have gotten into . this is the best book i have ever read .
1			left	next	product	old	map	new			do not buy the c 220 . the c 220 is an old product and apparently they are not updating it i called support and got nothing . for about $ 10 more you can get the c 230 which has updated maps you can not get a new map for the c 220 , better voice navigation streets are named when you turn on them turn left at smith st instead of take next left . or you could consider a different manufacturer entirely .
1			crooners	real	stars	senior	songbook	great			send him to an assisted living home . this is what happens when senior citizen rock stars try and legitimize a fruitful but wasted life . don not waste your money . buy some sinatra or bennett albums and listen to real crooners . in the great american songbook series stewart sounds like he needs a quart of oil . rod stick to what you know . you are no michael buble or peter cincatti . spare us , just go and enjoy your retirement . or , better yet go back to when you used to wear spandex .
1			i	disappointed	fans	biggest	story	interesting no	dissappointment	big	monolith	incredible	nothing	new			3001 the big dissappointment . being one of arthur clarke's biggest fans , i was amazingly disappointed with this novel . the story about frank was simply uninteresting , and at least to me was far fetched . nothing new was brought to the table here , in fact , the fact that clarke relies on the much cliche would computer virus to defeat the amazing monolith was simply too incredible for me . this , coupled with enough too many references to star trek , made me nauseous . i have never been as disappointed since reading his co written cradle .
2			i	glad	charger	new	i	satisfied	charger	big	snug	little	phone	old	deal	great	asphalt	hard			does it's job . i have a w 810 , and my last charger that came with the phone was beginning to fail . so i explored the option of a new charger , hoping that i could find one for dirt cheap , and hoping that it was an issue with the charger and not my phone . needless to say , when you can get something for 2 cents , which i did plus the $ 2.98 in s&h ; that is a great deal in any works . plain and simple my w 810 has survived falling down 500 foot mountainsides , water damage , as a doggy chew toy , flying out of my lap from the car onto hard asphalt , who knows how many times , and so on , and i am glad it will continue to survive for hopefully at least another year or one problem with this charger is it is a little snug when i plug my phone in , and occasionally the phone will keep beeping signaling it is beginning to charge until i unplug it and plug it back in . just an issue with an old phone i guess , and a charger that may be slightly too big . other than that i am satisfied !
2			i	surprised	it	good	caper	great	chemistry	real			a great caper . i was really surprised by this movie . when it first came out , i didn not know what it was or what it was about . i first saw it on television about three years later , so i decided to rent it . when the credits began to roll , i wanted to watch it again because it was so good . the movie was well acted , well written , and well directed . jennifer lopez and george clooney had real chemistry . scott frank is one of my favorite screenwriters , and this movie proves it . the cameos of micheal keaton and samuel jackson only spice up the flavor of this well crafted film . a must for any movie fan .
2			start	good	series	great			good start . good start to what i hope will be a great series . occasionally confusing but i expect that everything will be explained in 7 books !

1			seats	high	design	great no	seats	low			flimsy . i am used to a britax marathon . my infant son needed the britax , so i needed another carseat . we looked high & low for booster / convertible seats to find the right one . we bought this evenflo seat and when i got it out of the box , i realized how flimsy the design is . you can take the armrest and wiggle the whole carseat with one move . it is just not a great design . we are returning it .
1			person	modern	history	good no	period	correct	book	worst	fiction	historical			dreadful . possibly the worst book i have ever history is not good being english the term pa will paddle my backside is not really something that a modern english person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of king richa rd it just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold , i love historical romances / fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct !
2			image	particular	selection	limited	book	best	it	helpful	exposition	best	structure	rich			best exposition of blake . blake sets us in the middle of a rich mythological structure . this is the best book for explaining what that structure is and how blake will come to an element and illuminate sometimes inconsistent characteristics of that element if viewed in a limited selection . and yet when blake's work is examined as a whole an encompassing structure is revealed where each part has been carefully delineated and accurately described throughout . since blake's collected works are rather massive it is very helpful to have an overview of blake's view of man when examining how any one particular image is dealt with in a poem . else , one might think that blake's portrayals are incongruent from poem to poem , while his vision is actually quite cohesive . frye wrote another excellent essay on blake , the title has something to do with the fourfold key . it shows the structural similarity between blake , marx and freud .
1			fan	huge			wanted to like it but . the premise for this book is what caught my attention but the story itself disappointed , especially as a huge deveraux fan . i liked nicole's character and the contrasting view of the very bloody french revolution with 18 h century revolutionary america and , because of it , i think this story could have been something so much more . but the character development and the relationship development was uneven and voluminous . sometimes less is more .

2			duo	best	i	amazed	book	good			a wonderful conclusion . i have read the whole chronicles series , and this book is just as good as the others . margaret weis and tracy hickman are the best duo in the writing business and probably the most famous too . i am continually amazed by the talent margaret weis has for writing fantasy and sci fi will she ever run out of ideas ? i hope not . i am making it my life's goal to obtain every piece of writing she has ever written . keep in the business , margaret weis . you are one of the be st i m sure anyone who feels the same way i do agrees .

2			budget	low	acting	terrible	acting	bad	ends	loose			good if you like bad ! this flick was a decent attempt for a low budget film . the acting was bad but not terrible . interesting to me was that they wouldn not show anyone actually snorting the drug . they would pan away when someone was taking a snort . i guess they didn not want younger viewers to learn anything about the how to part of doing drugs . the ending left a lot of loose ends dangling but whatcha gonna do ?
2			thought	entertaining	side	new	i	impressed	movie	suck			captivating ! i saw the trailer and thought this movie would suck . but once i stepped in the theater , i was utterly impressed . will smith delivers a wonderful performance showing us a new side to his mistique . i think it makes us all wonder about technology . before anyone gets crazy , that cant really happen , ok . still the thought is entertaining
1			film	great	agreement	complete	copy	regular	version	regular	feature	entire			less for more . i am in complete agreement with all the other reviewers who rated the wb release of this ultra violet version with one or two stars . the film is great however , this release is inferior the ultra violet does not work and the regular dvd copy does not have a chapter menu / index . your only choice is to play the entire feature and skip through the scenes manually . the blu ray copy does not work in any of my players so i feel like i received less product for more money . i will likely reaturn this for a regular dvd version only .

1			school	high			to jill piangerelli . as a 14 year old about to enter high school , i am highly offended by your review stating that those who claim that is novel is boring and the worst they have ever read . basically have no right to criticize this novel . let me ask you something . do you see what it says at the middle of the page ? it says share your thoughts . which means that if anybody dosen not like this book , than , basically , they do have a right to review this novel . the only exception is when they post it repeatedly and insult others who disagree with them . that's trolling . i beg you and other reviewers to consider this . just because someone dosen not like a piece of literature dosen not make them a lazy bum .

1			they	unique	fan	big no	mckennitt	modern			i don not get the hype . worst and most useless use of the hurdy gurdy ever . i love bands that use cool instruments like dead can dance , loreena mckennitt both pretty ambient and neutral milk hotel more modern , ecclectic . this band seems like they just throw in a bunch of instruments to try and be unique and hip . i agree with the reviewers that think this is a droning rip off of much better bands . i can see the references to joy division , maybe echo and the bunnymen in the inflection / strain of the singers voice . i m not a big fan of modest mouse or the other pack of whiney bands , although i do like white stripes and franz ferdinand .
2			interactions	amazing	others	safe	relationships	amazing			heartwarming ! fun ! memorable . this is the best of the be st i have read it too many times to count . the relationships and interactions between all characters were amazing and spellbinding . i loved in the end when johanna said my clan's my family and each one of us would die to keep the others safe . i recommend this to everyone i know who has been in an unbearable situation and triumph over it .
2			cases	large	shape	good	tree	nice	price	good	it	nice			nice tree . this tree was much heavier and bulkier than i expected . it is nice and full and the lights are nicely wrapped and spaced . good shape to the tree . lots of tips . however the reusable carton is garbage . it came to me dented in and then proceeded to rip beyond repair while we tried to take the tree out . i ended up buying two large plastic tree storage cases to accommodate the bulk of this tree . storage is a all in all , it is a nice better than anything i have seen here locally and the gold box price is very good !

2			impression	great	commercials	previous	trek	best	part	best	story	compelling			biography of spocks father sarek . the story is intriging and compelling . it has all the ingredients for a riviting story . the best part about the audio is that it is read by mark lena rd he is an excellent reader and has done saab commercials previous to this . he makes you feel like your there . and he can do enough with the voices that you can vividly see all the characters . he even does a great spock impression . absolutely the best star trek audio ever .
2			it	fun	sons	old	children	young	game	great	it	easy			great game for family fun ! we played it first at a friend's place with his 4 year old and seven year old sons . we got so hooked onto it that we bought a set for ourselves and a couple of gift sets as well ! it is very fun and easy to learn even for young children . however , it is not a winding down or relaxing game it charges you up as your brain is constantly on the lookout for the matching patterns . there are no limits on number of players it can be played by as few as two players , or as many as you want . the same set of cards has so many different ways of making sets that each game is totally of all , it is like a pack of cards , so you can carry it with you easily on trips and play anywhere .
1			replacement	new			waste of money no support from wayne . i hav had this pump and had to receive replcement pumps . the new replacement failed out of the box . cannot get anyone from wayne to return calls or emails . spent over $ 1 500.00 on this junk ! probably why they do not sell it anymore ! i want my money back !
1			necklace	nice	metal	cheap			over the top . i thought this was going to be a nice dainty necklace that i would be able to wear with many different outfits . however , when i received it , it was much clunkier than i had expected . it feels like it weighs a ton on y neck . it's very over the top and flashy and the metal is very cheap and has broken .
2			daughter	old	i	happy no	it	safe			my 5 year old daughter loves this movie ! for whatever reason , my daughter , who just turned 5 loves this movie . she would watch it all day every day if she could . whenever we get to watch a movie , she wants this one . there is some bullying , which i am not happy about , and some of the attitudes that is , sharkboy are needless and probably not what kids need to be hearing but all in all it's safe compared to most junk out there .
2			purpose	intriguing	flow	intriguing	vocabulary	extensive			reading in the labyrinth of chaos . as i began to read the pages of this book , i immediately began to draw comparisons to umberto eco , due to the intellectual flow of the prose . i have much respect for umberto's work , and brian's hit me with the same feeling . the only knock i would give to it is the excessive use of ten cent words . i have an extensive vocabulary , and brian had me reaching for the dictionary with every chapter . purpose and flow are intriguing , and it is a satisfying read . the subject matter is approached very well . this is definately a book that begs to be evaluated by each reader . i would say it is a challenge to complete , one worth noting .

2			classic	original	book	true			a classic of american literature . if a book is really true , you will always need it . you will always come back to it . birdy is one of those books ; my copy is a yellowed and dog earred paperback with the front cover torn off , yet i find myself year after year coming back to the novel , digging into it , nibbling on its tasty paragraphs , savoring its language and cool understanding of the world . i m convinced that birdy will rank one day as a truly original american classic , right up there with salinger's catcher in the rye and kesey's one flew over the cuckoo's ne st there's so much energy and passion in the story it literally overwhel ms you live inside the character of birdy as you listen , all ears , to a guy named al speaking about his friend . you begin to soar , to fly , to be free , just as birdy is trying to be all those things himself . truly an extraordinary work ! tom maremaa , author of the forthcoming novel metal heads from kunati books in spring 2009

2			metal	short	album	solid			solid album overall , easy on the ears . far more pop oriented than anything else josh homme has been involved in . i would like to mention that this really isn not his side project ; it's the project of a friend of his and he was invited as the band's drummer . overall , worth a listen and may well strike a chord with you . i will admit , though , that lyrics like miss alissa . gonna do a voodoo you feel my power now ? are a tad hokey . but you will start to feel that , if anything , peace love death metal is too short in the sense that you would like some more to listen to .
2			ways	good	game	enjoyable	gameplay	good			good , but not dreamcast . at first , this game disappointed me somewhat . having the tennis 2 2 version for dreamcast , i expected it to be a little more like that one . i knew the graphics weren not going to be as good , that was a given . however , the parts it does carry over still make it an enjoyable game . the world tour , and the gameplay with resembles the dreamcast one in many ways . 50 of the things which made the dreamcast version have really good gameplay , are still implemented in this . however , about 50 of the other stuff that also made the dreamcast version really fun , seem to be lacking . they could have done a few things much better . also , disappointing that you have to have more than 1 cartridge to play multiplayer . this is still a fun game though , especially for 10 bucks . i would have to recommend it , whether or not you are a fan of the dreamcast version . just beware , not the same in many good ways .
1			book	complete	book	new	details	specific	book	general			lots of basset photos , short on basset specifics . i got the 1995 edition of this when i got my basset . i enjoyed the many photos of bassets , but was disappointed that most of the book appears to be a generic insert that fits in any general dog book complete with lots of advertisements for miscellaneous dog stuff . it looks like there is a fill in the blank form used to create the books where you type in a few breed specific details and lots of photos and presto ! a new book .

2			book	good			i liked the book . an unlikely romance is another good book written by my favorite romance book author betty neels , i really enjoyed reading it and i liked the characters a dutch guy named krijin van der brink schaaksma and an english lady named beatrice doveton . this book is a keeper .
2			albums	best	music	enjoyable	music	great	album	great	lyrics	strong			great music . this album is great . the music is enjoyable and just enough off of mainstream to be great . the lyrics , while not the most eloquent ever , are strong and full of emotion . one of the best albums in my collection .

1			facts	true			don not bother with this book . there is a lot of fiction written about the supposed history of the templars and if you like that kind of thing , all well and good . however if you want to know the true facts about the templars , as apposed to speculation , i would suggest that you look elsewhere at other books , such as those written by barber or piers paul read .
1			everything	wrong	children	worst	films	worst			one of the 50 worst films ever . everything is wrong in the disaster as all the charm , sadness and drama of this classic is gone . charlotte should be a hairy spider with a lucille laverne type voice , not a gorgeous arachnid with miss reynold's soothing tones . this is a story of friendship and self sacrifice which is totally missing . and the tragic death of charlotte , which is the highlight of the story , is simply glossed over . along with the cat in the hat and the grinch , charlotte's web is one of a trio of worst children's films of all time .
2			book	little	chemistry	high	you	familiar	quantities	small			fun little book of chemistry tricks . unless you are currently familiar with chemistry projects , i would suggest thast you get caveman chemistry to go along with this book . after roughly 35 years i have finally figured out how those rowdy high school chemistry students blew the shoes off a student in a stairwell they explain how if used in small quantities you get a harmless snap crackle and pop sound but when over applied you get a highly sensitive explosion that a feather touch can set off . learn how ot make invisible ink , to turn whisky into water . to turn water to milk back to water . many magic tricks that are done with chemistry .
1			part	best	jane	unbelievable			first and last time ? this is the first iris johansen thriller i have read and unfortunately it will probably be my la st the characters are so predictable in their responses to each other that i knew what they would say before they said it . i listened to it as a book on tape which probably made that worse . but jane , the focus of the book , is simply unbelievable . aldo and his obsession strain credibility . the best part was the information about life in ancient herculaneum and the volcanic eruption .

2			work	particular	one	great	genre	particular	deal	great	stories	short			this one is great but depends upon your taste . i personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work . many other reviewers have gone into the plot , etc so i will not do so here to any depth . this is one of those works of sifi that will appeal to certain taste , while others may find it not to their liking . there is a great deal of politics almost pre wwi european involved in the story line . as the story covers all books included over one thousand years , there are many , many characters to track and keep track of . this is indeed a series of short stories , all linked . i personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not . that being said , it , the book , can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such . you certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination . i enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it .
2			buyer	previous	it	loud			works too good . i bought this cleaner and i couldn not be happier with the results ! the only problem i had with it was that i put my eyeglasses in it set the timer and forgot about them . when the machine stopped i took out my glasses it took some of the paint off of the frames ! now when i clean my glasses i just dip them in with the cleaner running . i don not feel that it is loud like a previous buyer said . i would and have recommend this one to anyone out there that takes pride in how their jewelry looks ! !

2			it	rich			a joy to read . not since i read on april 11 1986 russell baker's pulitzer prize winning growing up has there been a book of this genre which has so moved me . i spent a rural boyhood myself , but i cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as jimmy carter's , and it was not spent in georgia . this is a very pleasant book to read , and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well written book , full of insight and nostalgia . i hope it wins this year's or next year's pulitzer prize for biography or autobiography , as russell baker's delightful book did in 1983
1			son	old			very flimsy lid . i bought this sandbox for my 2 1 2 year old son , and he loves playing in the sand with it . however , i am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the naturally playful sandbox which i was originally going to purchase , but got this one instead to save $ 10 mistake . as soon as i put the lid on it caved in the middle of course , i already had sand in it . also , the lid just seems to lay on the top , and could be easily blown off . i m sure it won not last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back .
1			sizes	nice	sizes	soft			plastic internal parts break easily . this machine seemed like an excellent buy at fir st it makes nice soft chewy ice cubes in three selectable sizes . however , the machine broke down within a year . customer service replaced the parts free of charge the first time , but the machine just broke down again . it's no longer under warranty . so basically , this machine lasted just 16 machine breaks easily because the movable parts , that is , the water tray and its connector to the stepping motor are made out of brittle plastic . the minute a piece of ice gets stuck in such a manner as to prevent the tray from pushing the ice down into the bucket , the motor doesn not sense the problem and continues to push forward until one of these parts machine did pay for itself if you count that we use 15 bags of ice a month at 1.50 a bag .

1			looked	perfect	bowl	small	unbreakable	free	looked	beautiful			rim is separating from bowl after 2 weeks . have used this for 2 weeks exactly 14 uses and already the rim of the bowl is separating from the rest of the piece ! it looked perfect and beautiful when it arrived . it has never hit the floor . we hand wash it and hand dry it directly after each use . i wanted this to be a toxin free unbreakable dish for my bought it as a test before buying a whole bunch of type of quality is not going to work out . i m saddened that i can not buy more and also really upset that it didn not last longer ! ! ! if you want a small , pretty bowl then go ahead but don not buy it if you plant to actually use it !
2			book	remarkable			a remarkable book . if you like mystical , magicical tales , you will devower this book three headed dogs , brooms with different levels of power and stones that not only turn metal into gold but offer immortality .
2			style	old	it	easy			mythology rules . the iliad by homer is a book that i think everyone can enjoy it comes in a lot of different reading levels and is relativly easy to understand . i thought the book was well written and the plot kept me reading for more . i recommend this book to anyone who likes the old school style of art of war and sword vs shield style genre .
1			thing	next	songwriter	good	man	southern			preacing , again . neil is a good singer songwriter , but his preachiness gets in the way of his more well written songs . maybe toby keith will do another southern man don not need him around , anyhow , type lyric . why do people in the industry feel the need to speak out instead of letting people figure things out on their own . you might as well be a politician . next thing you know , he will be jumping up on oprah's couch . if you like this sort of drivel , help yourself , but you would be better off buying some of his better works . take a pill , neil .
2			manual	complete	manual	easy	system	nice	manual	simple	quality	superb	system	critical			nice system . i used have the same handset and batteries for two years now handset made in usa . i spilled coffee on the handset and some buttons became a little insensitive while still usable , but that is my fault . interference is a problem only when using the microwave . the sound quality is superb under the conditions i base station location with this and any system is absolutely critical . i had no problems with setup of any kind . the manual is simple , complete and easy to understand .
1			gyroscope	dull	quality	low	i	disappointed			do not buy . i know because i bought it . the gyroscope spins out of control and the string snaps on the first pull . the gyroscope is ugly and dull . i am verry disappointed and so will you if you get this . do not buy it . it is made of lead and stains your finger when you toutch it . this toy is very low quality and it stinks . as i said before do not buy .
2			it	worth	actor	good	job	good			the animal very funny . my brother and i saw , this i really liked this rob is a good actor i like his movies , well anyways after a car accidant he is taken to a dr who puts animal parts in him this was funny it is worth the money colleen haskell was in the cbs series survivor she did a good job in this lots of laughs go see this .
1			behavior	common	behavior	cultural	me	interested			c . s . lewis lost me on the first chapter . this book builds up chapter by chapter as sort of an argument for christianity . the first chapter tries to argue that all people , for all time in all cultures , all have an inante sense of moral law , and despite minor differences , everyone has the same moral law , and that therefore , there must be a god . i find it incomprehensibly narrow minded that lewis feels the only explanation for humans having common , cross cultural behavior , is a god . i was hoping for this book to keep me interested for quite a while , but instead i m getting a rehashing of descartes , and no credit is even given !
2			workout	best	sections	small	workout	great	purchase	great	instructor	easy			i advice you to buy this workout dvd ! this is the best dvd workout i have ever bought . i have never written a review of a workout dvd before , but i felt like i had to because it was a great purchase . i was challenged and sweating ! i did not have a step so i had to follow the modified instructor which was easy to follow . the dvd was broken up into small sections covering different workouts and mixing cardio and strength training . i wanted to quit within the first five minutes because it was so difficult , but i am so happy that i worked through it because it was a great workout . if you complete this dvd , you will notice a difference in your body !
1			quality	great	features	great			would have been great if it only accepted paper . add my voice to the throng of unsatisfied customers who own this one . the features are great , the print quality's great , but once the paper stops feeding except manually a sheet at a time and even then only after several attempts and paper jams , you are hosed . look elsewhere .
1			knife	easy	knife	sharp	steel	poor	utensils	good	period	short			room for improvement . for the most part , i have enjoyed my good grips utensils . the mini chef knife was easy to handle and very sharp at fir st however the blade became dull after a short period of very light use . now it's even showing rust spots ! i can only think oxo used poor quality steel in this knife for it to have deteriorated so quickly .
2			film	great	you	interested			great film . this is one of my most favorite films of all time if you are interested in ancient history or like movies like spartacus or ben hur you should love gladiator !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the best of the batman movies . this has to be the best of the batman movies so far . mostly due to michelle pfeiffer catwomen who steals every scene she is in . very dark and creepy just as batman was originally intended to be . may be too scary for kids .
2			child	old	routine	pleasant	thing	best	pot	entire	brewer	great	family	entire	water	hot			great for more than just coffee ! this brewer has been great for me and my entire family . not only did it help me get my 4 cup a day coffee addiction under control i m now down to one cup because i don not have to make an entire pot , but i found another use for it . i use the hot water with no k cup inserted to make instant oatmeal . i hated doing it in the microwave because it always makes a mess , and a 1 year old child does not understand that you have to wait for water to boil on the stove . this machine has made my morning routine much more pleasant and easier ! i also use the auto replenish ordering for my k cups through amazon . best thing i ever did !
1			book	entire	story	entire			where is voyager ? although i have enjoyed carey's past trek novels i found this one to be a bit dull . voyager's strength is in its ensemble ca st writing an entire book around one character janeway with no interaction with other crew members is a mistake . and why give so much attention to aliens ? i thought a requirement for trek novel publication was to adhere to trek base an entire story on non trek characters . if i buy a star trek book i want to read a story with star trek characters . are you reading this pocket books ? ? ?
2			character	main	light	mysterious	book	awesome			yes ! ! he's done it again . book is awesome ! mark , the main character is transported through time when he is on a hiking trip when he ventures towards a mysterious blue light and is sucked in . he then is forced to survive in the so called future . mark must find edible food , englsh speaking humans and friends such as his monkey to help him out . all sorts of elements come towards him that he must conquere and many things that he must come toward and conquere . during this book he finds other tribes and becomes parts of them , gets maried to an indian and also rides across nearly a whole desert . i would like to tell more but i worry i m telling to much ! i hope you find my review helpful !
2			pc	new	it	great			windows vista . it is so great that i want to install the interactive multimedia dvd in my new pc but seems it doesn not work with windows vista . did anybody solved this problem ?
2			viewer	casual			a lucid look at politics today . a well researched look at the evangelical right and their gradeschool level of pollyannism politics which is chilling to even the most casual viewer . i highly recommend this book which will give you nightmares !
1			things	great	workout	great	i	excited	i	upset	job	bad			not well done , not worth it . i was very excited to get this dvd , i had heard great things and who is going to argue with burning 1000 calories in a hour ? i was really upset when i started my first workout and you couldn not see the trainer's whole body . they would start sets of her working out showing her from the waist up , i had no idea what she was doing with her feet ! i think it would have been a great workout , but they did a bad job filming it .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			very suspicious reviews ! hmmm . has anyone else noticed that the reviews are all 5 stars , posted within three weeks of each other , and by people with no other reviews ? sure makes one wonder .
1			book	ridiculous	premise	basic	lives	private			misinformed , hateful , and disgusting . this book is ridiculous . the basic premise is flawed . this country was founded on the idea of the separation of church and state . while many of the founding fathers were christians in their private lives , they were secular humanists in their public lives . secular humanists haven not taken over this country ; they are the reason this country exists , are the people who wrote our constitution and declaration of independence , and are the true patriotic is far right fundamentalists loonies like lahaye and his ilk who are threatening to take over the country and who want to distort its origins .
1			reviews	negative			terrible . we should have given more of our attention to the negative reviews on here , especially those who report that it only worked a few times and then never again . i received this unit on a tuesday afternoon , later that evening after reading all of the instructions , i prepared to get some relief for my swollen feet . after filling with water , i plugged in the unit and pressed the power button , nothing . we tried in several outlets and no luck . we adjusted the water level too . so buyer beware , some of these work only a few times and some don not work at all like ours .
1			it	bored	actors	bad			absolutetly bad . i would prefered not to buy this movie , it was bored and the actors were as bad as they could . there's nothing interesting in the movie , not even the sex scenes .
1			budget	low	dvd	low			waste of money and time . freaknik party not even on this dvd . omg ! what a waste ! the cover says freaknik , with guest appearances by outkast , goodie mob , lazy bone and others . the freanik part of the dvd does not even appear on this does appear on this dvd is a low budget film of los angles lowrider car culture , which has lowriders cars jumping up and down . if your into that , and want to see it ona low budget dvd , then this is for you . no freaknik fun , on this dvd . avoid ! !
2			picture	major no	book	phenomenal			terrific book . this is the kind of love story that we all hope for , but never get almost ? . when i first read this book , it was not a major motion picture , but held my attention from beginning to end . i also believe that while the book was phenomenal , sadly , the movie did not do this story any justice . i beleive the actors could have done a better job personifying the protagonists this was my first nicholas sparks book ; i remember thinking how much i love this book and was immediately on the lookout for other sparks books . i recommend this book 100 !
1			cruelty	hate	shredder	new	books	true	torture	hate	escape	enjoyable			horrified and disgusted . if i could give this less than one star , i would ! i usually love karen robards books . i have several of her books that i reread at least once a year . this one is horrifying ! when i got to the villian pouring kerosene on a dog in preparation to set him on fire , i threw the book across the room . two weeks later , i ripped the book apart and fed it into my new cross cut shredder . i love books and this is the first and only book i have ever felt compelled to destroy so no one else had to read it . if i want something disgusting enough to give me nightmares , i will read true crime books or watch the news . reading books is supposed to be an enjoyable escape , not something that you spend weeks trying to get out of your head every time you close your eyes . especially disappointing is when the book is written by one of your favorite authors and it's supposed to be romance . my advice if you love animals and hate needless torture and cruelty , don not read this book !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			another fine pos from cuisinart the cpm -900 k . purchased this and on the 3 d usage the handles that secure the heating plate to the base broke off . spending $ 60 for a popcorn popper , spending money on the cuisinart would expect more than three uses . do not buy this !
2			singer	great			jon secada is a great singer ! jon secada's first album was betterthan his second one . i have likedhim for a long time . i have two cdsnow and i enjoy listening to is also very handsome to see ont . v . keep on singing jon !
1			necklace	pretty			can not clasp it . the necklace is pretty , however , the clasp wont open far enough to attach to the chain so i cant even wear it .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			he's no tupac , biggie , or nas . people need to stop comparing this fool to pac , biggie and nas . i think thats an insult to those artists and completely untrue . first off , this album is not hip hop its spanish music . the beats are not even up to par on this album . also , this guy doesn not know if he wants to be domincan or puerto rican . i want to make a comment to gorrilla ; if you shook his hand tell him to put music out for everyone to listen not waste your money on this album . buy a sean paul , capleton , or sizzla album instead .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			i wasted 20 bucks . someone recenty wrote , without reservation reads like a john grisham novel . well , i read all of grisham and benedict is no john grisham .
2			it	expensive	quality	outstanding			b w 46 mm filter . this filter is of outstanding quality . i use it on my olympus e pl -1 it is a little more expensive than some of the other brands out there , but the quality of the glass makes a world of difference to me . excellent product , item shipped and arrived quickly .
2			writer	exceptional	gods	musical	variety	musical	album	next			can not wait for her next album . every now and then the musical gods figure it's time to send down another gift . patty griffin is an exceptional song writer and musician . her musical variety is on par with lennon / mcartney . yes that's what i said .
2			team	international	adventures	fantastic	collection	fantastic			amazing ! with this fantastic collection , i have revived the joy of my childhood , when i have accomplished the fantastic adventures of the international rescue team .
2			book	great			i found this book to be good . i think that this book is a great book . you must read it if you want to read the 8 h . jordan is one of my favorite authors . i found it to be exciting and leading ever closer to the end . i get caught up in the story worring how long rand can keep his sanity .
2			zealand	new			new zealand loves dexter ! hi i m from new zealand , i brought this product , dexter season 3 from amazon and being a zone one dvd which new zealand is not , it worked perfectly with my my dvd player and was way cheaper than me purchasing it in my own country . thanks amazon !
1			one	next			mr coffee replacement decanter . it leaks ! i m spilling more coffee than i m drinking ! i m going to return it and hopefully the next one won not leak !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			disappointingly faulty product . worked for one test period then ceased to power on ever again . better results after replacing with $ 20 no name product .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			excellent movie . very emotional moving movie . definitely good for those who wish to get a glimpse into the life of those who are mentally challenged .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			pal . euro trash , didn not work on my system . selling euro trash in america , they know it doesn not work here but what can u do
2			jacket	additional	jacket	nice	jacket	warm	feature	nice	pockets	big			women's crystal curve parka aqua . the jacket is very comfy and has big pockets . the only thing i hate is the zipper , which catches on the bottom and sometimes doesn not zip properly so you have to rezip it which is annoying . the jacket is warm enough not super warm and the additional attached underlying jacket is a nice feature so you can remove it when it's spring time . nice jacket for the price and durable so far .
2			combination	great			the third secret . what a fast researched and edge of your seat . a great combination for the voracious reader .
1			power	limited no	things	great	materials	extensive	herein	new	you	new	you	familiar	nothing	new			dissapointing , considering . that david barron has some excellent audio and video products . i was really expecting great things from david when i purchased this book , based on some of the other quality items i have of his . but there is nothing new herein this very brief book that hasn not been covered more extensively in other and better nlp and sales related books such as donald moines unlimited selling power , a must have for any sales , if you are familiar with nlp you will find nothing new . if you are new to nlp and hypnosis , there are better more extensive materials out there .
1			disappointment	complete	middle	detailed			where is the ending . i thought this book started out good and kept my intere st the last chapter or two was a complete disappointment , as a lot of the other reviewers state . i kept hitting my back buttons thinking i missed something this morning when i was finishing the ending . the ending just kind of fell off and no details / information were given for what happened which is really surprising considering how detailed the middle of the book was during the storm .
2			children	little	it	great			peekaboo bugs . it is great for parents of little children but i am a pre school music teacher and wanted it to use in my classes . not as practical .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			wtf . not only did it not come with any adapter tips for any cell phone but no where does it tell you how to get an adapter tip for your cell phone ! ! all it is is a silver tube and a battery , thats it ! ! dont go through the hassle , just buy a different brand that comes with tips for your phone .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the mother of all computer books . nothing compares to having fun with hypercard and it was danny goodmans book that opened this world to me . it begins slowly and still takes you up to the top at the end . i cannot use pascal or c but i still felt like a programmer at the end , spending many hours every day making hypercard scripts . all this thanks to mr goodman .
2			spacing	perfect	person	famous	it	easy			lots of fun . if you love cryptograms you will love this book ! each cryptogram was a quote by a famous person . the letter spacing was perfect making it easy to read and solve . each puzzle provides one clue . if you are diligent you shouldn not need the clues . only one draw back , the author should not have put the clue pages next to the answer pages . every once in a while i would go to the answer instead of the clue . this was a bit frustrating .
1			textbook	terrible			this textbook is terrible ! this book is written in unnecessarily complicated language and does not present information in a way that is easily understood . i teach graduate courses in quantitative methods and i made the mistake of ordering this book for one of my courses without reading it fir st it was a disaster ! unless you are getting a doctorate and need to know lots of complicated formulas without adequate explanations , do not buy this book .
1			coffee	weak			senseo sumatra . i didn not like this coffee . i m used to the dark roast and this coffee is just too bland and weak for my taste .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			awesome movie ! i think for one of the horror movies made in the 90 , this has got to be one of the better ones . i just loved everything about it and it had my attention held al the way to the end of the movie . lets also just say that i had watched this movie several years back on tv and had to find it to see it again because i liked it so much ;
2			shine	nice			nice light shine and dependable switch . i have had this light for 3 years now and being a flashlight geek , it is my favorite . slim enough to slip in your back pocket and sturdy enough to withstand being dropped . i like aa over aaa and the 2 aa's must last well over 40 hours . one led performs great and has less drain than the clusters . a button switch on the end is a no brainer to find .
1			luck	bad	performer	weak			weak performer . i bought these as an addition to many other rechargeable aa batteries . i have had bad luck with them so i just tested them in my lacross bc -900 charger and they came up with 650 -850 mahr capacity 2650 mahr rated . fully 1 3 or the rating . i have many older aa's that work great and hold up for years . i never fast charge and occationally run the conditioner function on some reason , these are not holding up . i just bought a bunch of eneloops . we will see how they hold up .
2			releases	new			very entertaining . i recommend this book very highly . anyone who enjoys chris moore , tom robbins or matt ruff will not be disappointed with this book . i look forward to any new releases from a . l . haskett .
2			sound	portable	they	comfortable			best earbuds ever ! i absolutely love these are the best sounding earbuds i have ever used and they are the most comfortable . they sound better than the $ 95 grado sr -80 s and the $ 50 skullcandy titans . they have crisp , clear sound and deep , full bass . they make my portable m 3 player sound great . i can use these for running and they don not fall out . there is no unwanted noise from the cord and they are very you are in the market for earbuds , give the sennheiser mx 55 s a try .
2			amnesty	international	memory	alive	voice	smooth			a must have cd . the amadou cd really moved me . it will keep the memory of this courageous man alive forever . joe coleman's voice is as smooth as ever . it is a if he was still singing with the platters , but this time his voice is full of compassion for a man who died a wrongful death . thank you for donating 10 of the proceeds of the cd to amnesty international . a must have album for all !
2			it	interesting	shenanigans	legal	background	little			somewhat laborious reading but interesting . it took some time to finish this boot , but it was interesting , and i think it gave me a little background about the legal shenanigans that may be involved in torts law .
1			it	hate	plan	suck	music	good			i didn not know simple plan changed their name . ya , when i first heard this , i thought it was simple plan . i mean come on ! they are just a sp clone . simple plan , who also suck , have obviously changed their name . hedley is one of those wah wah nobody understands me i just wanna cry all day bands . i hate it ! that is not how emo music should be . face it , these guys are not punk . their pop . in my world , it's illegal to call these guys punk . so good music ? listen to coheed and cambria .
2			price	cheap	addition	great			it's elton john . i was looking for a few extra's for my husbands christmas present . he is a ej fan from the 70 s so i thought i would try . i wasn not sure since the price was so cheap . this was perfect . this is the same as the set that is selling for 25 dollars elsewhere . is a great addition to his collection .
2			book	disappointing			unannotated anecdotes . a breezy , and interesting collection of information about the presidents . the contents match the title exactly , no surprises here . this makes fun light reading as one can stop and start whereever one wants . unfortunately the book is disappointing in that these anecdotes , while quite interesting , are rendered useless for citation since the author did not document his sources .
2			i	glad			100 okamoto crown condoms . i have to say i glad i bought this only its less embarrassing and the product arrived on time . i love using it . thank for putting this product out .
2			box	extra	repeater	great			extra fios box . using to send fios box signal to workout room . signal is not having to travel far , but it works great and the remote repeater is great . considering getting another box for the other room with no cable right now . very happy overall .
1			wave	new	artists	various	dolls	new	bands	due	rock	hard			glitter mock . wham , bam , thank you glam ! various artists a nifty title for that rompin stompin dumb fun 70 phenom known as glitter this disc hardly justifies the era , spotlighting many acts connected by only the thinnest of threads . any glam fest should at least give due to two of its grandest practitioners , brit bands slade and sweet ; even david bowie , whose suffragette city this disc nicks its very name from , is nowhere to be heard here his services don not come cheap . gary glitters primitive arena thumper rock and roll part 2 the hey song to you sports fans is possibly the only artist here that fits the category well . iggy pop , ex new york dolls screecher david johansen , and patti smith are punk rock pioneers , while kiss , starz , and edgar winter represent garden variety hard rock . that leaves blondie new wave , one hit wonder david essex huh ? ? ? and the exquisitely uncatergorizable mott the hoople . bam , where's the glam ? rating two platform boots
1			film	difficult	it	difficult			wishy washy as one can get . martin scorsese has said that he pulled the camera away from travis bickle as he talks to betsy over the phone in taxi driver because it's just too embarrassing to watch . that sense of painful embarrassment pervades throughout the entirety of the king of comedy . it's a difficult film to applaud , but it's even more difficult to damn . the king of comedy is one of those films that weeds out the less vigilant viewers among us . it's the story of an obsessive going after his desire a career in comedy ? or just a moment of recognition ? in the most manic and unsympathetic ways possible . and it does so in meticulous or you might say slow fashion . i felt that watching through to the end paid off for me , the ending made the whole thing worth it . the thrill of the finale is thematic it's not the conclusion to the story , but the question raised that makes this film more than what it see ms still , it doesn not seem like awful much .
1			book	hate	writing	hate			no story line . i really hated this book . i hate stephen king's writing , in general , but the book has no plot line . it's like a description of a day in which nothing in the afterward , king even says he thinks lots of people will probably hate disappointing .
2			resource	great	points	popular	book	great			a great resource book . this is a great book , it has actual photos with the meridians drawn over top of them . the downside is all the points along the meridians are not specified , only popular points for certain conditions . the other great book to compliment this one is called accu cat or dog etc , which has drawings of the meridians with each point indicated .
1			hit	total	performer	worst	person	biggest	song	decent	metal	heavy			the beginning of the end . no prayer for the dying was the last quality maiden album . even though they sounded old and tired every song was decent . fear is a total hit and miss affair . a first for maiden . a crack in the armour that has only gotten worse since the unspeakable horror that is blaze or whatever that singer's name is . don not even get me started on gers . the biggest long haired person that ever strapped on a guitar . not only are his guitar solos utterly horrific he is the worst heavy metal performer in history bar none . prancing around the stage like a long haired ballerina in tennis shoes . i saw them on this tour and the arena was half full . in the 80 s the same arena was so packed you couldn not movean inch . alas , a sign of the times . nirvana and co . single handedly destroyed our beloved 80 s metal . bruce saw the writing on the wall and bailed out just in time . btw , his solo albums arelight years ahead of the stuff maiden put out after this one .
2			voice	glorious	singing	good	singing	vocal	treat	real			lets beat out some love . ms etta jones sure does beat out some love on this two for one fact im listening to it right now . what a glorious voice this lady has / had . i have all her muse / highnote versions of classics become her very own . good vocal jazz singing never gets much better than this . if you havent discovered ms etta jones then u are missing a real treat . sadly missed , however the voice will linger on .
2			i	thrilled	beep	tiny			so happy with product . this is the second time that i have ordered this battery for my ancient nokia phone . i was thrilled to find it and also that i could purchase 3 for less then half the price of the one i purchased previously . i love my phone and want to keep using it for another 10 years . now i have all the batteries i need . when i recieved these . {long transit time} the charge was not even showing and i was in fear that it would not charge . but after 3 or 4 min . a tiny beep and then it charged . {all 3 of them} it took only about 4 to 5 hours for a full charge , but i left in the other 2 over night . i am using one now in my phone to test the hold of charge . so far , its working great . been several days of constantly being on and so far its great .
2			it	huge	surfers	young	nooo	big	wednesday	big no	wednesday	big			big nooo huge . the story behind big wednesday is one of life and sorrow . the lives of a handfull of young surfers in california and the effect that the changes of time have on them . from the war in veitnam and struggles of growing up in that ere ! the comedy and facts of this film blend together to make one of the most intense storys of the 60 . big wednesday is not big it is huge .
1			it	like	classic	real	hopkins	great			a so so movie that could have been a real classic . i saw dracula and afterwards i felt letdown about it . having seen bela lugosi's version i was hoping it would be like that unfortunatley it wasn not and here's why i think it wasn not as good as the above . i found that keanu reeves and wynonna ryder to be miscast in thier respective roles who they play i won not say just watch and see what i mean . also i found gary oldman to be a little weak as dracula in his potrayl he didn not seem to scare me at all . the only person who i feel saves this film is anthony hopkins who's great in his role who he plays i won not say but i m sure you will agree so all in all i can not recommend dracula .
1			vocals	terrible	disasterpiece	true			a true disasterpiece . definately not , ev's best work . vocals were terrible , but the phat beats kept me listening . they are still my girls though !
2			depth	compelling	prose	beautiful	reviews	previous	gem	little	observations	compelling			brilliantly written autobiographical essays . previous reviews are accurate about the quality of this book and the content , but neglect to mention that it is an extraordinary work of literature . ms lindbergh has composed a series of memory reflections she consciously eschews hyphenations like that but i don not know how else to say it , connecting each to the next like a string of pearls . the prose is beautiful , the depth of detail always just right , the psychological observations and self reflections are compelling , and though her book is more thematically focused , i would rank it with arthur miller's timebends among brilliant autobiographical essays . a little known gem of a book . and look at that cover photo !
1			it	free	cage	huge	movies	bad			glad i have prime and it was free . wife is a huge cage was torcher to watch . i would have given less than 1 star if it was i went to the dentist instead of watching this movie . i have seen some bad movies but this one now has the honor of been the wor st .
2			storylines	great	mods	awesome			jak 3 reviewed . jak 3 is my favorite from all the jak games . the gun mods are awsome . you will find out who the precursors are . the boss are battles really more gun mods , desert buggies , ghaphics , leveled out difficulty and great storylines , get 2 gun mods right only 4 boss battles , alittle to much buggy ,
1			fantasy	classic			a classic fantasy , and the greast tale ever . a story that will leave you speechless . bilbo baggins will make you beleve in magic again . a fine prequel to the lord of the rings .
2			buy	great	condition	new	one	new			perfect bang for the buck . this was a great buy ! the book was almost new condition for a fraction of the price of a new one . everything was there and couldn not asked for more .
1			pictures	worth	photos	terrible	point	basic	adjustments	significant	one	old	point	old			bought as point and shoot , not that simple , blurry and grainy in all but perfect conditions . bought it as a point and shoot camera , but without significant adjustments , it was very blurry and grainy . it still takes terrible photos at night or with any of the settings but iso . bought it to replace an old basic point and shoot , but the old one is better all around . in fact , if we hadn not brought the other camera with us too on our last trip , nothing but daytime pictures would have been worth keeping at all !
2			paddle	cheap	deal	great	motor	loud	price	good			not as convenient as the smaller one , but great deal at a good price . i like this mixer for it's capacity it easily holds 3 cake mixes . the motor is a little loud , much more that my smaller tilt head kitchenaid . my 2 complaints are you can not get the bowl off without removing the paddle & that gets a bit messy we are a bakery & actually use this repeatedly . and , 2 the paddle is definiely cheap . it seems to mix good though & i bought it for about $ 250 with a $ 40 rebate yet to be seen . so , for around $ 200 i don not think you can go wrong . i would never buy this for over $ 250 though i would rather have a tilt head one .
2			it	hate	you	warm no	music	modern	people	nice	mcgregor	excellent			those funny french fairies . . well ! i avoided this one like the plague , just couldn not accept the concept of dove tailing modern music ala madonna , elton john , etc into the vivid world thank you john huston the 1952 version of whores , pimps , dancers , singers , drug addicts , alcoholics and one or two nice people . if you have moved through that area blanche , pigalle , sacre couer , duvallon you will recognize it ! you will either love this crazy movie or hate it you cannot be luke warm about this one . myself ? naturally loved it , cannot get enough ! it's brilliant dvd strategy an experience unto itself , a super 2 disc set with extended dance sequences , etc etc etcalways versatile , nicole kidman vividly reminds one of rita hayworth or is it moira shearer ? but she still owns satine a rare beauty . an award winning performance ! ewan mcgregor is also excellent as the naive love intere st bravo baz luhrmann !
1			albums	best	fan	big			come on . . . we know back in black was one of the best albums in we really need some experts to tell us this ? i m a big ac / dc fan i would not buy this .
2			mouse	specific	it	comfortable	clicking	constant	mouse	best			best mouse available . this is the second logitech g 7 i have purchased . and , this time i only looked for this specific mouse . i have used many different types and styles , and have found this one to be the most reliable by far . it fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and is so comfortable . i don not get hand pain from trying to hold onto a mouse that doesn not fit properly . it comes with two batteries so you never have to wait . one battery is always being charged in the charger also included while you are using the other . the lights on the top of the mouse show at a glance how much battery time you have left . the batteries pop in and out in a matter of seconds . i use this one at work where i am always on my computer . i used the first one at work also and it lasted about two years before i literally wore the left button out from constant clicking . when my mouse at home which is a different style logitech finally kicks the bucket , i plan on replacing it with this style .
1			problem	big			not quite good enough to buy , worth a glance . this is one of the poorer dummies titles , for the first big problem is installing linux . if you were attracted to the format of this book , then instead wait for linux secrets with cdrom by nabajyoti barkakati list price $ 49.99 which leads you by the hand in a much better way , but get the suse installation to go with barkakati's forthcoming october 1998 book . the only worse book you could buy is linux discovered
1			they	good	thing	good	it	slow	parts	best			not so good . this book took forever to get to the best parts . as some of the readers said tanya took forever to make her mind up as to what she was going to do about her cheating husband . although i never expected the to find out those other things the pastor did , it was still a little slow for me . i read one of mrs , roby other books and that was better than this one changing faces i purchased too much of a good thing , and the best kept secret at the same time hoping that they all would be good books to read . from the looks of casting the first stone , i m not looking forward to reading the other ones . overall i could have save my time and money , i killed time reading it but i would have rather reading the newspaper . sorry !
2			it	quick	value	great	movies	great	zoom	powerful			awesome . great overall camera value for the money . shutter lag is a problem , and it's a bit inconsistent . sometimes it's quick , other times it can take 2 -3 seconds . i love the powerful zoom , and the unit takes great movies .
2			recipes	great	it	educational	recipes	good			very educational with good recipes . i have had this book for about 2 years . it is very educational and has great recipes . i would definitely recommend it .
2			story	excellent			excellent book for all ages . this book was required for my children's literature class . just about everyone in my class liked this book , and their ages range from 18 years old to 60 . i liked all of the poe ms this story would have been excellent if it wasn not in poetic prose , but the style hess used enabled the story to be told in fewer words that had more meaning . another reason i liked the poetic prose is because there was a definite rhythm ! it made me feel that billy jo was telling us her story through piano playing . some of her songs were happy , and some were sad . luckily , this is one story that disney will never try to make a movie out of . i recommend this book for older children up through adult .
2			it	great	it	hard	episodes	individual	menu	main	core	hard	i	amazed	it	cumbersome	quality	good			so bad it is great ! i love the red dwarf series . always have , always will . this is the collection for the hard core dwarf fan . the video quality is very good and the extras provide some added fun . the only negative of the dvd collection is the main menu for each disk . it is cumbersome and hard to use . so , i guess it is a perfect fit for the premise of the series . i am amazed how many individual episodes i had never seen through years of watching the series when it aired on tv . i hope you get as much enjoyment out of the set as i continue to .
2			delight	new			people in glass houses . when i read chuck k . i feel like i m coming home . it's like i m having a deep , intense discussion with a college friend as dark side of the moon is tripping in the background . i mean , i am a gen x rawker about the same age , and with every page comes a new delight . when he mentioned all for leyna , a track on billy joel's glass houses i about busted a was my first vinyl at age 9 chuck and i are soulmates . if you don not like his stuff , you just don not get it , and you weren not there .
2			cg	amazing			alice in wonderland . the cg in this movie is amazing . my boyfriend absolutely loved this movie for it's querkiness . the movie itself is somewhat of a trip . johnny depp's character was somewhat like his character in charlie & the chocolate factory . the plot had an interesting take on the story , much unlike the other cartoon version . my boyfriend loved it and loved the bluray version .
1			shape	great	it	new	themselves	wrong			harry potter book 2 . the book was in great shape considering i bought it new , but the pages themselves were wrong it goes from page 228 to 331 and then repeats whole section againg still missing about one hunderd pages worth of reading
2			feels	comfortable			excellent product . excellent well . quick price . . elderly mom feels very comfortable with them , they are the only ones she will wear always
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			quality of plot and writing continue their downward trend . i found this book , and the other 2 in the series , to be poorly written . i have enjoyed her both her pitt and monk novels , but this series seems almost to be by a different author . i find the style in which she hides the identity of the peacekeeper and his associates to be particularly annoying . the action seems to consist of people driving back and forth , and thinking , and changing their minds , and thinking more . there does not seem to be much investigating just suspecting someone for a while , then suspecing someone else .
2			it	worth	pun	basic	software	real			realbasic for dummies with cd rom . informative , but needed more in depth coding examples . after reading the book cover to cover twice , i still felt unprepared to do anything more than an extremely basic no pun intended application . i would have like to have seen a little more programming examples of the concepts presented . i definately would recommend this book over the tutorial from real software . it is worth the money , but dont expect to be an application wizard after reading it .
1			system	hate	system	new	appliance	electronic	sound	bad	task	huge	sound	terrible			this phone system is a nightmare ! i hate this phone system with a passion . i did not buy it from amazon and wish i did because i would return it in a second . the manual is over 100 pages . this is the most complicated electronic appliance i have every purchased . it makes my computer , stereo and television look like childs play . i can not imagine how they could make a phone system that takes a 100 page manual to use . examples of my problems turning off the a huge task . i read the manual for an hour an could not figure it out . finally it took ten minutes on the phone with siemens to walk me through how to turn the handset ringers off ! i still can not figure out how to answer the handset when the voicemail picks up the sound is terrible on the handsets ! if you plug your head set into the main the phone the sound is also bad . i m telling you this phone is the wor st i m buying a new phone system today once i m done with this review . then i am going to take a hammer to this phone !
2			reviews	outstanding	bass	acoustic	you	lucky	performer	real	songwriter	fantastic	end	low	end	high			ear candy ! holly cole has some outstanding reviews in the audio press and listening to this cd one understands why . this is one superb recording . if your audio system is high end this performer is palpably real , right in front of you . the acoustic bass will test the low end of any system . the harmonica riffs by howard levy will send chills up your spine . ms cole's cover of tom waits material is a compliment to this fantastic songwriter . if you are lucky enough to own tube audio equipment , buy this cd . if you are a sound fanatic , get the import . reference sound !
1			waste	complete	actress	best	voice	good	picture	best			migrane rouge ? moron rouge ? call it what you will moulin rouge is a complete waste of time and only suceeds in giving the viewer a splitting headache have some asprin on standby , you will need em . how this film was a multiple oscar nominee with best actress and best picture among them i will never know . nicole kidman overacts frenetically , as does the rest of the cast , though she has a good singing voice and she does look gorgeous throughout the movie . however moulin rouge rates 8 10 on the vidiot's cringe meter . by the time you hear the rendition of madonna's like a virgin you will be ready to break your tv set .
1			music	great			. c mon , this stuff is a drag ! if you have to acquire a taste for this stuff , then it hasn not hit you right off , which is what great music does . no waiting for the effect . great music says hello ! ! 's time for sleep ! one reviewer compared this to dark side of the moon , but at least on dsotm , pink floyd had the sense to add the alarm clocks to stir you . closing time music for the droll and lifeless . one star out of pity ! !
2			something	available	i	lucky	fingers	great	toy	outstanding	item	original	jeep	new	jeep	huge			gi joe new jeep for 12 inch figure . i got the canvas top on it and it is an outstanding toy , yes it is a toy , plastic it is and breakable . i looked everywhere for a jeep for the 12 inch gi joe and if it's used it's broken somewhere and scuffed up . this jeep is an original item , with the canvas top it looks magnificent ! it is for my grandson who is named just joe after his daddy who is in the navy reserves and the figure looks just like his daddy . also , the figure has great moveable fingers so he can grip anything . only using guns to hunt down play dinosaurs . very expensive , but nobody else has an item like this . very happy i spent the extra $ 100 for it , it is for christmas so what the hek ! i have looked again to see if something like this is available , nothing like it yet is on line , very rare item , the jeep is huge ! i was lucky to find this for my grandson joe .
1			gun	bad	day	next	problem	big no	i	excited			bad gun . when i got the gun i was all excited , i took it out of the box and the first thing i noticed was that it smelled like dung seriously i took it out and shot it a few times it seemed next day i started shooting it again and inoticed that the range had somhow decresed to like 30 ft no joke . then after that the orange tip broke off not a big problem but than when i shot it againits range had gone down to 25 t . also the scope is just a tube with plasticcrosshairs . the gun is cheaply made and i would not buy it .
1			ir	correct	correctness	political	correctness	bad	spirits	great			really bad political correctness . this looks puked on . even i voted for bush , unlike those losers who made this sh ty movie ! so tell me again , why did somebody make this . ir is way too politically correct . it is man is evil like , it is environmentalist , it has the great spirits from above , and it has music which no one in the right mind will like , especially not love . now anyone who likes this should have their butts dropped off , and so should the makers .
2			album	accessible	brilliance	musical			something to listen to alone . new to the dots ? this is perhaps their most accessible album . cva reaches into the melodic past and foreshadows what is to come . a blend of cascading , musical brilliance and impending doom creates a mental image both astounding and terrifying . lpd is the music to play alone . if you are fond of depth in your music , buy this cd !
2			rapper	best	cd	hot	music	hot	you	suck	cd	best			best rapper of live since the best rapper retire . i have been reading some others reviews and was shock that some people wasn not feeling it . this cd is hot and anyone who doesn not like this cd is a fool . weezy killed is this cd . this is his best cd . i love cashmoney , but some people are now opening their ears and are really hearing wayne on this has been spitting since the beginng . their isn not a rapper who can touch lil is my favorite rapper . if you like hot music this cd is for you . and for you haters you suck .
2			favorite	personal	record	historical			tale of two relationships . this album seems to be a sort of historical record of the breakup of costello's marriage to cate o riordan and his subsequent meeting and becoming engaged to diana personal favorite is still . it is a lovely ballad that is heartwarming and makes you feel what is in his you liked his recording with the brodsky quartet , you will thoroughly enjoy this as well .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			don not bother . this is just a retread of the badly written dbi docs . plus you have to deal with the authors egos , and their peculiar insistence on calling their creation the perl dbi and not just perl dbi . an irritating and useless book . read the man pages .
2			judge	ultimate	story	typical	twi	classic	stories	short			perfect stories for bedtime scares . i thoroughly enjoyed these short stories . they are the perfect length , each about 10 to 15 pages , just enough to build up the story and knock it over with a classic bradbury twi st my favorite stories for far are the burning man , which asks the reader to reexamine his or her own prejudices in the setting of a typical lone road hitchhiker horror story , and the perfect murder which shows that time is the ultimate judge and jury .
1			walmart	local	receipt	old			overpriced . this page selling slimfast is linked from their corporate web site . i expected to find prices that were competitive with my local walmart . the price per can at my walmart is $ 0.75 a can . the price in this site is $ 1.56 a can ! ! what a rip off ! i was actually going to order from this site until i got an old receipt out from my wallet and did the math . ill stick to buying them at the store for now until the prices come down online .

2			mix	best			drinking the stuff for over twenty years . hands down the best protein mix of all time . smooth and great tasting , only go with vanilla . don not mess with it if it ain not broke .
2			writing	beautiful	it	hard			lovely . three junes is a lovely read , one that begins strongly and only gets better . the story concerns a scottish family and begins in june 1989 paul mcleod , recently widowed , takes a tour to greece , contemplating his future , his past , his family . jump ahead six years and we are in scotland , where paul's three sons are preparing for his funeral . jump again four years , to eastern long island , a weekend get together with two of paul's sons and fern , a woman paul met on his trip to greece . it is hard to do justice to this novel in a few pithy sentences . the writing is beautiful and glass gives us characters we can care about deeply . their lives are complicated , but without any melodrama or pyrotechnics . her writing is simply beautiful and i believe gets stronger as the novel progresses . i thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful novel and highly recommend it . enjoy .
1			me	mad	monster	real	waste	total	disappointment	great	i	mad	brother	little	book	good			just plain bad . funny how if you don not agree with the minority who are hyping this book you are some kind of monster . the real monster is this book . i can not for the life of me see why anyone would say this is a good book . and yeppers do my little brother was crying too with great disappointment after spending his monthly allowance on them books . me i was just mad as heck . it is a total waste of time . not worth it .
2			read	great			great read . easy to understand and follow includes how to handle finances and make money work for you ! you could read this in about 2 3 hrs and then at the end say that is how you do it
1			son	old			a disappointment . my 5 year old son loves to watch the blue's clues tv show , and we have the blue's clues treasure hunt movie . but the computer game leaves a lot to be desired . when you first start the game , steve does a lot of talking so much so that my son asked , is all we get to do is watch ? finally we get started , but there is still too much waiting in the game waiting for steve to talk , or catch up . also , when you are doing the activities , you don not know how long you have to do them to earn the clue . finally you quit the activity in frustration , and there's the clue waiting for you . after this happened a couple of times , we realized we can do the activity as long or as short as you want , and still get the enjoyed playing going on the treasure hunt , but at times we shut down the game because we were frustrated and didn not want to wait any more .

1			talent	little			while i agree with the majority of what sykes writes . while i agree with the majority of the viewpoints in ms sykes book , it gets tiresome . about halfway through the book , the soapbox format gets old . it takes little talent to write in such a perscribed format .

1			cloud	main			zzzzzzzzzzzzz . ok , i just got a ps 2 and i didn not have any games for it so i looked at the bestsellers that were in my price range , and i ended up getting ff 7 well i popped it in and started it up . 5 min . later , i was fast asleep . this game was made 5 years ago and a lot have changed , but all the characters looked like blocks running around . when i woke back up , i tried saving the game , which wasn not possible for me because i didn not have a psx memory card , so now i have to start from the beggining every single time . now for the storyline , what is it ? shouldn not you know what it is at the beggining of the game ? the main character cloud i think his name is , seems fairly ignorant . and the setting that he runs around in makes it hard for you to see where he is most of the time , some stages make you wonder why it's there . i don not suggest buying this game , do something better with your money rather than buying this game .
1			closeness	emotional	reviews	negative	boots	black	sonnets	visual	cover	beautiful			oh dear ! i have to agree with the more negative reviews . the cover is indeed beautiful , but the content , with exceptions such as brian peterson's work , tends towards high heeled black boots and the burlesque . it seems as though fetish is now the order of the day , with erotic photographers following this very standardized path like sheep . trouble is , the photographs tend to depersonalize and objectify , which robs them of their erotic quality . if making a statement about the objectification of women is the purpose of much of this work , well ok , but how many artists should it take to make the point ? a missed opportunity . take a look at judy francesconi's visual sonnets or , from the 1970 s , frederick smith's sappho the art of loving women as alternatives . to me , these speak more of a belief in the beauty and emotional closeness of the relationships depicted in their authors images .
2			movie	great	movies	best	memories	great	me	wrong			one of the best disney movies ! this movie is really great ! i loved watching it when i was a kid . it brings back so many great memories for me ! i still think beauty and the beast is the best disney movie ever ! this is still a great movie as well , do not get me wrong ! one of the classics !
1			problems	serious	remedies	natural	pills	large			mediocre . i don not think this product works very well . then again , i have serious sleep problems and have kind of surpassed a lot of natural remedies . so maybe it is just me . i found these to be mildly relaxing but not necessarily sleep inducing . also you have to take several four and the pills are large . i wouldn not buy again .
2			woman	new	newcomer	exotic			gripping drama . this is the tale of a womanizing , henpecked husband who escapes the wrath of his wife's vicious tongue in the arms of another woman then finds himself in a deeper mess as he falls for an exotic newcomer in town . however , this new woman will have nothing to do with a divorced man leaving him only one alternative dismiss his lover and murder his wife . a suspenseful drama ensues .
1			grooming	professional	emphasis	heavy	voice	average	singer	good	humility	little			simply awful ! this disc was simply a waste of my mediocre songs , heavy emphasis on sex instead of talent . corey's voice is below average . i get the feeling that corey clark is imitating a good singer with a viable career , and not doing it very well . clearly fake it till you make it isn not working here . the songs all sound the same , i kept waiting for something to get me grooving , but it just didn not happen . i think his ego is much larger than his actual musical either needs voice lessons , a little humility , and some professional grooming and i don not mean clothing .
2			bit	little	season	little	rd	excellent			this season was a little . wei rd cast was excellent , though minus one . it was a bit abrupt , and you can feel the loss in the dynamic of the crew a little bit . the entertainment is still there , and the cast does roll on . you will have fun with the season , once it gets moving .
1			storyline	boring	outfits	ok	prom	bad			rubbish ! this movie was apsolutly rubbish ! the animation wasn not good at all , and they say they have as passion for fashion , hello did you see the clothes they were wearing ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ok well the formal outfits were ok , but the rest of them were just plain and boring , my wardrobe is more fashionable than storyline was a bit boring but you did get an unexpected suprise when you discovered it was and i noticed that the people at the prom , before the girls arrived , were just standing there and not doing anything . if the prom was bad before they came , wouldn not the teacher have done something ? ? so over all , don not buy this . save your cash for something better .
2			hit	real			finally a board game without the bickering ! i bought the yoga garden game two years ago and i have used it sparingly in my children's yoga classes , especially when only 2 -3 kids show was a real hit when my montessori classroom did a unit on games and play around the world . the children automatically gravitated to it and loved it ! i taught some children how to play it , and they picked up the rules perfectly . the older children would set the board up on thier own and show the others how to play the game . not once did i see them fight over the peices or the rules . they really enjoyed it and i would recommend it in the classroom !
2			step	next	value	great			great value buy . the price / value is what is driving my 5 star review . best you can get for this price . works as advertised and gets the job done . the next step up in quality will cost you almost twice as much . if you are only going to be using a drill like this a couple of times per year , go with this .
2			usage	heavy	weight	good	it	nice	factor	nice	indicator	little	you	low			not bad but could be better . i have had the g 7 for about 3 months now and my thoughts are pros nice form factor . it fits in the hand really well . there's a good weight to it so it flows quite smoothly on my corepad adjustible dpi on the fly . this is great in fps games like bf 2 when you want to switch really quickly interchangable battery system . it's nice to be able to switch out the battery when you are low so you are not stuck recharging your mouse in a dock when you forget to recharge cool little battery indicator on the mouse . lets you view your charge level at a battery life ! ! omg , these last maybe 2 days at the best with light use . if you play some bf 2 forget it , you are changing the batteries every day if not more often . even my mx 1000 would last almost a week even with heavy usage only one side button . come hard would it have been to put two buttons there like every other mouse ? overall though it's one of the best cordless mice out there even with the flaws .
2			finish	strong	fusion	addictive	guitar	electric			the fusion is addictive . this fusion of the 16 h and 20 h centuries is very addictive . from a layman's perspective , it was a bold venture that required exceptionally talented musicians and a conductor / director who could think in the abstract . since i do not have any formal education in music , nor can i read music , my commentary is based purely on listener satisfaction and not on any higher understanding that might accrue to those who are prominent in the music field . when the electric guitar took charge about three minutes into track 8 i concluded that the cd is priced too low . track 7 starts out deceptively sedate followed by a strong finish . having heard the cd from beginning to end at least twenty times , i would say that there is no inferior content .
1			i	disappointed			did not last . i bought this model kt 2651 ww epicurean 6 qt machine for myself as i have been drooling over getting one for years . i used it 3 times for christmas and then pulled it out this year to find it does not work . it does not even turn on . i am really disappointed ; it does have metal housing and feels like a workhorse but wants to be out to pasture way before it's time . i am in process now of attempting to get it repaired or a motor to fix it myself .
1			ring	black	it	cheap no	i	happy no			leaks when pouring coffee . the silicone that holds the black plastic ring at the top broke loose and now coffee leaks out everytime i pour coffee . it happened a month or so after i purchased it so now i m stuck with it . i might try to fix it myself , but i m not happy with this considering it is a mr coffee carafe and not a cheap knock off .
1			condition	great			no dvd in case ! the case came in great condition but there was no dvd inside . please help ! please send the dvd .
2			things	best	rice	flat			wonderful cookbook ! discovery of the pressure cooker has been one of the best things that ever happened to me as a cook . i regularly serve these dishes to guests and they almost all universally love them . the chipolte chili , andoille w / collards , and the gumbo are all staples in my household ! ! the lamb vindaloo with some modifications to really make it more like korma is restaurant quality and regularly makes it to my table . beans cook in no time flat , rice in less , veggies in less than that . this cookbook has been singularly responsible for me purchasing 3 pressure cookers . i do highly recommend the european 2 d generation cookers . although i have used the old fashioned jiggle top the newer ones are just so much easier and less fiddley .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			alright . at fir st this vacuum works fine for hardwood floors at fir st after only a year or so with pretty infrequent use , might i add , this thing totally conked out and became pretty worthless . cleaning the floors with damp paper towels was less work and more efficient than pushing this thing around . i live in nyc and see these on the curb as trash all the time . judging from this , i would venture to guess that i m not the only dissatisfied owner .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			so true . for years i have considered myself to be a freak of sorts i consider myself to be a feminist and a strong , secure woman who has a positive self and body image , yet , at the same time , i have wanted to strip . not for money , but for my own enjoyment . in this book , it's explained that there is room for all of us in the feminist movement . it's about time that we as women stop demonizing men and begin to understand that women can be whores or porn stars , or stripers an not be an automatic victim . i found this book to be very refreshing .
2			wood	hard			gator pull toy . daughter loves it . only downside is she broke it after only a few months . it was on a bookcase , she was trying to reach it , it fell off bookcase and our hard wood floors and the back wheel dowel broke in half , so it was minus one wheel . she still played with it with only 3 wheels , it was just a little louder then . 6 months later , the other back wheel broke off so it was down to 2 wheels . she still plays with it ! so only 4 stars because it can break .
2			belief	popular	its	greatest	music	nice	version	superb			i just so happen to like corey clark . contrary to popular belief , i like this album . i m not saying that its the greatest of all time or anything , but is very soothing to the ears . the music is very nice and goes well with corey's falsetto . generally , i have a 3 song rule in regard to whether i should keep a cd or not and fortunately , i like most of the songs on this cd . in spite of the corey paula controversy , paulatics is one of my favorites on this cd . i thought corey's version of all this love was superb to say the lea st if u are in need of hearing some smooth grooves , i highly recommend corey clark !
1			product	bad	ati	old	drivers	horrible	cards	functional			bad product . horrible drivers . i purchased this product to upgrade my old all in wonder ca rd i love ati for their wonderfully multi functional cards but they really need to do a better job of writing software for them . i tried to install this card on windows 2000 with all the latest drivers and with the exact instructions after reading another review here for each driver . the end result was video with vertical lines on both the dvd player and the tv software . spent 4 more days trying to fix the problem but just gave up in the end and went back to my old ati ca rd i might try the radeon 7500 in the near future since i suspect that the dv output of the card had something to do with my problems .
2			price	reasonable	i	amazed	pen	brilliant	it	beautiful	quality	high			exquisite . this pen is brilliant . i want a pen for office use that had class and beauty and made of silver , so i went to site to site looking for a high quality pen with a reasonable price and finally came to this site and i was amazed of the craftmanship and the price , so i was skeptical , but i took a chance and when it came i open the package and it was more beautiful than i could a imagine so yes i recommend this product it has class and beauty and you won not regret .
1			it	true	book	entire	love	great	it	worth no	book	great			yes , it's the comic book is much better ! yes , it's true this movie is terribly made . and like most everyone else here is saying , i agree that it's not worth watching or renting . even reading the comic book before seeing this movie doesn not help , because it's so far removed from the book that it's insulting . i can understand that in an hour and a half film it's not possible to capture the entire comic book it would really take a mini series to do it properly or at least a 2 hour epic with a frank miller sin city , 300 budget , but they did things that weren not even in the comic book ; things that make the comic book so great . i definitely wouldn not use this movie to judge the comic book . everyone who was disappointed with the film should search out the collected trade paperbacks of the faust comic book series to see how great faust love of the damned truely is .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			almost horrible . grammar mistakes that lead you to wonder exactly what they are attempting to say , not systematic in explaining all the parameters / options of a command / function , and only skimming the surface of many concepts . save your money , there's got to be a better book out there .
1			one	worst	ink	bad	bucks	big	bust	total	one	old	penn	poor	surprise	big	artist	professional			flimsy is the only word that comes to mind . i have been using rotting pens made in germany for 15 years this was the worst one i ever held . cheap quality for big bucks ! the inner tip is bent and it shreds paper into cotton , the ink cartridge takes 2 minutes to get into to refill . cleaning the heart is almost impossible . and the ink is blotchy and gray ! possibly the one i ordered was old but with poor quality penn it came as no big surprise to have bad ink to a professional artist this was a total bust , for someone using this for handy pen for notes , it might be wary of sellers , when buying this item . mine did not communicate at all , and refused to give me refund even after the pen was returned . i had to file a z and pay return shipping . not what i would call satisfying purchase in any way .
2			areas	important			thank you kate o beirne ! this book tells it like it is . an excellent read about the evils of feminism that's been long overdue . o beirne doesn not hold back in her efforts to debunk the feminist perceptions of victimhood that negatively effect many important areas of our lives . well researched , well written , and highly recommended .
2			food	necessary	pictures	unique			the animals learn about the importance of being kind . this book has a wonderful message about being kind to others no matter how small or insignificant we might think they are . the animals do what is necessary to secure food . their country is in a famine , and one tortoise helps provide for the key necessary to eat from the only tree providing food . they forget who helped them get the food , and selfishly try to eat only to come to their own ruin in the process . the pictures are unique in their african geometrical designs , and add to the overall folklore of the story .

2			game	entire	rpg	best	weapons	powerful	it	great	graphics	stunning	it	old			a must for any gamer with a playstation ! i hope every person who has a playstation has this game . if you dont then get it . this is the best rpg ever . even though it is 2 years old it is still great . this game provides challenges and lots of fun . you can be amused by it for 70 hours at lea st the graphics are stunning . when you summon a creature from the vast aray of them you will be in awe . to complete the entire game is almost impossible considering how you need every advantage availible to defeat the powerful weapons . i would recomend this game to everyone whether you have a pc or playstation !
1			drummer	great	album	next			i feel the same way . i thought i was the only one thinking the same way about this band's music ! while the drummer is great , the singer is not anywhere in the same league as lisa gerrard from dead can dance but she does have a pretty voice . everybody seems to like this band a lot but , frankly , the cds quickly get very boring and repetitive . gee , i wonder what their next album will sound like .
2			cause	good			i can not wait for it to come out ! i have watched the whole series on cartoon network and none of them were good cause of the cuts , now i can watch them , all of them , uncut ! ! i give that a . yea ! !

2			bra	great	store	famous			great bra , recommended by the best . this was the day bra suggested to me by the amazing staff people at bra tenders , a famous bra store in nyc that caters to broadway performers . i definitely thought it was too pointy when i first tried it on , but then once i put a shirt on top i realized that pointy perky looking breasts . it is now my go to bra and i own many of them . i definitely recommend it i m a size 32 or 34 .
1			it	loose			walkabout . received this dvd and it was loose in the box . it would not play . i returned the dvd to the address on the mailer . very disappointed .
1			feels	cheap			a nightmare . i bought this phone through a supplier via an online travel site . this phone is an absolute nightmare to navigate . now that most of us nowadays text instead of talking , the a 70 makes it absolutely near impossible to do so . the phone feels cheap . what is worse is that depending on your provider , a phone call costs 2.00 usd or 80 per text ! if you are considering using a phone abroad , do not get this . a piece of junk .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			phenomenal book with lasting re reading value . i am biased . this is my favorite book , but still . it is incredibly well written . heller weaves this story dynamically , playing with time and character perspective with a dry , biting wit . i love it .
1			depth	limited	movie	good no	bullock	cute	self	normal			not good . this is not a good movie . neeson is so wooden , even when crying , he should be standing in front of a cigar store . bullock is her normal chirpy self , cute but with limited depth . the premise is misguided , and the writing and editing perfunctory . all of the actors can be seen in better performances elsewhere . save your money .
1			space	little	book	professional			too much in too little space . i am a systems administrator trying to set up apache running on a network . i have been trying hard to cope with this book for simple installation and configuration procedures but in vain . after desperate efforts , i picked up the kate wrightson book and i got everything set up in a snap actually 3 days of fruitful reading . thumbs down to the professional apache 2.0 book fortrying to cover too much in too little space .
1			one	expensive	product	new			where's the box ? i have yet to use this product , but i was quite shocked when i got this in the mail . i ordered one from circuit city last week and wanted another one . this one from netbargains was more expensive but circuit city was out of stock . this one came wrapped only in bubble wrap along with the cd and a copy of the installation instructions . i thought i was buying a new product . no where on the site does it say its not new in the box . pretty sneaky advertising . i only hope it works .
2			writers	historical	people	dead	connection	emotional			the emotional connection . there are many reviews of ms renault's work here already , so i will keep this very brief the reason mary renault is my favorite author is that she can bring the emotional and human quality of her characters to the surface . she makes these long dead people with strange names come alive . she gives them a quotidian life . she makes them human , and humane . true , her knowledge of the ancient greeks is encyclopedic . true , her descriptions are wonderous , but her deep empathy for the people in her novels is what separates her from other historical writers . she also handles homoeroticism / homosocial behavior with a sweetness and sensitivity that demonstrates the value of the delicate bonds that men should be encouraged to explore and nurture . her compassion for the human experience is sometimes overwhelming .
1			growls	horrible	scenes	complete	cut	original	school	high			don not let the director's son do any more edits ! i bought this not noticing this was the director's son's edit . i hope the director's son never edits another movie again ! the edit was something a high school child could have done on his i mac . scenes that were once complete now end abruptly and jump around , mouths move with no dialouge , horrible growls were added to fight scenes . . the list goes on . i plan to sell this back and wait for the original cut to be released in the us .
2			space	little			bio dome . aerogrow aerogarden indoor gardening kit with gourmet herbs blackgreat for anyone with little space .
1			information	little	while	little			waste of money . i found this book on special for 5 australian dollars so i picked it up . i didn not get around to reading it for a little while but i should have never bothered in the first place for a few book is too focused on the american economy and had very little information which could be linked to australia's the first page it presented itself as a very bland read , giving barely any encouraging information for anyone wanting to expand on their finances . i stopped reading after the second chapter as it just had no appeal to me . i do not recommend this book at all .
2			it	nice	one	new	it	hard			my favorite album of all time . i m a music obsessed person . so it's hard to pick one album as my favorite of all time , but this one is definitely it ! i broke my copy sometime last year and i was devastated . i just got a new one thank god ! and it was so nice to be able to listen to this album again . u 2 definitely needs to get back to where achtung baby took them . i love them on this album , and if they need a sound to come back to , this would be my pick !
2			points	good	laughs	enjoyable			not bad at all . at first i wasn not sure if i was going to like whole concept of this film seemed a littletoo unbelievable , and , by the end . i was enjoying it ! hero makes a few interesting points , that we as the public never think aboutwhen it comes to the media . are we always watching the heroor someone who just took the credit ? does the media focus too much oncertain icons while others are left behind ? aren not we all heros in some way ? surprisingly , this was an enjoyable laughs , some tears & some good points ! an over looked hoffman flick . where's my shoes ?
1			author	greatest			stray from derleth . like the watcher out of time and innsmouth clay this book is entirely written by august derleth . derleth studied the works of lovecraft but never did he write in collaboration with the master of horror . august derleth's first story wasn not written until the early 1950 s . howard philips lovecraft died in 1937 august derleth has many failed attempts at immitating lovecraft and prints lovecraft's name on the cover of all his books because if people knew that derleth wrote the stories , they wouldn not buy a single copy . if you wish to read horror by the greatest horror author of all time , be sure to check the coyright lines for each story . stray from the failures of derleth and follow the guiding light of lovecraft .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			did i even end up using this ? the professor for my class in which i used this book didn not refer to it very much . i m pretty sure i only opened it up a few times . i don not think i can provide a very accurate review . i am sure if one were to read through it , it would explain the different data structures and their implementations in c very clearly though .
1			i	satisfied no			unsatisfied . i purchased this book intending to recieve it within 21 business days , however the book never came . they have notified me that they must have recieved errors at their warehouse . they gave me a full refund . but i am not satisfied because i wanted that book and now they don not even have it for around the same price . i am so frustrated when all i wanted was the product . i still purchase from amazon but just not happy right now with my latest purchase .
2			books	good	student	young	book	best			excellent book . in my opinion is one of the best introductory book in statistical thermodynamics . as a matter of fact , there are a lot of books and even good books treating this topic , but t . l . hill has been able to introduce it in a simple and comprehensive way . in particular , i found particularly interesting his manner to treat the liquid state and the distribution functions part iii . the last part is devoted to quantum statistics , it is an introduction but is well written and for a young student will be enlightening .
2			it	good	page	next			one of the best ever . after i read the book the catcher in the rye it gave me a certain feeling , that i had never felt before while reading a book . i had spent the better part of ten years looking for a book that gave me this same feeling when i read it , but none of them quite did the job until i read angelas ashes not since the catcher in the rye has there been a book so poinigent and well written , and that would make you laugh out loud on one page , and then hold back tears on the next page . i cant wait to read not is i just hope it is half as good as angelas ashes
2			songs	great	while	best	dc	classic	while	lyrical	talent	total			top album for some classic ac / dc . this one definitely displays ac / dc at their lyrical best while laying down some slammin rock . great songs and wordplay ; total talent displayed here .
1			character	main	english	senior	book	worst	americans	native	dribble	liberal			this publication should not exi st worst book ever ! kingslover destroyes and dismisses all of the characteristics that create a decent novel . this book is devoid of any plot or driving force for the main character to face . kingslover has the uncanny ability to spend hundreds of pages , for a main character to dream and wish of a past that she clearly never had and cannot reclaim . as pointed out by a friend of mine during senior english the year myself and others were forced to read this atrocity , all of the lessons that one could possible come away with from this book are present in the disney film , the lion king . remember who you are , and remaining true to your past , all of which are present in a kid's movie . i would reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys , reading about horny native americans , and 300 pages of liberal dribble so humanity shan not forget the electrical engineer who died in latin america . to quote comic book guy worst book ever !

1			riddens	good	plank	total	films	worst			tremors 4 the legend begins . this is one of the worst films that i have ever seen . it does not even come close to the class of the 3 d one , never mind the first hour went by and i could have easily been mistaken that this was not a tremors film , with hardly no graboid action at all . michael gross , as hiram , is a total plank , nothing like the bert we all know and love . i have just thrown this dvd into the bin and good riddens .
1			heats	normal	player	portable			audiovox 1680 portable dvd player . i recently purchased this product to use for airline travel and for use in my motorhome . i played dvd's and cd's and found beautiful sound and picture quality . however after only 3 uses the unit completely stopped working . discs would spin intermittenly and not load . i loved this player when it worked but i m afraid to try it player heats up with extended play which manufacturer says is normal but it may contribute to the breakddown .

2			book	great			compass a handbook on parent leadership . great book on raising children . just wished i read this book before i had children !
1			book	worth no	they	bad	job	good	terminology	basic			another fast book ? object databases for oo beginners why ? if you don not already know and understand the basic object terminology explained in this book , you probably don not need to start with a book on object databases . i would also read the reviews of this author's other books . they are mostly very bad . this author seems to write more book than anyone could write and do a good job even if they wrote fulltime much less if they taught college as this author claims to . this book is probably not worth the money or your time .
2			classic	best	mystery	classic	acting	great			classic mystery . this story will keep you guessing what's to happen next until you see who the villain is . then you won not be able to wait to see how revenge is dished out . a best classic in every sense of the wo rd great acting , actors and photography !
2			lee	great	movie	good			a great lee marvin . marvin at his there are so many holes in this plot it looks like swiss cheese ! is lee's character a ghost or not ? and first one thinks so but then ambiguities start to appear . and just who is keenan wynn's character ? how does he know so much ? and after all those initial murders on alcatraz don not you think the authorities would have closed it down & why would the mob keep using it as a drop off point ? but in 1967 who cared ? a good movie to see while trippin . get it for lee's performance !
1			it	important	seems	ashamed	publisher	major	seems	pathetic			so engrossed in sex as to be indistinguishable from porn . i picked this book up because of my interest in the beats , feminist literature , and the american immigrant experience . i was disappointed on all three counts . first , the only thing beat about it is the era depicted , though i think it is far more about 1969 the year of its publication , than the 50 . secondly , writing explicitly about sex does not make a writer a feminist just because she also happens to be female . it merely makes her a female pornographer . thirdly , what little is mentioned of di prima's heritage seems somehow pathetic and ashamed . too bad . i doubt i will go on to read other di prima work , but i suppose there must be something there in order for her to have been so highly regarded . this book is a waste of time and money . how was it picked up by such a major publisher as penguin ? could it be that important an artifact of the 60 ? it offers us nothing of the beat generation , and is an embarrassment to it .
1			anything	new	tip	little	configurations	detailed	information	detailed	someone	new			very basic , generalized . not much there . if you have used apache without even reading about any detailed configurations , you would still not see anything new in this book . i can see this book being a little useful for beginners , but even then , it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs / additions . i can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem . i picked it up , well , because i buy every o are illy book that comes out seriously and thought i might be able to find something interesting , useful or that i wasn not aware of or forgot . maybe even a little tip about efficiency , compiling options or just anything of is no more useful than the readme and install files that come with apache's source code . i m not sure i want to even give this two stars come to think of it . i just don not see the point to this book . a let down coming from o are illy .
1			sound	great	it	compatible	battery	new			great until it breaks down . like a couple other reviews , i loved mine until it broke . returned it under warranty and the second one lasted also only about 13 months and dark screen after a few minutes of play time with a new battery . i will try an pioneer airwave seems that it is compatible with the lancing docking station which i already own and has great sound . save your money .
2			it	hard			non stop wwii action . the scenario and the plot seem somewhat improbable , but given the premise the author takes off into an action packed novel . this is the sort of book that can be read in an evening , fortunate because it is hard to put down .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			lovely , lovely book . the combination is a winner because of the stunning page and a half photo spreads of australian desert and scenes showing robyn's trek with the camels engaging narration by robyn that shows you the beauty , fear , boredom , and other feelings that accompany her on the months of solitude crossing 1700 miles of outback australiathe photographer represented national geographic , and the photos have that look the magazine readers expect . interesting panoramas , the light playing on the spinifex , the wrinkled face of an aboriginal tracker , the otherworldly red dirt , the camels silhouetted against the skyline . robyn represented only herself and undertook the trek for reasons even she did not understand . seeing her develop and expand her thinking during the days and weeks and months on the track makes this a fascinating book .
1			it	bad	elizabeth	hot			glad i didn not buy it ! from the moment this movie started i could tell it was going to be a dud . sure enough , that's how it ended up . the only thing i liked about this movie was some of the costumes / effects that were used for the monsters and such . however , the acting , storyline and just about everything else was a major let down . i gave this movie 2 stars for the simple fact that shannon elizabeth was in it hot , and that some of the costumes were nicely done . don not waste your money on this one , it's so bad you can even spot camera men and guys who hold the microphone boom in several shots .

1			parts	original	bands	extra	set	worthless	wings	extra			worthless . ridiculously fragile falls apart . the skyblades deluxe boxed set is absolutely worthless . within 15 minutes it will be in pieces on the ground . the younger kids will run off to do other things while the older ones stare at the broken rocket in semi disbelief . the construction of the rocket is so shoddy that the manufacturer includes repair parts in the box . the repair parts consist of extra wings , which are made of a very thin , styro foam like material , which cracks after one or two flights , and some extra rubber bands for engines . the rubber bands seem to break as easily as the wings . of course , the repair parts are no better than the original parts and the whole thing is in pieces within a few minutes .

2			films	italian	american	italian	movie	worth	girl	little	movie	good			the violent professionals . i have seen and liked several italian crime films some i have liked others i haven not . the violent professionals came to my attention because an beautiful car i love is in , for an couple of minutes but it's thrashed chevy powered corvette engined iso 's the silver car , besides that which for me is the highlight of the movie , the beautiful italian american hybird not the hybrids of today yuck . the movie has plenty of car chases and action , there is two parts that made me want to give the movie one star the scene with the little girl and then later the scene with the pregnant 's disgusting . the movie is slow paced at times but it's an good movie with an interesting plot and twists . i saw this instantly online i believe on youtube the whole thing . i am going to buy it , cause it's on dvd i have seen and it's not $ 40 $ 100 which is ridiculous . movie is worth watching , one of the better of the genre .
2			work	true	work	important			profoundly spiritual and profoundly practical . i want to give a copy of this book to everyone i know i kept having that thought while i was reading the book and moreso now that i have finished it . which means to me , that i should not give it to anyone but to apply the ideas contained in the book in my own life . true work is as important as anything that joseph campbell has written . it comes from michael and justine tom's own life experience and contemplation of that book shows how to integrate work into one's fabric of life , because work is one of life's threads , but it is not the whole cloth . again , it is a profound work .
2			price	good			would buy it again . it's taken a beatin and keeps on tickin . was a pretty good price for the quality as well . highly recommend
1			anecdotes	personal	seemed	good			too much extraneous material . disappointing reading . there is some interesting information here , but it is mostly at the end . before you find it though , you have to go thru a lot of personal anecdotes in tedious detail and other interjections of questionable relevance . a pity , because some of the ideas and explanation seemed good , but in need of fuller treatment .
1			farce	total	me	interested	him	clear			without ledger this would have been total farce . long , boring flick . ledger alone kept me interested , every other part of this movie stunk . what the heck was with batman's voice . get that man a butter menthol or at least make him clear out the phlegm . he sounded absu rd
2			it	helpful			very practical . the skills taught in this book can be used from the day i read it . although there is enough number of books analyzing abuse , this book is different because it is so helpful in coping with life for adult children like me .
2			stores	local			perry . my son & i searched all around for a webkins platypus . it was a manager at a target store that suggested that we check online . we found amazon to be very easy to use , simple to locate the webkinz we were looking for & actually after shipping costs were added cheaper than all of the local stores . webkinz googles

2			something	expensive	look	good	they	small			for $ 3 it meets expectations . got someone who likes turquoise ? they will probably like these chip earrings . i saw from a few other reviews that some people were dissatisfied with the color of the turquoise . i didn not have that problem . i gave these as a gift and the girl liked them ; she thought they were probably around $ 10 so i suppose that's a win for me . i can not comment on how durable they are , but they look pretty good when she wears them . they are a bit small , probably you only get 5 or 6 chips per earring , but they work for a simple accessory . if you want something a bit more elegant and a bit more expensive i would recommend these sterling silver double oval drop earrings . thanks for reading
2			reader	right			quite astonishing . i found this book to be quite astonishing . while i used to be extremely skeptical of the so called ufo's this book introduces facts , accounts , and inferences that have lead me to question my own beleifs . excellent book ! although , i think that a reader was right when he said that ufo ology is not a word , however i don not think he read the book .
2			story	great	book	fabulous			read this book ! i know that this is the latest in a long list of glowing reviews for this fabulous book , so i will make this short . this book has it all . not only is it a great , complex story with wonderfully developed characters , but it is exquisitely written . not in a long time have i come across intellegent prose telling a fascinating and exciting story . it is my absolute favorite book ! i highly reccommend it for everyone

2			world	entire	bey	pleased			sweet 15 . 5 5 5 5 5 stars gold no greater , it's filmic platinum ! that is all i can say about this powerfully gripping postmodernistic struggle in which entire world's collide , semiotic dimensions collapse , and the friggin universe is flushed with careless abandon like milk down a drain . citizen kane . i saw it . it . nothing can compare to this film with the possible exception of gymkata but that's like comparing god to jesus . they are one in the same , and both are excellent chefs . i think that this film should be the staple of every indie film buff's library , with it's undercurrents of existentialistic philosophical squabblings , rousseaunistic individualism expressed in a cunning boroque style , and dali surrealism etched forever into the pallet of my mind's eye . hakim bey and his band of roaming ontological anarchists circa 1985 would be pleasantly pleased and equally plump with the fatty juices of such a masterpiece in film and accordian !
1			it	boring	movie	good	it	long	it	worth			long and boring . i can summarize why i didn not like this movie pretty quickly . it was long and boring , and the antichrist wasn not born until about the end of the movie , and then it was over . nothing really interesting really happened . i felt like it was a waste of time . if you want a good movie about the incarnation of the antichrist , what the omen , it's much more worth the time .
2			debris	fun	it	funny no	debris	funny			really funny and fun too . if you find you can not laugh while reading this book , no amountof explaining will help you . like most jokes , explaining themmakes it not funny . but the next time you hear somethingsimilar you might get it . i do think mr adams needs more practice writing . this was good , but definitly an early work . most chapters had me laughing , and on a few it took me several minutes to stop so i could keepreading . telling a joke verbally and telling it on paper requiredifferent timing , and i think he's almost got it . i m looking forward to more books from mr adams i m prettysure he will improve with practice . god's debris is easy toread , fun and really funny .
2			effects	great	read	great	effects	visual	planet	wrong	school	high			i waited a very long long time ! yes , i was in high school the summer star wars came was the movie of all me and my fellow classmates watch in shock all of the great visual effects , we knew this was a winner . . this is the first time that i actually read the book prior to seeing a movie . i am not going to get into the story plot , because , at this point if you don not know it then well . you landed on the wrong planet , this earth . what i will say is that the book will answer a lot of your unanswered questions from the movie with great read the book . and may the force be with you ! ! !
1			hit	greatest	album	new	comp	best	behaviour	foolish			why roddy ? why ? . my exact exclaimation when i saw that rod stewart was doing an new album of covers . heck roddy , all those tunes were done when you had hits man ! why bother rod ? did clive davis eke you to do this ? rod my friend what about you own albums arent you not remastering the rest of them ? what about foolish behaviour , out of control , infatuation and you best greatest hit comp . the one with the pink outfit ? i guarantee you will sell more units that this sorry state of a rehash karaoke disc .
1			guides	basic	information	useful	questions	medical			useful information but . didn not have much to do with the exam . lots of complex math problems , questions about rockets , medical questions , etc in this book that did not show up on the exam . i spent a lot of time studying this book before the exam and not one question from here was on the te st there were things i had never seen that i had to identify symbols on the test that i wasn not prepared for . i passed the test based on what i already knew but my score could have been higher and i could have easily prepared for the test in a matter of days had i known what type of questions were going to be on it . bottom line if i were to do this over again i would study from basic study guides online . maybe the exam has changed but this book has very little to do with the current 943
1			it	funny	it	right			it's all intro . i kept wanting to fast forward through this movie to hear the comedians tell their version of the joke , which they very rarely did . some of the other reviews have it right , this movie is all about how a joke is told . if you want to watch a documentary on comedy , get this . it's occasionally funny , not all it's cracked up to be .
1			form	vocal	run	average	song	weak			toni's heat is too cold . toni braxtons latest effort the heat is her weakest album to only standout song is the first single he wasn not man enough which i think is still a weak song to say the least , from earlier rest of the songs are just a mish mash of r & b i have heard this before ballads , and mid tempo songs that have no standout potential . always braxton is in fine vocal form , but whatever she does she can not turn this piece of coal into a diamond . unfortunately i think because she lent a writing hand to 75 of this cd , and in my own opinion i don not think braxton is a should do like janet jackson does and have terry lewis & jimmy jam do their job , and if the artist has some input then fine . braxton is a singer , and what a beautiful voice she has , but she is not a songwriter which drops this album to just a average run of the mill piece of dribble . a disappointment .
1			book	boring	sex	interesting no	book	dull	sex	dull	book	interesting no			i agree with kyle . i agree with kyle . this book is boring , dull , and uninteresting . this book reads like a history textbook , only with less information . i can not believe that such a book would be allowed to be published . there are two elements of this book slight hunger and sex . the sex is even dull and uninteresting .

2			killer	serial	killers	bad	killers	serial	killer	good	season	next			could not tear myself away ! can not wait to get the next season . dexter lives with a secret he is a good and lovable , yes lovable , serial killer . he works with his sister for the police dept , often on his own cases that gets interesting and adds to the suspense . he appeases his dark urges by killing bad serial killers . part of the code he lives by is to only kill bad serial killers . dexter is full of suspense and is violent . by using angles along with before and after sceen effects the show avoids showing stuff like knives entering flesh . you will still see lots of blood . a unique show . cover your eyes for the blood sceens , but give it try .
1			package	worth no	point	good	reviews	numerous	substance	little			90 marketing 10 substance . the two disk package is not worth the money ! ! there is very little substance as it relates to game improvement instructions . i was surprise at the lack of game improvement information on these two discs . before buying the discs i read numerous reviews . needless to say , i am more than disappointed in the product ! the one good point is the fact phil has a lot of personality and very likable . unfortunately , that doesn not help my game any . with the hinge and hold technique you will get the ball in the air but controlling the distance and speed is the problem . i would only use the technique if i want to lay up out of very very deep rough .
1			tolerance	high	it	hard			something seems wrong here , like drinking stout in the sun . have you ever tried to like a recording but finally have to just give up and admit you don not ? it's hard to put my finger on exactly what i don not like there is a freewheeling energy derived from a mix of rock , blue grass , and zydeco . the songs are generally up tempo and the band , if not always tight , is after one last listen , the more i realize i will never play this cd again . i don not have a high tolerance for fiddle or zydeco to begin with , so what others might dub infectious , i find irritating , especially when the fiddle is sawing away and the band seems to be going through the motions . something seems wrong here , like drinking stout in the sun . at best one might get away with slipping a track or two on a compilation cd .
1			book	expensive no	library	large			nothing inspiring . this book contains no interesting ideas , no beautiful pictures , no inspiration , and no meaningful journal writing . however , it does contain techniques you probably learned in kindergarten . so unless you are under six , you do not need to buy this book . these authors presumably have created beautiful art at some point , considering their profession as art journal writers and instructors , yet they withhold any and all information on this topic throughout the book . i feel completely betrayed i gave them money and they gave me none of their knowledge . i wish i would have considered the advice of those who rated this book poorly prior to my purchase . although this book was not expensive and i enjoy having a large reference library , i refuse to keep this book as part of my collection because i know i will never gain anything from these pages , now or in the future .
2			tricks	little	it	rare	engineer	professional			excellent production value . as a professional audio engineer , it's rare to find material recorded in the last few years that isn not over produced . this recording caspulizes the essence of the performer with very little studio tricks . a must have for audio engineers , live and studio .
1			family	large	tree	old			aaron spriggs online review for my side of the mountain . i read the book my side of the mountian by jean craighead george . the book starts out with this boy sam gribly who wants to run away from his family with only some flint and $ 40.00 because he feels his family is to large . with a family of 11 i would too . so he goes to find his grandpa's farm . he finds it . and then he hollows out a old hemlock tree for his house . during the course of the book he makes a chimny in his house so he can warm it during the harsh winter , and he makes a couple friends too . this was a kind of boring book . i gave it 2 stars because at some points he sounds like he is going insane because he keeps on hearing his bird talk to him and he talks to himself often too .

1			camper	happy no			not so good . amazon seems to have a problem with color blindness . the picture is for a silver clock but the fine print in the description says gold which i found out later after i received it . i am not a happy camper ! the clock required me to put it in the window to receive the signal . i have a skyscan weather clock that doesn not have this problem which is why i purchased another skyscan clock . the face is scratched and has glue all over it . the 2 center buttons for time zone did not function when i first received it and even after it got the signal and set itself . for some reason it worked once today and i was able to get it to set to central time . amazon was once my first choice for shopping but now i start elsewhere due to overcharging for shipping , incorrect descriptions , and their decline in quality .

1			movies	black			not what it appeared to be . the cover of this dvd shows tarzan standing with a lion . the movie with gordon scott that featured that scene wasn not even one of the five movies . this is definitely not what it is portrayed as being . i was looking for gordon scott movies in color , but these were black and white movies that featured several other tarzans . only one had gordon scott in it , and it was not the movie that was pictured on the cover of the dvd . this was a birthday gift for someone who has been looking for gordon scott tarzan movies for years , and i thought i had finally found the perfect so .
1			i	disappointed	price	high			it wasn not what i expected . i bought this book cause it says that it has many terrific teaching ideas well i don not agree with that , i m not sure that i m gonna buy again another scholastic book , i m very dissapointed with this one , think that the price is to high for this kind of book , feel like i wasted my money , they should sell it as a coloring book . sorry i don not recommend it .
2			affection	real	style	free	work	little	grandeur	literary	way	positive			such a sweet book , filled with innocence and realisation . i loved this book for the story it told and one that i guess we all need to be reminded of , that everyone is linked in one way or another , even those you may never have known or met . everyone has their part to play , even if it's just a cameo role all is book is written in a straightforward , free flowing style . there are no pretentions to literary grandeur or fancy writing styles . it doesn not need them . the sweetness that some label as saccharine is quite touching and poignant . in a word special . i have no doubt that this lovely little work will touch many in a positive and warm way . a book that you have a real affection for .
2			example	true	effects	incredible	man	young	effects	special			movie magic at its be st sci fi miniseries about a young man who becomes a messiah to a group of tribesmen on a desert planet called arrakis . frank herbert's adaptation is an epic presentation , running at 265 minutes long but never dull , boasts fine performances especially saskia reeves , incredible special effects and production values , and exciting action sequences . often awe inspiring , always entertaining and engrossing , a true example of pure movie magic at its be st immeasurably superior to the 1984 david lynch version .
1			pan	little	looks	great	oven	real	seems	true			looks great , burns toa st toaster ovens have never been known for their toast , but this is ridiculous . i can only advise using the broil setting because otherwise the bottom of your toast is burnt before the top is done . oh yeah , the other bonus prize if you use the toast setting you look at it and it's done , you can not just turn the knob and shut the thing off although i didn not force it can either wait it out or remove your toast as the machine continues to toast the other hand , it works quite nicely for tasks in which you use the little pan . frozen pizza and other convenience foods do well here , and the temperature seems fairly true to the stated settings of which there are few . great if you don not want to heat the real oven for a few pieces of garlic bread .
1			instructions	clear no			first alert portable am fm emergency alert radio . cheap and would not buy again . thought seriously about returning the radio but it worked outside . does not work in our bedroom which is where we need the radio at night . the sticker that has the radio tuning stations on it is crooked inside the radio case so tuning is somewhat challenging . the instructions are not clear . i still do not know if the radio has to be on for the emergency alert to sound or if it comes on automatically when set to alert . anybody know ? overall , try to find something with a little more quality .

2			situations	sexual	i	happy	friends	old			amazing ! many books of this length tend to drag on until the reader grows bored and goes in search of another , but i m happy to say that aztec is not among them . the book's thousand page span helps to make mixtli and , indeed , all of the characters , seem less like characters and more like old friends with every page . being only thirteen , it's size deterred me at first , i hate putting down a book once i have started it though once i began i found myself carrying it with me everywhere especially at school so as to get in a paragraph or two before the bell many people have pointed out , aztec is not for the faint of heart . jennings doesn not hold back a bit as he describes bloody ceremonies and oftentimes bizarre sexual situations . these aspects of the book didn not bother me personally , but as they occur frequently in the text , i would advise not trying to simply ignore short , although aztec might not appeal to everyone , i strongly suggest that you give it a try !

1			p	good	film	entire	beings	horrible	way	good	people	rich			this movie left me feeling dirty and not in the good way . basically , this movie depicts rich people as incredibly selfish and horrible human beings . the movie parallels the society of the priveledged to an indigenous tribe i forget the parallel . maybe survival of the fittest or something of that nature . there's drugs , sex with adults and teenagers , murder , self mutilation and sodomy of a teenage boy , need i say more . this was a story of a summer vacation gone horribly did the family stay ? as soon as this movie was over i watched the entire film for some reason , i popped in a feel good movie p . s i love you which was a much better movie , btw
2			material	durable	crusher	awesome			excellent . this can crusher is awesome . it is built from from highly durable plastic material that is evidently wear resistant . i received the item well packaged . i installed it permanently in my garage wall with the provided screws and started crushing cans like never before . this crusher well exceeds my expectation .

1			brand	available	baby	dry no			baby is not dry in baby dry , prefer swaddlers . i have been using pampers swaddlers for my son now 13 months old and highly recommend this brand of pampers . my goal was to order the same brand from amazon but the only brand available on amazon was pampers baby dry diapers so i decided to give it a try , because after all , it is still made by pampers , a name i tru st i do not recommend baby dry diapers . my son would stay dry in the swaddlers but ironically he was soaking wet in the baby dry diapers . the diaper does not hold the wetness which would become saggy once wet and leak up the front , so he would be wet all over , in his diaper , his pjs , and his bedding , overnight in this diaper . he also developed more diaper rashes from wearing this diaper compared to the other one . i love the delivery service amazon provides , but i will not get baby dry again .
2			it	like			wow ! how can a man write exactly what a woman wants to hear ? the notebook is the most sensitive pageturner i have ever read . it captures everything a women ever needs in a relationship . i can only imagine what it would be like to be loved like that . you must read it , if not for the enjoyment then for the experience .

2			hoffman	great	girlfriend	stupid	film	little	you	interesting	impact	huge	seems	interesting no			be afraid of what owns you . this little film leaves behind a huge impact . it is a tale of addiction and failure that will make you ever interesting philip seymour hoffman plays a stuffy bank loan manager who succumbs to the addiction of gambling . he spends weekends in casinos , hides his problem from co workers and his girlfriend and suffers at the hands of his own actions . hoffman is absolutely great in this role ! minnie driver plays hoffman's enabling and stupid girlfriend who believes in the lies more than what is before her eyes . driver looses her savings and her life along with hoffman in the spiral of gambling addiction and is one of those films that seems absolutely uninteresting but is deeply embedded with messages for us all . gambling isn not the only addiction capable of destroying a beautiful and successful life so the mistakes seen in this film can certainly apply elsewhere . mahoney is simply whatever owns you . . beware !

1			it	new			i can let this one go . remembering the hype / publicity surrounding this book when it was new , i found a used copy at a thrift store , stored it on a shelf until now . read it in three sittings , but not because it was riveting . i will give it away to anyone who hasn not read it and would like to . too much fantasy for this reviewer , recipes notwithstanding .
1			theatre	bad	theme	sophisticated	it	cool			bad theatre . it took me a week to watch 1 2 of this movie . i kept falling asleep . i thought it was going to be very cool with a sophisticated science fiction theme and david bowie . perhaps i will watch the rest of the movie someday .
1			children	small no	children	small	animation	good			i did not like this movie . in this movie i want to take out a can of raid . the ants were ugly and nightmarish . the animation was good . but the way the movie was presented turned me off . there are scenes , especially the decapitation scene , that would give small children nightmares . this film is definately not for small children . the movie even made me squimish . plus i do not like woody allen . he always plays a wimpy , whinny nuerotic . hearing woody allen's voice just grates on my nerves . i gave the movie two stars instead of one because the animation was good .
1			it	good	picture	good	sound	horrible	tv	reliable			ok tv , but doesn not fully cut it . i use this to play video games , it's pretty good to use but the sound is just horrible ! there is this buzz while playing , not a very reliable tv . the picture is good , all the inputs are there , overall an ok tv . beware of sound if you really care for it .

1			movie	good	ryan	private	movie	worst			dreadful ! this is the worst movie i have ever seen . for those of you who know nothing about history and are fans of this wretched piece of garbage , i must give you this breaking news the japanese did not bomb pearl harbor to break up a love triangle ! i would say that this movie has all the insight and intelligence of an abc after school special , but that would be an insult to children's television . if you want to watch a good movie about world war ii , don not waste your money on this piece of crap . buy saving private ryan , letters from iwo jima , flags of our fathers , the thin red line , or das boot instead .
1			hums	bible	tickets	black	tickets	compelling	worlds	black	them	hate			love / hate . i love and hate these stories , but mostly . i hate them . maybe hate is putting too fine a point on it . i know raymond carver's wife gushed that black tickets was the unmistakable work of early genius but she and i must have read different books . these stories are , for the most point , pretentious and awkwa rd come on the snowy bible hums ? her breasts balloon , the sky opens inside them ? what the hell does that mean ? i can not even visualize it . kudos to phillips for experimentation , but it doesn not work . i have to say that i do like lechery and evidently so do many others , because it is heavily anthologized . black tickets is also compelling bleak , black worlds these . yet in the end these stories feel thin and undeveloped abstractions rather than gritty experience .
2			it	interesting	one	good	job	good	movie	enjoyable	movie	low			enjoyable tv movie . this movie is a relatively low budget movie , but does a good job of looking into the eyes of the astronauts on the challenger . i personally think that the story is a very good one , and i think it's interesting to see how each person was selected for the mission . i showed this to my classroom of students in preparation for a trip to the buehler challenger and science center , and they really enjoyed this as well .
2			copy	new	copy	hard	penny	extra	hands	readable	book	great			great book but over priced in kindle edition . i bought this book over twenty years ago when it first came out . it is not only a history of the craft of knitting , it is also a reflection of the position of women in american society . no idle hands is scholarly and readable and deserves a place on knitters bookshelves . i like this book well enough that i was thinking of buying the kindle edition in addition to the hard copy i already have . that was until i saw the $ 19.99 price on the kindle edition . spend the extra penny and get a new hard copy it's a lot easier to flip from the index to text .
1			media	good			waste of good storage media . tried to clone a laptop hd to cdrs on a drive that worked fine in the past all cds that ghost wrote to were completely unreadable tested in 3 different systems running mac os , xp , and linux . plus , ghost's actual backup system feels like it should have been phased out years ago , and is in no way easy to use , or to diagnose what went wrong after the software messes up your backups . some software pays for itself , but this actually costs you more as you waste cd after cd trying to get it to work .

2			i	wrong	laugh	good			indescribable . my friend is a cheap -70 s horror movie buff , and i m not . i figured i was in for a good laugh with this one , but i was wrong . i figured i would fall asleep after the laugh , but i was wrong . instead , i didn not take my eyes off the tv until my friend turned off the vcr . not to sound overly dramatic , but suspiria is completely stunning and unlike any of my friend's other cheap 70 s horror movies . i haven not seen photography like it anywhere else ; it's almost like an elaborate , freaked out home video . it impressed me so much that i had to do it justice by writing a review for it . a very strange , amazing movie , whether you get scared or not .
1			light	negative			check boettner's sources . this is an ill researched and prejudiced account of the catholic faith . many accusations , lies , and half truths are jumbled together to try to shine a negative light on catholicism .
2			it	pricey	waste	big	reason	good	it	worth	thing	amazing	thing	nice			fellows ms -450 s . all i can say is wow ! ! corny ? yes , but with good reason . this is my third paper shredder that i have owned and this thing is amazing . calling this a confetti shredder is no exageration , if anything it's an understatement . i have not seen any other paper shredder shred paper like this one . i don not see any way someone could possibly piece your confidential papers back together after they get eaten by this bea st i saw on one review a complaint about paper dust , which this shredder does create . however the only area i noticed any signs of dust after using it was ontop of the shredder , my house didn not get covered with it . another nice thing about this shredder is a seperate slot for cd's , credit card's , etc it also comes with lubricating oil and big waste bags . it is a bit pricey but worth the money .
2			they	available			inspired . inspirational . peaceful . lovely layout . i read from it almost daily and have shared excerpts with friends and family . would purchase more if they were available at the reduced rate i purchased it at or even for a bit more , to give as gifts to a number of friends . thanks .
2			music	good	music	great no			exactly what i was looking for . this cd was exactly what i was looking for . some might say that it lacks good music other than drumming . to put it lightly , duh ! i payed my money to hear the drumming , not great group music .
1			version	new	version	awesome	things	good	alarm	good			brutal , but the new 2500 version is awesome ! i bought the wpa -3000 and it just didn not work for me . intermittent and nowhere near the advertised wireless range . however , i called the company i had bought the product from absolute automation . and they took the wpa -3000 back letting me purchased the dcpa -2500 from them . still made by dakota , but the thing has worked flawlessly for me since i have had it . if you are considering the dakota alert 3000 products take a look at the 2500 s instead . you will be much happier ! also , can not say enough good things about absolute automation . they really helped me out , i thought i was stuck with a no good alarm .
1			it	plastic	you	dry	fit	good	it	comfortable	work	physical	i	generous	plastic	bright	jacket	great			i am being generous by giving this product a 2 star reveiw . this product was cheap , so i did not expect world class rain gear when i ordered it , but even that did not stop me from being dissapointed . the fit is good , and it is comfortable . it also keeps you dry , until it first thing that ripped on mine was the the inner button up flap , this happened the second time i wore it . next , i brushed up against something with the back , and it ripped . currently the buttons on the sleeve cuffs are starting to rip out . the top flaps on the plastic are starting to rip as well . however , since it is plastic , you can use super glue and scrap plastic to repair is bright and it fits good , so that is why i gave it 2 stars . it would probably be a great jacket for use by a construction flagger or someone that does not do a lot of movement and physical work . as a tow truck driver , i have to roll around on the ground under cars and do other stuff that causes this coat to not be satisfactory .
1			expectations	high	character	hard			puzzling . after all the hype , and comparison to camus the stranger , i suppose my expectations were high for this book . i found autobiography of my mother completely benign . in some parts , pointless . unlike camus protagonist in the stranger , xuela's world view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader . a self pitying character , xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white conquerers for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture ; yet , xuela also takes advantage of many emotionally and psychologically . therefore , xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation . i also found nothing sensual about the book the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkwa rd overally , the book does not deliver compared to the hype
1			styles	various	premise	bad no	attempt	hard	book	average	character	dead	it	dead	narratives	separate	book	good			i disagree with most reviews i just didn not like it . i know that i am going against the grain here , but i do not think this is a good book . or even an average book . hotel world was shortlisted for the booker prize and the orange prize for fiction in 2001 i find that very scary . this to me is a pretentious , try hard attempt at fiction . there are five separate , tenously connected narratives written in various first person styles . not a bad premise , but smith manages to leave it dead in the water . the only really interesting section is from the perspective of a dead character . there are a few interesting snippets , but they are mired in boring dross about characters that i couldn not manage to care about i kept waiting for a character to grab me and they didn not . even the attempt at a resolution didn not bring it together . what a shame .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			definitely recommended . i see wild planet as the b -52 s masterpiece as opposed to this debut album like most people , but i still recommend it . despite a couple of clunkers , rock lobster , 52 girls , planet claire , lava , and there's a moon in the sky make this album worth owning . plus , it started off what was , for a few years , one of the weirdest and most offbeat bands in music history at least , for a couple of albums . i don not really see the appeal of dance this mess around though it's a bit grating .
1			i	disappointed	transfer	poor			poor transfer . i was extremely disappointed by the blu ray edition of the third man . the digital transfer is exceedingly poor and the image looks very grainy . the movie is as thrilling as always but the image leaves a lot to be desired .
1			lie	total	packaging	identical	version	specific	issue	true			not a remastered cd ! the word enhanced distorts true issue . this is a warning to anyone that is about to buy this specific version of seventh son of a seventh son cd . it is not a remastered cd ! this issue came from 1998 when i bought mine 3 years ago , it was advertised as enhanced digitally remastered . this is a total lie and a waste of money . the cd you want was produced in 2002 i bought three other enhanced iron maiden cd's and i got scammed on those as well . the packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical . make sure you buy the 2002 maiden pisses me off for putting out way too many repeat cd's of the same material . they use distorted lawyer words like enhanced and make different song compilation cd's . it has gotten ridiculous . fyi enhanced means a couple of videos added . read the cd case and it mentions you should have windows 98 !
1			hdmi	regular	ups	happy			ok . not sure why it did not work for my samsung hdtv and mac book pro hook up . however , it did work for my sony hdtv and regular hdmi hook up . not too happy because i have another better quality hdmi cable that works for both set ups . sticking to the better cable .
2			research	extensive			another good read from robert harris . though i actually preferred his earlier novels this was still quite good . his research into the last days of pompeii and the workings of volcanic eruptions was quite extensive . his key characters were nicely developed . the book kept my attention .
2			bands	best	music	little	music	great	music	happy	moments	greatest	metal	heavy			down comes the raaaaain ! iron maiden is one of the best heavy metal bands of all time . you know it , i know it , we all know it . this album has one of my favorite songs of all time , rime of the ancient mariner . you can just see all the water , you feel like your house is going to flood while listening to it . i love the part where bruce says down comes the raaaaaaaaaaain ! one of the greatest moments in heavy metal history ! no lie ! i just love it when the rain comes down ! four stars cuz it's a little too happy and upbeat for me , but great music for sure .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			night watch is one of the best . although there isn not a terry pratchett book that i don not like , this one is special because we are given glimpses into the early lives of characters that we have previously only known as reader does an excellent job and this is a recording that i will listen to over and over again when i want some humor in my life .
1			battery	expensive	idea	great	batteries	expensive			expensive to maintain . the premier anti bark collar worked well at first and is a great idea . however , i found the battery wore down quickly . the batteries it uses are real expensive . the collar still didn not work after i replaced the battery possibly because the expensive battery had sat on the store shelf for too long . i don not feel i can afford to maintain this collar .
2			cinematography	rich	films	contemporary	drama	good			7 of 10 . one of the better grownup films lately ; good drama , well acted , gorgeous cinema and music . a somewhat plodding pace but the rich cinematography helps a lot . i wish we had more contemporary films of this quality .
1			place	wrong			sorry . coco has always been a generic . why bother buy this cd if you are here in america ? jlo , mariah , etc are making waves . do we really need coco ? nah , i don not think so . if this is the kind of music she's selling then she's marketing the wrong place .
2			compromise	nice	condition	good	card	nice			4 b sdhc card great ! nice card , fast ship , good condition . 4 b is nice compromise between expensive and huge . at this price , could have two or three . very fast , no problem with hd movies .
2			camera	great	brother	big	pictures	great			great camera . i received my 20 last week and have been finding excuses to take out the camera to take great pictures . start up on the camera is indeed almost instantaneous as quickly as you can get the viewfinder to your eye , it's ready for you . being able to use my existing ef lenses was the primary consideration for me and because it costed $ 5 less than its big brother . one minor quibble that i have with this camera is its lack of spot metering . in some circumstances this would come in very handy but 99 of the time , center weighted would be fine . i would strongly recommend the extension grip for this camera . partly because it has the dedicated portrait shutter button and the shutter speed dial but more importantly it extends the grip in landscape mode just a tad bit more . the added height and other features that the extension grip adds more than justifies for the added weight . the grip can also accomodate a second battery .
1			i	little	butt	big			not for big butt's . it is a quality product , deliver was prompt , but so was the return . i m over 6 and little over 300 . the problem was that if i sat toward the rear the two poles poked me in the butt . if i sat in the middle the front post crushed the jewels . so if you don not have a big butt you will find it is a very well made product .
2			he	funny	station	local			great . album ! this guy , larry the cable guy , calls in my local radio station in cleveland , ohio , every now and then . he is sooo damn funny . it's a must buy ! larry your awesome !
2			aliens	long	it	hate	one	best	effects	visual	alien	boring	alien	new	music	good	effects	good	acting	good	storyline	good	ending	good	part	good	lead	hot			the best of the series ! alien was too boring , aliens was too long , and alien ressurection was too complicated ! alien 3 was the best one . it had suspense , good acting , good visual effects , good music , good storyline , a good ending , and a really cool new alien that was faster and more agressive than the others . my favorite part was the ending , and another good part was when the alien burst out of the hot lead that really surprised me ! this is one of my favorite movies and i can not understand why so many people hated it ! and in case you wondered , the picture on the case is the queen embryo that is inside ripley .
2			opener	easy	handle	good	i	pleased	opener	pretty			easy to use . this can opener is not only pretty , but easy to use . it doesn not jump off the can rim and the turning handle is very good for arthritic fingers . i m very pleased with this opener .
2			bit	little	mouse	regular	i	happy			happy with purchase . i broke my elbow many years ago and it was getting painful to work with a regular mouse . this has really helped with the pain . it took a little bit of time to get use to using my thumb rather than wanting to move the mouse around . i m very happy that i purchased this product .

1			lingo	modern	secret	old	pray	little	reminder	constant	secret	good	secret	hard	gift	great	proverbs	mixed	book	powerful	spirit	creative			success ! how do you become a success ? well one start is to read this powerful book the secret of success by r . c . allen . a seminal classic it delves into the importance of faith , the power of intention , and good old hard secret is made up of many steps but the infinite intelligence and creative spirit comes from the use of your brain . it explores some of the tenets of what has become known in the modern lingo as the power of intention . mixed in with some proverbs form the bible , allen delves into living the life you want to lead by moving in the direction of your drea ms prosperity is only a state of mind and if you can dream it you are definitely able to achieve faith , focus , and follow through , a little pray can open the window to the limitless opportunity that the world has to offer . a very powerful book that makes a great gift or constant reminder of what can be done !
1			one	defective			don not waste your money . i had several of these as a kid and never had a problem . this one was defective out of the box ! when i tried to put the rocket on the pump and lock it in place the air pump nipple snapped off and rendered the toy useless . after further inspection i found that the rocket itself was the cause . the plastic ring at the base that attaches to the pump was deformed and would not mount on the pump properly , when i slid the pump lock over the mount it started to bind and snapped the nipple off . i packaged it up and returned it . i may try some of the other models to see how they stack up .

1			fidelity	high	song	great	fans	main			disappointing . this review is for people possibly looking into the beta band because of their single on the high fidelity soundtrack . drying the rain is a great song , but unfortunately the formula that makes it a great song does not carry over to the rest of the album . it really is just a bunch of noise . main stream music fans should pass this up and stick to the soundtrack . trust me .

1			moments	memorable	i	disappointed	one	funny	changes	physical	i	upset	novels	previous			not the best . i was very disappointed by this novel . if i would read it alone , maybe i would have liked it . but i read it as a continuation of the series . i was very upset that nathan does not make an appearance until the end of the novel . i was also disturbed by the physical changes garwood made in the other characters from previous novels . to me , it just isn not a sequel . colin did not seem like himself . even when viewing the book separate from the rest , the character of alesandra is not fully fleshed out . nor is the story believable . i didn not buy their romance for a minute . i can only recall a few memorable moments from this novel one touching , one funny . this is definitely a novel to borrow but not to buy .
2			picture	good			excellent . no problems with installation with vista the driver on cd comes with the quickcam , after 5 minutes everything was working . the picture is good .
2			twist	new	addition	good			a different bit of suspense . i usually enjoy any bruce willis film , as he is indeed a very talented actor . i thought this was going to be just another action film , but the story line was a new twist and the movie holds your interest well . alec baldwin is a sincerely menacing meanie cold hearted to the core . only alan rickman could have played it crueler . a good addition to my collection , and i am sure i will repeat viewing from time to time .
1			cop	liberal	slant	liberal	season	great	civilians	hate	guns	bad	it	annoying			preachy ; liberal slant . season 1 was great and i couldn not wait for season 2 i m about 3 4 through season 2 now and found it to be slanted and preachy . in particular , ep 9 iron pipeline & ep 10 swamp thing . ep 9 oh noes guns are bad ! unless cops have them . apparently if you are a liberal cop that hates civilians having guns , you get the freedom to assault a buff dude buying an ak in a sporting goods store . that's ok , it's probably just because he's some back country redneck , so all is forgiven . which brings us to ep 10 how many times did they snidely refer to swamp rats ? hey , those rednecks are dirty and live in the swamp shootin animals and not buying their meat at the store . git em ! ps please stop asking the question why do {you / they} {need / want / have} insert firearm ? it is annoying and not a valid question .
2			role	interested	me	satisfied	ending	happy	ending	realistic no			all woman magnolia . excellently acted by all three actresses . juliane moore shines in her role as a 50 desperate housewife . her role particularly interested me because of the similarity of the story lines with another movie she appeared in which was magnolia , which also included john reilly who played the policeman in magnolia and her husband in hours . magnolia is another screenplay that involves the lives of people and the way their paths interact . in hours we are treated to a three generational story about how a book causes this intersection . in magnolia we see many more intersections all leading up to an unrealistic ending the frog shower . in comparison , magnolia did have a somewhat happy ending . and both films left me totally satisfied .
1			it	due	timing	bad	knowledge	limited	execution	boring			maybe the most over rated book of recent times . it's perhaps due to my limited knowledge of mythology , or maybe just bad timing , but this was a waste . read in 92 i still wonder what i m missing , given all the hype back then . banters on and on , and probably written while in herringbone . couldn not help but feel that taken by his own heightened self importance . premise is sterling . to me though , the execution was brutally boring and tautologous . i m certain that we are all better off reading the classics themselves

2			layers	dead	concern	huge	skin	thick			more like miracle stick ! i have the most stubborn plantars wart and after about 2.5 months of applying this every night , my wart has finally gone away . it doesn not hurt at all , as the acid just kills the upper layers of the skin cells . i would recommend taking a shower or at least getting the wart moist with a washcloth so that the medication works the be st i left it on over night and just applied it with a q tip with the end cut off , then covering with a bandage . killing some of the surround skin was a huge concern , because in my opinion , the skin on your foot is thick enough to withstand it . while i don not know if i would recommend it for everyone , i used a cuticle clipper to cut away the dead layers of the wart so that the medication would be able to kill the wart faster . when i didn not , the skin wouldn not peel off like it would for some of the other reviews , and it worked fine .
1			res	high	photo	great	graphics	weak	res	low	images	compelling	they	available	photos	superior	i	willing			not worth the money . i second the other reviewer's opinion . i bought this before seeing that review . the graphics are weak and outdated , and where i had expected a library of images i could just copy and paste , you have to go through their software to insert images into documents that you produce using cosmi's software . if the images were high res or visually compelling , i might be willing to fool with it , but they are not . the stock photos that come with ms office i don not know if they are available in all versions are far superior , even if the selection is mode st better to have one great photo than many low res uncompelling images .
2			toy	great	grandson	old	link	weak	marbles	large	i	concerned	hit	huge	lessons	good			fun . this was purchased as a birthday gift for my 3 year old grandson . it is a huge hit ! he initially needed help for the consrtuction , but has learned how to build a structure himself . good lessons in cause and effect , planning and physics are learned when delight in this toy has not lessened the thrill of the noise and the marbles running brings smiles to him and his younger sister and his dad ! i am a bit concerned about the longevity of the necks on the pieces that hold them together may prove to be the weak link . but the hours spent running the marbles will , hopefully , be manyone issue the marbles seem to be smaller than some available on the market . we had some marbles that were too large to run the race ! great toy !

2			it	difficult			hard to say . it's difficult to review a product that you have only been using for less than a month when it is advised to take the product for three months minimum . my s . o . and i have a dr's appt on monday so we will see how well it worked !
2			story	solid	dvd	ok	performances	good	thriller	good	film	good			good 70 s thriller with olivier and peck . the dvd is ok , but other than that , this is a very good film concerning the pursuit by an aging nazi hunter , played by laurence olivier , of dr josef mengele , played by gregory peck . good performances and a solid story concerning mengele's attempt to create clones of hitler and bring about the return of the third reich .
1			dell	new	looks	good			don not buy this product now . installed ver 8 on a new dell xps 400 it ran very slowly but i did create a music cd from a download . the video editing did not run right from the beginning and downloading an update from roxio did not help . when i run the software it starts ok but then stops responding . the computer then takes 5 minutes to shut down on a restart . left a service request on the roxio website 2 days ago . still waiting for response . this product looks good on paper but my advice is to wait until they get the bugs worked out .
2			cryptopsy	best	production	incredible	i	sorry	vocalist	best no	bands	greatest	everything	clear	skill	legendary	quality	musical	he	tight	piece	fantastic	drummer	best	it	cool			cryptopsy's best . ok , harcore cryptopsy fans , i m sorry , but this blows none so vile away ! and thats saying a lot , seeing as nsv was a fantastic piece of work . however , on this album , cryptopsy really perfected thier sound , with mind blowing musicianship and unmatched brutality . also , mike disalvo is a vast improvement over lord worm . lord worm had a very unique voice , and it was cool in the sense it sounded truly inhuman , but it lacked any sort of musical quality . disalvo is not the best death vocalist either , but he works very well for the band , and his voice fits right in with the brutality . the production on the album is also incredible ; everything is crystal clear , crunchy , and pummeling . but lets not forget the most amazing aspect of the band flo mounier ! he is possbly the best drummer death metal has ever seen . he is incredibly tight , technical , groovy , fast , intense ; his skill is already legendary . as long as this band has flo , they will forever be amongst the greatest bands in death metal !
1			book	disappointed			very disappointed by the content of the book . i read through the 500 formulas and thought the 556 formulas would be a better book , very disappointed on the content of the book .

1			story	predictable	story	good	she	concerned	writing	best			irritating . . frustrating . . barely tolerable . indeed the weakest of the kay scarpetta novels when did kay become such a whiner ? predictable story line i have figured out the plot by chapter two of each of the last four books ; where's the plot twist ? the red herring ? the surprise ? the thrill ? i threw the book across the room when i read she was stealing their beauty in aggrevation . cornwell's writing used to be edgy and gritty . now it seems she is more concerned with churning out a book a year rather than being a writer with a good story to tell . her editor also fails to rise to ocassion it's ensure not insure . as usual , the ending is rushed . the best writing is the goodbye to benton scene . i want the postmortem and all that remains caliber back . . please !

1			character	main	turnoff	real	books	previous	mindness	high	grade	little			preachy , preachy , preachy . kate shugak is getting more and more arrogant and more dislikable . the mystery seems insignificant in comparison to stabenow's seeming need to preach . the book is about 100 pages longer than her previous books and most of it can be attributed the preaching arrogance of the main character , kate shugak . her arrogance and high mindness are a real turnoff . for example , she disses all people in organized religion as not being able to think for themselves , declares all states that end in a vowel to be redneck states , disses all music that she doesn not like , and if someone isn not enjoying the outdoors in the manner that she doesn not see fit they really don not deserve to be outside . it is all just a little too much for me ! this will be my last kate shugak mystery . as an aside , the love angles are just a little 8 h grade for me .
2			escape	famous	history	entire	tales	classic	escape	greatest	detail	rich			the greatest alcatraz escape and more ! the famous motion picture escape from alcatraz drew inspiration from this collection of classic tales . this classic is reasonably comprehensive in scope , bruce hails in his understanding of the inter workings of alcatraz . overall , i found the writing style and prose of the author engaging . bruce's account details the escape with depth and the entire history of alcatraz in modest but rich detail . the book was written during the time of the escape in 62 and while not written as a straight chronology , it offers the reader details that are particularly pivotal in the history of alcatraz and the historic sequence of events . highly recommended !
2			book	black	books	important			chilling . one of the most important books of the 20 h century . this book documents each baby step towards totalitarianism . just at the black book of communism illustrated marx's communist manifesto , rise and fall of the third reich documents fascism in action . this book is a chilling read . i could not finish the chapter about the human experimentation that was conducted in concentration camps . this book shows in vivid detail the dangers of concentrating all governmental power into the hands of a single man . no single man is more worthy of the hell he now resides in than adolf hitler .
2			book	little	tibetans	native	it	fun	strip	little	script	tiny	print	little	book	great			oh , what a great little book ! i just love this little book . i haven not got to travel to tibet as of yet , but i do attend teachings at a drikung kagyu monastery where i interact with a few native tibetans . i must admit , i usually chicken out when it comes to trying to really speak . but it is soooo fun to be able to find words and phrases that i already know from practices and be able to see them in other usage . a terrific book ! ok , one thing , the print , especially the tibetan script is tiny , but then there is so much info crammed in this pocket sized book , who can really complain . if you have a hard time with little print , throw a little reading magnifier strip in your pocket with it

1			smells	awful	yes	due	they	difficult			unhappy . this cupcake set smells awful ; whether it's pvc / vinyl or other kinds of awful chemicals , i actually became nauseous after opening these from the horrendous smell . they are extremely difficult to put together / take apart , and both of my daughters and myself are frustrated by this . i have been looking forward to this set becoming a part of our play kitchen , and now i m a bit afraid to let my daughters play with this due to the awful smell yes , i washed the pieces as instructed they still smell . i would return this set , but it's too much of a hassle with amazon . 2 thumbs down
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			cheap and useless . this product did not work when we put batteries in . it had so much static that you might not be able to sleep with it . i did not return because i checked it beyond the 30 day return period . recently two months into using it , we have no been able to use this crap at all . it produces a loud static and does not work . i had to sleep in my son's bedroom for fear that i am not going to heat him when he wakes up .

2			harmonies	great	material	original	music	original	material	great	cd	great	town	small	coa	central			folk duo's latest is a masterpiece . when i first popped in behind the blue into my cd player i was driving through the rolling mountains , pines and aspens of teller county , colorado in a small town called florissant . i was already enjoying the scenery when wendy's voice hit me like a bullet of light . what an album of great original material . the llamas at the llama farm i passed even perked up their ears . this album is a well crafted and intense collection of original folk music from the king and queen of folk on california's central coa st guitars , mandolins , great harmonies , cellos and mandocellos . this album has it all . wendy's lyrics are so thought provoking it makes you wish you had written them . great cd . get it or you will be missing out . five stars ! ! ! ! ! ! !
2			children	young			wonderful cd by raffi . this cd has some wonderful songs that are a lot of fun to listen to , especially who built the ark , shake my sillies out , and sambalele . my only quibble would be , as a teacher of young children , that many of the songs are pitched out of the range of children's singing voices , making it difficult for them to sing along . but all in all , this is a fun cd that children love .
2			way	great	machinery	heavy	it	durable			backhoe loader . does your boy love tractors and trucks and dumptrucks and bintrucks graders and car transporters and bulldozers and well you get the idea . well this is a great way to get up close and personal with the detail of the backhoe loader without getting covered in grease or in trouble because mom does not want you playing on heavy machinery for obvious reasons . but you can play with it . my 2 year old would sleep with this thing if i would let him and it is durable enough for him to do so . but mom said , number

1			movies	good	movies	bad	plot	great			the movie ok . i liked the movie and the fact that it doesn not have a lot of gore in it , but still a suspensful horror . i really thought the plot was great but as a stephen king freak , i would have to say that i would only place it in the middle between the good and bad movies of king .
1			i	disappointed	i	glad	i	surprised	photos	nice			toxic substance in non toxic recipes . as another reviewer has mentioned , almost every one of the recipes in this book uses sodium lauryl sulfate . this substance is a well known allergen and one that no member of my family can tolerate . we must diligently read labels on everything from shampoo and toothpaste to headache remedies to avoid contact with this ubiquitous irritant . i was surprised and disappointed to see it listed as an ingredient on page after page . i found this book at the library , and i was very glad that i had not purchased it myself . a waste of money as far as the recipes go , although the illustrating photos are nice and the author's comments about attempting telepathy as a means of insect repellent are amusing .
1			quality	poor	artifacts	visual	copy	old	equipment	current	film	original			disappointed . bought this dvd because of the spectacular scenes and audio and wanted to see it on current home theater equipment . quality was poor , with detectable video camera jitter and visual artifacts typical of an old copy of the original film . no fbi warning , so my first thought is that maybe it's a chinese copyright infringing ripoff ? ?
1			direction	positive	souls	poor			run away ! i watched the clip 23 minutes in hell and was changed for life . it was worse than any horror movie i could have seen . instead of helping me in a positive direction i felt an extreme heart pull and sickness in my stomach for the poor souls that suffer there . i do not recommend this book to anyone ! ! the lord does not work this way ! ! this is evil ! !
2			movie	new			movie review . movie was is good new like add had said , but works well . should word advertisement differently so no misunderstanding
2			i	wrong	trip	recent			i liked it . i bought the nokia n 800 internet tablet because i didn not want to carry my lap top on my recent trip to taiwan and hong kong . it has served me well during my travel . i used it to access my emails , handle my stock accounts , lookup any info on the internet while i am traveling . 50 of the time i could not get the wifi connections while on the road , except when i am in a coffee house , but i am sure this situation can be improved over time . while in the hotel i used a travel router which allow me to connect to the hotel's etnernet system . i also used the skype for all the outgoing calls which saved me a lot of money . i thought by letting it to hibernate would save the charge as if i actually turning it off , but looks like i was wrong . i need to do more test on the definition of working mode vs standby mode .
2			it	soft	it	sturdy	toy	great	grandson	old			grandson loves it . just got it today and my almost 16 month old grandson loves it . i feel the design makes it really sturdy because he can push the sides down etc . and it will pop right back in place yet it is soft enough so that he won not get hurt on it either . ordered more balls , since 50 is not enough . overall i think it is a great toy and will keep his imagination growing .
2			man	young	story	basic	story	similar	boston	southern	images	visual			a screenplay devoted to challenging the mind , heart , and sou . this screenplay penned by matt damon and his pal ben affleck is both immensely heartfelt and beautifully scripted . its dialogue is extremely well thought and intelligent . this is extremely evident in the conversations between will hunting , a genius janitor with a sad family history , and his psychologist , sean . it's setting of southern boston is also a beautiful addition to the visual images the screenplay plays in our minds . the basic story about a young man trying to cope with family pain is somewhat similar to the film ordinary people . this is a piece of riveting literature not only for hollywood honchos and box office bullies , but also for people who enjoy a wonderful story .
1			story	stupid	focus	main			raving fans a revolutionary approach to customer service . the author could have put his main focus on a 3 5 card , but instead wasted paper , ink and my money on a stupid story involving imaginary people . i expected more from a business oriented book .

1			cd	bad no			so , so . this cd is not bad at all , i was just expecting more since from a swedish death metal band . thunderbeast may grow on you but at first its not that enjoyable and nothing really catches the listeners attention . i recomend night in gales towards the twilight first and then give thunderbeast a try but don not expect to blown away by the cd .

2			things	good	insider	worth	film	fantastic	docudrama	great			great docudrama . i had come to expect good things from michael mann after seeing heat and collatoral , and had heard that the insider was also worth watching . i heard right as it is now my favorite film from mann , the story is based on fact about one man who dared to go against the tobacoo company and lost everything because of it . one of the films many strengths are the superb performances by crowe and pacino duh , they seem as though they could be the actual people who went through the ordeals of all this . half docudrama half psychological thriller this is a fantastic film not to be missed ! my rating 9.5 10
2			lamp	great	lamps	great			great lamp , versatile uses camp , bike , flashlight . all around princeton tec makes great lamps . i have had the eos for about a year and the tec quad for several years . the eos has a better pivot mechanism that holds the lamp in place . the older tec quad is a bit looser where it pivots , but it is likely this has been resolved on newer models like found on this eos . this lamp is more of a spotlight , if you need a softer more dispersed light , check out the quad .
2			stewart	solid	novak	beautiful	rest	solid	cast	great			great cast , ok film . kim novak is beautiful as usual , jimmy stewart is solid as usual , jack lemmon steals every scene as usual and the rest of the cast is solid . the story is not the strongest ever filmed but not that hard to watch . this predates bewitched but you can see some of the similarities . on a cold night with nothing else to do you might enjoy it .
2			arrangements	good	example	good	noveau	big	arrangements	nice			good example of late 90 s ferguson and band . nice arrangements and ensemble playing from big bop noveau in this latest recording . fergusons tone is full and he can still reach the stratosphere when he wants to . good arrangements by tom garling and ron oswanski make this a pleasurable listening experience .

1			ai	frustrating	graphics	nice	luck	good	feel	frustrating	them	alive	fan	huge	team	stupid	enemy	boring	ai	constant			one of the lamest rainbow six games ! as a huge fan of clancy games , i mistakenly bought this one . the graphics are fairly nice , but the on rails feel and constant not rigger point ai is frustrating . the ai is some of the worst i have ever seen in a game . your team is so stupid you will want to just keep sending them back to the start point to keep them alive and out of your way . the enemy ai also becomes boring in how they always do and say the same thing over and over . i turned the game difficulty all the way up , and it's still just a yawn festival . online verses play is fun , but good luck finding anyone out there ! don not waste your $$ or time on this one !
2			helper	valuable	considerations	heavy	work	important	care	legal			the pill that goes down easily . tender legal care by susan dolan is a precious and important work . it very lightly assists one through heavy considerations . her gentle guidance steers one through the inevitable minefield of anxiety we face , simplifying a complex task . as a physician , i have observed tranquil deaths of those who have prepared themselves for the inevitable . this is a very valuable helper . j . vizzard , m . d .

1			effects	special	worthy	musical	cd	exciting	cd	inspiring	worthy	great			a disney spectacle ! this recording proves a lot of things . first of all it proves why ragtime should have won the tony , because with out the bright costumes and special effects , you have this album which besides endless night are all recycled songs from a cartoon movie . the ragtime cd which i highly recommend , is much more exciting and inspiring even just to listen to . a great musical worthy of a tony winning should not rely on special effects , and should be just as affective as if the cast were in street clothes which applies to ragtime
1			effects	special	course	direct	hole	black	film	little	effects	good	cloud	huge			a dull plodder . astonished humans watch as three klingon battle cruisers are destroyed in a huge cloud which is on a direct course to earth . and so james t . kirk and crew are sent to deal with the threat . unfortunately , for most of this film very little happens . it seems to be aimed more at 2001 fans than 'star trek fans . the characters are rarely allowed to show character and some of the dialogue is pretty stupid it disappeared down what they used to call a black hole . who exactly talks like that ? good special effects and a wonderfully atmospheric score save this film from being a one star . thank goodness the makers of star trek 2 onwards knew what the series was supposed to be about .
2			it	interesting	images	powerful	confrontations	dramatic	masters	grand	characters	major			shakespeare's successor . christopher marlowe and william shakespeare were indeed grand masters of literature for all time . paradise lost and paradise regained is enough to put john milton in the same category . like marlowe and shakespeare , milton demonstrates extreme scholarship and a superb mastery of the language . it is interesting how milton takes figures that are mentioned briefly in the scriptures and turns them into major characters . it is also frightening how milton was able to make god and satan 3 dimensional as opposed to simply good in god's case and evil in satan's case . this book is not for everyone . but if you do not mind an unorthodox portrayal of god and satan and if you want to enjoy beautiful language , superb images , dramatic confrontations , and powerful images , you must read this masterpiece composed with superb and delicate skill .
2			sense	common	sense	basic	photos	good	it	easy	bullet	expensive	it	clear	b	amazing	it	hard			five star product ! i used a hoya uv filter on my canon sx 40 to protect the lens . i always found the hoya hard to clean and it always seemed to hold a film . i took a photo class at the nearby pisgah wildlife center . the instructor commented about filters and that any resulting photos will only be as good as the quality of whatever glass is in front of the camera , including filters . how basic and common sense this comment was ! i decided to bite the expensive bullet and get a top of the line filter . this b w filter is amazing . it is easy to clean and it is so crystal clear that it sometimes is hard to even see there is any glass in the filter housing . guess you do get what you pay for .
2			mason	wide	debut	strong			cozy canadian rock . i was first introduced to this band when they opened for wide mouth mason last year . i was immediately blown away , and picked up a cd after the album is a very strong debut , with lots of catchy songs , and some wonderful guitar work . be sure to check out falling into you and usual to me you will be hooked .
1			morning	next	they	nice			showgirls disc problems . i enjoyed the movie even though i was only able to watch it in segments . the first time i tried to watch it , after about 20 minutes , the screen went to digital gibberish and my dvd player hung up so that i couldn not even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power . i had to unplug the dvd player , wait , and replug the power cord to remove the disc . overnight , i decided i needed to replace my dvd player . however , the next morning , i tried a different dvd and it worked fine . it still works fine on all my other dvds . i complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of showgirls . unfortunately , this one has the same problem . it plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my dvd player . i gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without showgirls . i use my dvd player almost every day and it works fine except when i try to watch showgirls .

1			reviews	good			does not fit any of our outlets only has center screw . we ordered this because of all the good reviews only to realize that all of our electrical outlets have screws at the top and the bottom of the outlet plate and not at the center . this product only has a screw to fasten it to the outlet in the center with none for the top or the bottom which is exactly opposite of what we need . you should check your situation before you order this outlet plate ; it is unusable for us .

2			topics	general	appendix	large	appendix	useful	intro	good	book	good			good masonry engineering intro . . this book was my first experience with masonry design . this book covers a lot of general topics as well as some engineering discussion . while there is an adequate number of worked out design / analysis examples there was not as many as i had hoped to see . this is a good book for a beginning engineer in structures like me but has very little to offer an engineer with masonry large appendix is very useful as a refernce for many items that is , wind load .
2			i	glad	boy	surprised			totally not what i expected ! when this movie first came out , just the title was a turn off . it seemed too quirky and the title made me think dumb comedy . well recently , it was recommended by a radio personality so i decided to rent it . boy was surprised at how much i enjoyed this film ! first of all i love ryan gosling , he played the part perfectly ! this film has some funny parts , but mostly i was touched and actually teared up in many parts . i m glad i finally got to see it and would recommend this to anyone !

1			connection	stable	cost	low	joke	complete			waste of time and money . do not , under any circumstances , purchase this cardi bought this nic at compusa for $ 40 and thought it would make a nice , low cost wireless ca rd this thing was a nightmare from start to finish . the configuration utility that comes with it is totally counterintuitive . nothing is where you think it would be . after installation , it detected my wireless network just fine . steady 80 -90 signal strength with ninety five percent packet loss . the connection would be stable for two minutes at the most and then die . i tried different pci slots , i tried different channels , i tried uninstalling and reinstalling the software . nothing worked . i called d link support multiple times and spoke to a totally clueless technician each time . they offered such pearls as try a different router and try uninstalling your sound card . please . there are plenty of other complaints online about this piece of junk . don not bother buying this ca rd it's a complete joke .
1			carafe	big	alternatives	worth	product	suck			leaves a lot to be desired . i bought this because i felt wasteful using the cups in the machine at work , but also did not like the coffee used to fill the big carafe . this product sucks , though , and usually overflows and leaves my coffee mug a watery mess with grinds in it . i don not really recommend it , but i don not know of any alternatives that are worth purchasing .
1			couple	pleasant			like dr evil said , one calorie just ain not enough . this album has one of the most gorgeous pop songs of the 1990 s in i m so lonely , but sadly , the rest of the album fails to live up to its shimmering heights . a couple of the other songs are pleasant free me , guiding star , but save your money , especially at this price . definitely not worth it . go buy the la's album instead .
2			choice	great	choice	fantastic	i	happy	mix	small	mix	large			fantastic choice ! i am so happy that i took the time and read all the reviews ! this is an great choice for the money . i have a very large lab mix and a very small sheltie / cocker mix and it does a wonderful job on both . in the long run i will save a bundle on grooming expenses .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			as bad as you might expect . yesterday i gave one star to the art of being . and now i am not sure how to rate this crap . it is ages since i have seen something so meaningless , so boring , so bad . i think every 5 years old with a camera could make something more intelligent than that . there is no action , the dialogues are nothing . while watching , i couldn not escape the feeling of taking something heavy and throw at the tv . avoid if you can .
2			they	fun			a lovely read . charming and delicious ! the characters aren not exactly realistic but they are well done and fun to know . the plot isn not exactly realistic either , it's fiction after all ! i have never been to the south of france but this book made me fall in love with it . i was a bit confused by the side plot of the bank robbery , but even that was enjoyable and funny , even funnier when it all came together towards the end . definitely a book i would recommend !
1			songs	humorous	context	broad	news	bad	cds	instrumental	they	thick	cds	exciting	key	old	vibes	bad			a few excellent cuts but mostly boring . i collect instrumental surf cds and have a very broad context within which to place the songs on this disk . the two songs by the coffin daggers are expressive , energetic , ironically humorous , beautifully played , and lovely sounding . they are thick with gorgeous guitar distortion . the rest of the songs are not in the same league , and sound like simplistic garage rock . it makes more sense to get a coffin daggers cd . even the volcanos whose own two cds are sparkling and exciting sound boring here in a rip off of the old standard church key they call bad news . i have listened to this cd several dozen times and the bad vibes have grown strong . several collections that are much better and i still enjoy after many many hearings are bikini world , swivelin wahini surfs up and beyond the beach .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			same stories different cover . my husband and i enjoyed and learned from the first one we read . i thought this version would be geared toward men and he might like it . imagine our surprise when we opened the book and the stories were the same .
1			stars	stars no			mine broke too . i have been through 2 of these already . both got the same noop bug as all the other reviewers , and both within just a few months . wish i had read the reviews first and saved my $$$ . i would give it zero stars if i could .
1			look	good			look good , but not buff . so i bought these shorts and i thought they would make me look buff like the guy in the photo . turns out that you need to have image issues , take steroids , and have the personality of a hardboiled egg to be as buff as that guy . oh well .
2			it	funny	chickens	little	him	hate			do the chicken dance . not every one will get this book . it is sort of like puns and how some people like seinfeld , and some hate him , etc but this book is totally imaginative and artistic . personally , i laughed ha rd put it down . picked it up and laughed again . it is particularly funny if you used to play with those little fuzzy chickens made of fuzz and glue from the easter your sense of humor is somewhat whacky , the book is more than well worth it . besides , it will make you smile .
1			gun	defective	unit	defective			received defective unit . i received a defective unit . the motor was working fine but the water leaked out from the pistol and it had no pressure . inquired online with the tech support and they confirmed the gun was defective . i returned it to amazon . nevertheless , i was impressed with amazon's return policy and procedures . all i need to do was to print the return shipping label and attach it to the box and then bring it to any ups store for shipping . i did not have to pay for the shipping for the unit when i ordered neither for the retuning shipping co st amazon made the whole return process painless .
1			book	boring	youll	stupid	books	worst			this book it one of the worst books you will ever read . this book is sooooo boring . it is no thumbs up . we were forced to read it by my teacher . i was goin to give it no stars but my teacher said number someone dies then nothing happens . it keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going on and on and on ! the plot stinks . if you like doing nothing for 2 hours or how ever long this would take you then youd like this book . this book had 4 stars but it deserved none . if your dull and stupid youll like the book .
2			album	greatest			essential . timeless . along with klf , woob and reload ambient greatest album ever made in ambient . joey's effort is absolutely timeless it's sounds in 2007 like it was made yesterday . buy it . love it .
2			power	magical	teacher	reliable	thing	bad	brain	little	part	best			terrific ! i wish i was matilda . matilda has magical power that can make things is a very brainy kid but the bad thing was that she came from a disfunctional i were her , i could play tricks on people and make them think that there is a also i can relax my mind when it comes to any subject . i can read books every minute . i will love to have her brainy little brain . i know she will be successful one day . i admire her for her brain . i said to myself , wow , what a girl . it's a pity her parents think that she is a scab when she is a genious . luckily , she has a pretty and reliable teacher to confide her fear , happiness and best part of the story was when the headmistress , miss trunchbull had a newt on her had to shake it off . everyone in the class roared with way she danced was so teribbly funny . i like matilda because she is a wonderful girl .
1			threat	greatest	effort	effective	interests	political	smokescreen	scientific			a smokescreen . this book is based on a tenditious and self serving interpretation of the existing data . worst yet , the author provides a scientific smokescreen for those economic and political interests which are blocking any effective effort to address the single greatest threat to humanity and this planet , climate change . for an accurate understanding of the political and economic forces arrayed against appropriate environmental policies i recommend matthew cahn's environmental deceptions and george gonzalez's corporate power and the environment .
2			players	best	team	best	coach	former	wings	new			good read . this book is about woodsie and the new wolfbay wings . the year before this they were the best team in half the country . no one is more suprised when woodsie makes the team this year . the former coach has left and taken the five best players with him . woodsie knows that he is going to get bugged at summer camp but can everyone just get along and win hockey . you have to see .
2			footage	great			really amazing ! if you enjoy jazz , especially wes montgomery , do yourself a favor and pick this up . watching wes play guitar makes me want to hang mine up , or practice my rear off . this is just great footage of a legend .
1			i	disappointed			did not load very disappointed . i tried several times to get this game to load on my xp system with no success . i am a geography teacher and thought i could use this game in my class , but i was sorely disappointed . it was a cheap price and i see why now .
1			quality	low			low quality . i haven not had one break but that is only because they don not really work most of the time . the wire insulation often slips in the jaws preventing the wire from being stripped . both have been sent to the circular file !
1			library	local	offender	worst	reason	curious			glacial tempi . i picked this disc up at our local library's book sale . some excellent performers , plus a mixture of conductors , but for some curious reason all of the conductors favoured an extremely slow tempo . the worst offender was track three the fliedermonolog , sung by the superb hermann prey , but utterly destroyed by kurt woss , whose tempo suggested that prey popped out for a smoke between bars . i found myself shouting get on with it ! this one goes back into the donations bin for next year .
2			reenactment	great	effects	special	actresses	great	plot	great	actors	great			great reenactment of history ! i really enjoyed pearl harbor because of the special effects , but without the great plot , they wouldn not have mattered . i thought the actors and actresses chosen for the film were great . they delivered excellent performances and i actually understood what , with some exceptions , really happened on that fateful december day .
2			work	readable	reference	great	work	clear	book	small			a great reference for study or research . this work is a clear , concise and readable work on french organization , strategy , and tactics from the french revolution to waterloo . the book also covers the enemies of france during that time period . for such a small book , less than 300 pages , rothenberg provides a wealth of information . i found myself repeatedly underlining passages in this book . a great reference to be used in any study of the epoch . well worth the modest cost , highly recommended .
2			design	modern	control	worst	things	short	control	poor	applications	bad	design	hate			maybe the nicest ml figure ever . i will keep things short . i own almost every ml figure and i really wasn not expecting much from this ironman as in the comic i hate his modern armor design . this figure was not a priority for me to , was i wrong ! this might be the nicest ml ever ! beautifully sculpted with a ton of articulation and an awesome base featuring destroyed ultron robots . ironman really you collect mls get him ! btw , be forewarned , from my experiences i can tell you that amazon seems to get the mls with the worst quality control it seems that ml quality control can be poor in general . i mean bad paint applications , missing parts , two right hands , etc if you can find these figures elsewhere and check them out before you purchase them , i would recommend that .
2			recipes	delicious	baby	new	ideas	healthy	cookbook	great			great for nursing moms . great cookbook ! delicious recipes . healthy ideas for nursing moms , especially how to increase lactation . the only drawback was that some of the recipes required so many ingredients . hard to accomplish with a new baby at home . but when i did , the whole family enjoyed the dish . highly recommend this cookbook .
1			poses	available			. superior or just . the figures arms cannot be lowered , limiting the available poses to waving gestures .
1			reviews	bad			trust the bad reviews . i can not believe this was considered a feature film and not a b movie . if all you care about is explosions , you will love this movie . and , if all you care about is cameron diaz , you might also love this , if you care anything about storyline , plot , character development or just good acting , you will be rogen should just be ousted from hollywood after such a catastrophic , epic motion picture failure .
1			diets	free	information	useful	steps	practical	recipes	useless			not much use , really . a lot of christian tosh interspersed with some useful information about practical steps to take to get candida under control . the recipes are useless for people following food combining or gluten free diets . overall , i wish i never bought it .
1			it	nice	moment	best	game	basic	game	similar			on the spot your shoe y . s . p . i have never read a better review for a game than the one that your shoe y . s . p made for this game . i have only heard of inuyasha by reputation but i have never really had the chance to see it . i bought the game thinking that it could get me started and give me a that head start for the series . the begining of the game looks like a mini clip from an anime which it was nice , probably the best moment of the game until you get sent back in time . anywayz , i m not an rpg fan but i love ff and kingdom hearts . this game , on the other hand , was really a waste of time . what really did it for me was the very frequent battles . something that could take you maybe 30 min . it now takes 3 freakin hours because every 5 sec . ur doing another random yet similar a very basic rpg game , with not a lot of thought put into it nor a compelling story and extremely annoying .
2			i	good no	it	enjoyable			saved me hundreds of dollars . i like being able to read these books since i don not own an xbox and am not good at playing video games . it's enjoyable to have the story unfold without restarting .
1			text	ridiculous	i	disappointed	french	original	overflow	short	format	terrible	it	worth			the text format of this book is terrible ! dumas rates five stars ; the story rates five stars , but the formatting makes reading it on the kindle a nightmare ! the lines of text are fixed length , and they are longer than the width of the kindle page , even at the smallest character set size . thus each line displays as one full line , followed by a short overflow or word wrap line . ugh ! i asked for , and received , my money back , and i deleted the item from my kindle . i am very disappointed , as i wanted to read it in the original french , but i couldn not cope with the jerkiness that the ridiculous text formatting imposes on the reading process . ok , i see others didn not seem to notice . . so , i guess i m picky . but there you are my opinion , for what it's worth .
1			it	flat	it	dead			book of mormon the koran . i compare this book to the koran . i tried to read the bom through but i found it so uninspiring and flat that i could not endure to continue . i experienced the same thing with the koran . i tried to read islams holy book and i found it as dead and sterile as the bofm . i have heard so much about both of these books that i thought i would at least try and read them to find out what all the excitement was about . if you can sit down and read the book of mormon from start to you have a more diciplined mind than me .
2			quality	good			bike basket . good quality overall . the braket for the stem didn not fit my application , so i improvised , and mounted it behind the seat over the rear fender and low . holds stuff .
2			seat	nice	job	nice	sides	easy			nice seamless booster seat ! i bought this booster seat because there was so seams or cracks for food to get into , and it appeared easy to clean . i also liked that there was no seat belt as my son doesn not need the seat belt and it's just one more thing to get in the way and to clean . all in all this booster does a nice job . the sides are easy to clean and it's comfy for him . my gripes are that i wish it had straps to hold it on to the chair , as it tips easily if he tips , and it usually ends up on the floor when he gets down . also , it has a rougher surface not uncomfortable though where he sits , i m guessing to help keep his butt from sliding . that rougher part is harder to wipe clean . the only way i can get it clean it to submurse it in water . otherwise the sides of the seat wipe down easily . all in all it's what i was looking for and it meets my expectations .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			odor eliminator . i was introduced to this product in the hospital when i had back surgery . i used it a home and found it to be the most awesome clean smelling product i had ever found . and , it eleminated odors with one spray not a cover up . i have supplied friends and family with this product . i can not say enought about it .
2			rubber	comfortable no	wish	bad	grip	comfortable no	stuff	new	dollars	great			not to bad wish it was cheaper for what it is . i replaced a gaming mx 518 for this g 7 the g 7 is a bit heaver and has a hair less fit on the backside of my palm . repose time for a wireless is amazing . install was less then 3 min . side rubber or grip on the mouse is not as comfortable as the mx 518 but i think this new stuff is to prevent ware and tear like my 518 did . all in all i like the mouse its great just not worth 68 dollars to me . i if i had the chance again i would spend 44 dollars on the mx 518 again it was a tank of a mouse with a bit nicer fit on the hands .
1			dvd	wrong	i	tired	stores	local			wrong dvd sent and they say that the wanted dvd is sold out . i ordered a multi region dvd so i can view all my films from denmark . they have offered that i could return it but i just want the right dvd . i also discarded the package it was sent in . the philips cvp 5140 is supposed to be multi region but they say that the model i received was missing 3 digits after the model name . and that the model i wanted had different digits after the model number . i am just so tired of this that i am probably never going to order any electronics from amazon out of fear that there is some invisible digits following the model number and therefor will not work . i have been a loyal customer for many years but feel that since amazon involve vendors that are not living up to what they promise , i have to go back to local stores where i test the merchandise and check the dvds upon purchase . sincerelysteen lauridsen
1			killer	serial	killer	mysterious			a movie that's going nowhere . jude law plays this mysterious vampire / serial killer who meets his match in i . falls in love with elina lowensohn . an overlong film . lot's of navel gazing and moments of expresionless facial shots . in short , a film trying to suck in the art house crowd . i have reason to believe that the title has been changed to give the prospective victim the buyer a clue to the flimsy plot ! we have seen edgy vampires done before and this ain not it !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not pleased . i guess i didn not read the info very well because i was shocked when this came at how small it really was . i have a 22 b jack russell and this is too small for her .
2			practices	medical	you	interested	tales	classic	read	difficult	sea	wide	organization	social	job	great			the perfect gift for a mother , daughter , sister , or aunt . anita diamant does a great job of retelling the story of dinah from the book of genesis . the story is told in dinah's voice and from the point of view of the women around her . this is a story about mothers , daughters , husbands , and sons . i specifically liked the details about the food and farming , social organization , and medical practices of the time . i was able to easily imagine the caravans , midwives , artisans , and would be a difficult read for those who take the bible literally but for me , it makes me wonder what the bible would read like if it were written by is a clever idea i like it when a author retells a story from a different perspective . i recommend sena jeter naslund's , ahab's wife and jeanne rhy's , wide sargasso sea if you are interested in a different perspective from either of the classic tales moby dick or jane eyre .
1			i	wrong	mexico	new	i	impressed			completely disappointing . when you read the back of the dvd to find out the plot , please remember that what is written is misleading . i watched the movie expecting some sort of demon as the evil in the movie . however , i was wrong . very wrong . the evil they find in this movie is not what you would think of when you think supernatural . also , this is not tommy lee jones best acting . although , i was fairly impressed with cate blanchett as a pioneer woman in new mexico . have been warned .

1			it	awful	barkers	heavy			works but . my father bought this product for their 11 year old adopted beagle / hound mix . the collar definitely shocks when she barks , so it does work however , it only senses the vibrations on the throat , not an actual bark . so after the dog barked , it shocked her so she whimpered and it shocked her again stronger so she cried again and it was just an awful , horrible circle until i was able to take it off her . it also will shock if the dog just sneezes . i understand that sometimes with heavy barkers , they need to be helped and trained not to bark as often as they do , but this is certainly not a helper . the collar is now in the garbage and i will be buying them the spraying one instead . and just a side thought , if it was as harmless of a shock as it says , most things don not cry or whimper unless their being hurt .
1			quality	terrible	i	upset no			horrifying . the image and sound quality of this dvd is horrifyingly and insultingly terrible . by far the worst of any dvd i have ever purchased . the image quality it poor and frequently blurry , the audio soundtrack is frequently out of sync with the picture , and it is obvious that the screen dimensions have been altered . i feel duped and honestly could not be more upset with this edition . while certainly not a classic like gone with the wind , raintree county is an interesting and historically significant film and it deserves a better dvd edition than this garbage ! save your money and stay far away from this disc .
1			bugs	interested no			absolute waste of money . literally does nothing but take up space . bugs walk around and are not even remotely interested in stopping in . i m not sure if the lure even works . i also don not see how they would actually stick to the box . doesn not seem sticky enough .
2			boxer	special			bark if you love me . loved it ! then i had to read the 2 d book written about libro . boxers are wonderful dogs and i loved reading about this special boxer .
2			songs	great	others	good			awesome . usually , you buy a cd only because of one or two songs on it that you like . this cd has four great songs on it and all the others are pretty good too .
1			drivel	worst	book	bad			chic lit . this book was recommended to me because it take place in the city where my ancestors came from . as a male i have never read a harlequin romance , but this book must be bad even by that standa rd the first couple of chapters were the worst romantic drivel i have ever read . perhaps it gets better farther into the story , but i wasn not going to waste my time trying to find out if it did .
1			investment	true	clause	due	practitioner	careful	technique	valuable no	premise	central	services	real	book	exciting	method	traditional	estate	real			careful ! this book is very exciting , taking a tried and true real estate investment technique 'subject to purchase and adding a twist that supposedly makes the exit strategy what would otherwise be known as a 'sandwich lease option safer than the traditional method for everyone concerned . further investigation , though , indicates the practitioner should be very careful in following these recommendations . for one thing , the argument is used that the land trust technique touted by the author's real estate services company prevents the mortgage holder from exercising a due on sale clause . cleverly backed up by a partial citation of a federal regulation , but not technique may indeed be valuable , may indeed make everyone feel safer , but the central premise is faulty . i recommend mark kohler's lawyers are liars as a balance to this book .
1			story	good	team	good	read	easy	premise	entire			kind of a waste of time but . first of all i can not believe the reviews this book has was an easy read but certainly not what i was expecting in light of the previously mentioned reviews . i geuss it goes to show what a good marketing team can accomplish . i wouldn not recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a good or interesting story . other than eddie's heroic death , i found the entire premise rather two stars from me
2			you	free	part	worst			katy 13 says , this book was ggrrreeeaattt ! ! i loved this book what with all of the adventure and still giving you information on what you can eat in the wilderness . i wouls love to be sam . there should be a lot more than three books in the series . if you would like a place where you can just be you and be free stick your nose into this book and it just might never come out . the one and only thing i would have changed is the book should have been longer . the worst part of the book is when it ends . katy 13
2			brennan	good	dialogue	great	hands	capable	impression	strong			what dialogue ! for whatever reason , i was taken aback by how much i enjoyed to have and have not the first time i saw it , and every subsequent viewing has left just as strong an impression . it's the dialogue that gets me each time . it's witty , smart , wry , and in the capable hands of humphrey bogart and lauren bacall , it's a treat to hear . bogart gives a relaxed , assured performance that ranks with his best , and bacall is a lot of fun in her first film , mixing sexiness and humour with a quiet vulnerability . walter brennan , very good as bogart's drunk sidekick , adds to the story . there's not a whole lot to the plot , but there is a lot of chemistry , and when mixed with the great dialogue , the viewer gets to sit back and just enjoy the show that bogart and bacall put on .
2			installation	easy	room	large	room	entire			warm toes in minnesota . it gets cold in minnesota ! we have a large family room in our older house with a horribly cold floor it's built over a crawl space . i wouldn not think of sitting in this room without wool socks and slippers . not any more ! the rug buddy as transformed the floor into a cozy oasis where you want to keep your feet . i also believe it has warmed the entire room has a hardwood floor and an area rug . we installed the rug buddy between the rug pad and the rug . the installation was easy and except for the cord you don not see it or feel it when you walk on the rug you feel the warmth but not the thickness of the rug buddy . my only complaint is the cord which i felt was too short .
2			i	thrilled	use	good	version	large			perfect size for our trailer . i already own the larger version of this oxo salad spinner , and it gets lots of use at home . i am skeptical of the supposed pre washed bags of salad , and washing our salad using the salad spinner is so easy . i was hesitant to buy one for our airstream trailer , since the large version takes up so much at home , in my kitchen cabinet . i was thrilled to find this smaller , compact spinner ! i am currently traveling , and the mini salad spinner by oxo has been put to good use on the road already .
1			cds	worst	day	worst	cd	entire	music	good			sad , whiny , immature . this is by far one of the worst cds i have ever hea rd not because of the music , but because of the lyrics . you can tell off the bat by the song titles how immature this band is , along with their music and entire cd is nothing but a pity fest , whining about how they dont wanna grow up , or that they are living the worst day ever . if you want immature snobby music , then this is the stuff for you , but if you want real , good quality music that takes talent to write and play , look somewhere else .
1			font	large	way	bad	concerns	real	short	good			interesting but meaningless . this book is not unlike don regan's for the record about his years with ronald reagan . like regan , morris had worked closely with the first family , and like regan , it ended badly for him . so , what did he go ? he went and wrote a mean spirited book about the people who made his name famous . morris book is so vindictive and meanspirited that it obscures some real concerns about the person of hillary clinton . he sees everything about her in a bad way , and i can only conclude that the clinton's snubbing of morris is the cause of , morris was an advisor to the clintons at various times of their career , but so were a lot of people . it doesn not make him an expert on hillary clinton and his analysis is most definately not the final wo rd dissapointingly short , this book is printed in large font with double spacing . a good short in flight read that should be taken as seriously as a tabloid rag .
2			player	great	player	good	content	political	cd	great	drummer	exceptional	they	amazing	song	bad	rock	hard	songs	good			great cd . this cd is great . the band is made up of daron who is a great guitar player , shavo a good bass player , serj a amazing singer / song writer , and john who is an exceptional drummer . this cd has most of system of a down's good songs like pshyco , chop suey , toxcicity , and the prison song . i actually cant think of a bad song on the whole cd . soad is very unigue . there isnt a band out there that can match soads unigue style and sound . there is absolutely nothing like system of a down . once you hear some soad music you will be singing it for days or even weeks . system of a down even touches on political content . their music is meaningfull . they arent just one of those bands that go out there and just scream about nothing . they are amazing . this is a must buy for anybody that likes hard rock or metal !
2			movie	great	care	great	accounts	various	history	interested	everything	necessary	screen	big			needs to be made into a movie . definitely worth reading . it's a fascinating story . the back cover blurb and stephen ambrose's foreward both compare it to slavomir rawicz's the long walk , but it's actually better than rawicz's tale , mostly because it's so well documented . david howarth takes great care in synchronizing the various accounts and piecing together the story ; the included photos of the locations and people mentioned in the narrative also helped to cement its believability . i would highly recommend it to anyone interested in wwii history or adventure stories in general . i would also love to see it translated to film for the big screen it has everything necessary to make a great movie , including a love story !

2			basis	regular	ms	proble	system	traditional	dust	heavy	it	worth	fence	electric			looking for more . i got this air purifier on the advice of a friend . his mother had one , and raved about it . well , compared to nothing , there is definitely an appriciable difference . i can not argue there . it does wonders for removing the smallest of particles from the air . so , very good for said , there are some proble ms any lint in the air tends to start it zapping . it will sound like an electric fence cooking a weed . for days if you don not get around to cleaning it more thoroughly than the guide suggests you would ever need to . it doesn not remove heavy dust or lint from the air effectively either . so you won not even notice the difference when it's time to clean your house or you are suffering from indoor allergies , don not mind cleaning every two weeks not every 3 months , and can stand the zapping noise on a regular basis , it's worth it . otherwise , you might shoot for a more traditional forced air filter system .

1			mistake	huge	review	negative			junk , the whole movie should have ended up on the cutting room floor . i didn not read the book ; i purchased it based on the actors , that was a huge mistake . had i paid attention to the people who rated this with one star i could have spared myself the anguish of watching it . i have 24 movies with bruce willis in them and its goes without saying i now have 23 this went in the trash . i wouldn not think of even giving it away for fear someone found out i actually paid money for this garbage . i have a collection pushing 1800 dvds and this is the first time i have had to write a negative review .
1			reception	good	feels	cheap	towers	main	thing	good			worse than my bunny ears . i live in san mateo , which is over 20 from the main san francisco towers . i know i won not get good reception , but i didn not think my $ 10 bunny ears with a base and a circular loop piece in the middle from target was better than this one . the zenith feels very cheap , but it's obviously working for many people . i would have rated it higher , but i can not because obviously , it can not be just my location if my bunny ears perform better . i m mainly using it for analog reception . i bet this thing is very good if i were closer to the transmission tower , compared to using another type of antenna . but for long distances , this thing seems to be worse .

2			looks	awesome	looks	great	tool	great	edges	sharp			garden knife works well , looks awesome . i bought this because peak oil and climate change are slowly undermining world food security yeah , never mind so i needed some beginner gardening tools like shovel and pitchfork and stuff . a friend sent me a link to this garden knife , so i said what the hey . it looks great and works well , it can dig , break up soil , cut buried roots in place with a serrated or straight edge , and it even has a scale if you want to be super precise about how deep you are advice ? if you think you might like it , buy it . great hand tool . oh , and also , it's not just a hand digger it's a hand digger with really sharp edges on both sides . so don not carelessly wipe off the dirt with your hand , or you could cut yourself . be smarter than me , ok ?
1			type	japanese	orkid	black	section	fresh	i	happy	flick	old	movie	good			beatiful breast fresh out of the implant section . i thought i would check out othr type movies , and i love japanese type . this movie was made in 1995 the setting mobster type with an assasin black orkid . this is something you would expect from an old american detective type flick . but it has a good movie is easy to follow lots of action not much sex only the beganing scene . but it does flow well . funny dialogs too . i was happy i purchased it , liked the movie and how it was done . you won not go wrong with it .
1			typos	acceptable no	topics	necessary	editing	poor			extremely poor editing . this book seems to cover all the necessary topics for the 70 -536 exam , but the errors / typos are totally unacceptable . this is probably the most poorly edited book i have ever read . repeated paragraphs , copy and paste errors , code that doesn not lose confidence in the book and when something doesn not make sense , i find myself wondering if i don not understand the concept or if it's just another error . again , if you can get past the errors , the book does cover all of the necessary topics .
2			account	real	drama	real			eerie real life drama . this is an eeerie real life account of what happened back in 1963 the details of the investigation both shock and frustrated me as i could not believe our justice system essentially allowed these two criminals so muck leeway . the surviving cop's life became a testament to why stricted laws needed to be put in place and why therapy is something that allows a cleansing of the soul for those who need it .

1			quality	poor	purpose	entire			poor quality stainless steel . product began to rust 60 days after purchase , the entire purpose of purchasing this product is to prevent rust , speaking to reese they said that this product had been obsolete for 5 years , i recd a replacement from amazon , looks like the same , time will tell .
1			information	basic	information	new	look	simple	information	useful	ideas	healthy			disappointing . this book is truly designed for those who have never read anything about feeding their baby or toddler . i did not really find any of the information new or very useful . some of the recipes look simple enough to try , but i was disappointed that they do not include basic nutritional information . i would also have preferred to see mention of portion sizes , as well as healthy non perishable snack ideas for toting in the diaper bag my toddler is not yet ready for raw veggies . but if you are looking for just the very basics and don not really need details or a lot of information , this might be for you . i personally find the information i get in some of my magazine subscriptions more useful .
2			book	next	team	large	team	small	it	fresh	manager	active	team	great			a must have resource for the pro active manager . dr harris has hit the mark ! this resource is conversationally written to the middle manager . it is obvious that he has researched and experienced the opportunities of every day management of only does he tell how others have succeeded in the challenges associated with employee motivation and retention , he gives practical , do able , action steps for building a great team , small or large . i discovered the book by word of mouth and have subsequently given it as a gift to others . not long ago i saw getting employees to fall in love with your company between bookends atop the credenza in a friend's office , who also sang its praises . i look forward to dr harris's next book . undoubtedly it will also be fresh , on the cutting edge , and on my shelf .

1			pilots	great	lip	bad	movie	worst			the worst movie i have ever seen about these 2 great pilots . too phoney , lots of errors in the way the movie was made , also bad lip syncing from the woman singer , they played them off as ruthless killers when in fact all other stories tell otherwise . one part shows the bullet shot to the top of his head while flying , but yet when you see him with his head bandaged up its wraped around the side of his head for a wound to the top .

1			features	new	disclaimer	small	information	useful	features	old			not bad , but not 1.1 . the book is well organized and has lots of useful information in it . what really bothers me about it is that even though it advertises itself as being 1.1 many of the examples are in fact in 1.0 they have a small disclaimer that says that new features have examples in 1.1 and while old features are in 1.0 can you say lazy ?
2			part	best			one of the cleverist movies ever writen . the first time i say scream , i was glued to the theater screen wondering what was going to happen next . the best part of the movie was the sleek plot , and the hip dioluge . it was one of the years best , and a must see .

1			letdown	huge	he	pretty	series	good	movie	worth	movie	big	patrick	old			kind of a let down to a good series . here it comes ! the big movie of the hilarious tv series , it's the spongbob squarepants movie ! spongbob and patrick are on a mission to save king neptunne's crown , and they travel a long long way . despite my two stars , the move has it's moments when you laugh and giggle . but the movie lost the essance of the series it wasn not that funny . spongebob was the icon of goody goodness fun . but then the movie is a huge letdown and there should be a sequel to imrpove the funny moments are when patrick falls in love with the mermaid , i think her name was cyndi ? and he's like your pretty ! same old patrick , the character that stays consistent . movie is worth a rent . some crude humor and weird images .
2			fit	good	cover	good			good cover . other reviewers complain about how hard it is to put this cover on and off . i agree , but i don not think it's the cover manufacturer's fault . the heater shape is what makes it ha rd once the cover is on , it's a good fit .

1			i	heavy no			couldn not use it . after adjusting the leg pieces for several days wearing socks & boots and then even replacing these with foam rolls i still cannot prevent the ankle strain when using this product , even at a 45 egree incline . i know somebody else who has one and they like it so i guess it depends on the person , i am not heavy for my size and never thought this would be an issue .
1			ride	emotional			secrets revealed by the notebook effect elderly woman's life . another disappointing attempt at creating a moving romance . the author equates love with tragedy . true , all life ends in death , but he dwells on the negative rather than the positive . the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride and then drops them off the cliff into oblivion . don not bother with this book or you will need prosac to face the day .

1			play	great	work	old	cut	final	parts	good			a turning point indeed . well , it's like this . i m mainly an admirer of pink floyd's old school work if anything . their first hit single and known released song far as i know arnold layne still is my favorite if i had to pick just one . that having been said , see emily play was great too . my absolute favorite is debatable between dark side of the moon the 2 d best selling album ever behind michael jackson's thriller the very touchy thought provoking wish you were here , particularly it's centerpiece track especially parts 5 6 7 8 9 animals was good , 1 or 2 songs better than others but as was definitely the case with 1983 s final cut this just sounds more like a roger waters solo album versus pink floyd as they are defined by .

2			society	traditional	love	true	geisha	traditional	mr	golden	page	final	arthur	golden			a forbidden world unmasked . arthur golden lifts the veil of secrecy into the secret world of the geisha . sayuri strikes a balance between being a traditional geisha and being a woman in control of her destiny . whether it is outwitting her rivals , or finding her true love as her traditional society crumbles around her she triumphs . the sensuality and detail with which mr golden writes , takes the reader into a world of which most westerners have no comprehension . i felt as though i lost a friend as i read the final page . i have recommended this book to everyone !

1			book	similar	seemed	smart	commitment	normal	book	horrible			horrible . i loved the sevenwaters trilogy so much but this book is just horrible . i tried so hard to like it that i actually read to page 225 which is way beyond my normal commitment to a dumb book . the 3 primary characters are either disgustingly evil , a gorgeous dumb murderer / warrior , or a too late in arriving heroine too late to save my intere st i stopped just about where she was going to save him this theme felt to similar to liadan saving the painted man in the son of the shadows book . at least the murdering painted man seemed smart before he was reformed .

1			thumbs	big	me	curious			slow paced . so in the past i have read many books like this but i just don not have the willpower to finish reading this one . it is still unfinished right now and i have absolutely desire to finish it . i believe the story is really slow paced , i don not see the connection between the two , and the story didn not provoke anything at all in me that made me curious as to how it ended . over all i give this book a big thumbs down .
1			product	poor	product	new	i	surprised	scanner	original	service	poor			poor product ; poor customer service . bought the original scanner as a gift for my son . no one in our family was ever able to get it to scan even a test bar code from the manual . and radica's customer service was basically non existant . i really expected them to go out of business since they wouldn not respond to phone calls or emails for support , so i m surprised to see they have a new product out . i don not recommend buyng products from this company .

2			papers	scientific	interlude	lyrical	disagreements	professional	chapters	final	novel	huge			mental health . this huge novel spans the careers of two pioneering psychiatrists , one french , one english , who meet as boys and eventually co found a sanatorium in the mountains of austria , until driven apart by professional disagreements and the outbreak of the first war . for the first 250 pages of this 600 page book , the story holds the interest with warm characters , fascinating settings , and the stirrings of romance . however , the long lectures and scientific papers that faulks uses to demonstrate the growing differences between the two one is a freudian , the other a darwinian come to clog the book around the half way point , and although the two men continue to develop in interesting ways as people , he loses the sense of linear narrative . but faulks pulls it all together in the last hundred pages ; always a magnificent war novelist seebirdsong , his masterpiece , his ww 1 scenes appear almost as a lyrical interlude , with striking cathartic effect , and his final chapters have their own quiet beauty .
1			omissions	huge	notation	usual no			what role does this book serve ? overall , this is a well written book . it covers a variety of topics , from preference maximization through existence and stability of eq ia , to optimal control and growth models . however , i m not sure what its niche is what this book provides that others don not , or that it covers more thoroughly . if you want math , read simon and blume or a math book . if you want micro theory , read mas collel or silberberg . if you want neoclassical macro theory , read sargent . for optimal control , read kamien / schwarz or seierstad / sydsaeter . this book covers selected topics from each . though it covers them well , much is left out . noticeably absent from the book is any uncertainty , randomness , or probability . there is also no game theory . these seek huge omissions for a book which seeks to show the usefulness of mathematical techniques in economic analysis . notation is also a bit unusual . i was a bit confused by some of the author's own notation for partial orderings and cartesian products .
1			creator	easy	users	regular	reviews	professional			easy media creator causes shutdown problem . i take exception to the reviewer that says skip the reviews by regular users and just use professional reviews . i am a pc tech , had problems with earlier versions so i thought version 8 would solve them . it did solve one , but my computer became unstable and began taking 5 minutes to shutdown . i finally discovered was the culprit in services . i stopped it from running and at least my pc acts normally again in shutting down .
2			info	good	book	helpful	deal	great	stuff	good			good info ! i thought this book is very helpful . it covers a great deal of only thing i suggest is make sure you research other study guides before choosing just one . i brought this one and found out that there was a better study guide out book covers a lot of good stuff that will be on the lpc exam but . the 5 h edition of the study guide for the national counselor examination is what ever one that i know used to prepare themselves for the exam . they never heard of encyclopedia of counseling . i did order the study to get it soon . i will post again once i take my test and let amazon know if i passed
1			misrepresentation	horrible	event	historical	license	creative			should be listed as fiction . what a horrible misrepresentation of this historical , well documented event . this goes beyond creative license . a very , very disappointing effort .
2			reading	easy	reading	solid	pleasure	predictable	deal	great			mac on the mac . this product is as comprehensive as i had hoped and then some . it makes for easy and solid reading from my kindle . i can also navigate quickly to find passages that i need . there is still so much to learn and a great deal of material to go through . but this bible is organized in such a way that the navigation is a predictable pleasure .
2			battery	extra	money	best	fan	huge	toy	best			the best toy ever . oh my gosh ! ! this is the best money we have ever spent on a toy . we gave this to our 3 year old for his birthday and he has not stopped driving . he loves the different speeds and the trailer to haul stuff . the look on his face when he is driving around the yard is priceless . i recommend this toy to anyone thinking of buying a battery powered vehicle for their child . the quality is unbeatable . it is larger than most battery operated vehicles , therefore giving more room for passengers . it also seems a little safer to me because of the size . my only other recommendation for anyone thinking of buying this toy is to buy an extra battery ! ! i am going today to buy another so that we do not have to wait for it to charge if we forget to take it out the evening before . again , this is the best toy we have ever purchased for our son . i am becoming a huge fan of peg perego we have two other peg perego vehicles .
1			job	right	price	right			works but noisy . this device works but it is very noisy . the part that secures the watch to the system is not well designed . if all you need is a device for keeping your watch wound then this machine does the job and the price is right .
1			number	comfortable no	number	little	heel	low			cute but uncomfortable . despite the relatively low heel , this cute little number is uncomfortable for walking more than a few feet . fine for sitting down and looking nice .
1			cd	bad	bat	original	bad	bad	album	great	it	bad			bad , bad , bad , very bad cd , as in not good . it was bad enough that we had to suffer through a bat out of hell 2 but this is really bad ! ! dont waste your money , buy the original bat out of hell 1 and thats it ! and if it wasnt for jim steinman there would be no bat out of hell ! meatloaf is a one hit or i should say album wonder , giving whats due the first one is a great album . this artist is trying to take peoples hard working money but have lost their creativity years ago and is probable out of money ! people when you see a part 2 or sadly a part 3 run and hold on to your wallets ! !
2			range	impressive	range	broad	repair	easy			the homeowner's guide to owning a house . i haven not actually tried to fix anything out of this yet , but the broad range of products and the detail therein is very impressive . from windows and doors , to counter tops and tile , to easy appliance repair , to problems with your pool , you aren not a contractor and own a house , buy this book .
2			books	good	situations	difficult	framework	useful	model	easy			simple , but useful . this book doesn not have a lot of concepts , but the framework that it presents for difficult communication situations is very useful . the author also uses a lot of examples to illustrate how the model is used . personally , i found there were too many examples in the book for my taste and i got tired of reading them . however , i know some people really relate to this approach and it does drive the model into terms of material , i think there are lots of other good books on the subject out there that pack more material into the same space . however , for people who want an easy model , quick and enjoyable read and some concepts they can apply right away , then this might be just right .
2			thing	bad	one	good	it	easy			really fun . i liked this game from the start . it took me about 5 minutes to download . when i started to play it i loved the fact that you could teach the water animals tricks . the bad thing is you cant teach all the animals tricks . this was the first expansion pack i got and i think it is a good one to start with because it is really easy .

1			amount	unbelievable			do not buy this item . this is the first time that i have ever ordered anything and felt the need to review it . let me start by saying that i have only been using this coffee pot for about two months and today the poorly attached handle came off in my hands . there are many other complaints . it is a lot smaller than they advertise . unscrewing the bottom takes an unbelievable amount of effort . be careful while cleaning the pot . it is possible to cut yourself on the poorly finished metal . i really thought i was purchasing one of the higher end stainless steel products , foolish me .
2			it	industrial no	set	international	content	sexual	album	best			groovy's voice ! the sleazy , cheesy sexual content ! super . i have owned this album for about 3 years and it just recently got stolen from me . i was heart broken . never has an album come out and equalled it in dancability . propably tkks 4 h best album , but i don not have reincarnation of luna . the main stand out on this album is groovy's and the bomb gang girlz flawless vocals . it is not industrial , but hey it is the funnest album i have ever owned ! standout tracks are mystery babylon , international sin set , continental touch , leathersex , and sexplosion !
2			it	simple	practice	extra	reviewers	previous	language	foreign			comprehensive . this is the most comprehensive foreign language book i have seen . it's simple , a 6 h grader could teach themselves spanish with this book . open it , read it , and memorize it . i had a terrible time with french and was not looking foward to learning spanish , but i picked it up immediately as i went along with this book . when the semester was over , i spent the summer reading the rest of it at my leisure . as far as the other reviews go , i m not sure what the problem was . it couldn not be explained any more clearly , perhaps they are moving too fast ? take a day for each page or something , whatever works . if you are not picking it up , it may be your study techniques and not the book . if you want extra practice , get the workbook . both the workbook and the textbook have the answers to every practice exercise of which there are an adequate amount in the back of the book . maybe the previous reviewers were unaware ?
2			diver	professional	book	great			first class thriller fiction ! great book from an interesting author ! he's used to be a professional offshore diver , so he knows what he's writing about . . which is important in this kind of undersea fiction . this was highly entertaining and informative , and the sequel , tiger reef , is even better . recommended .
1			tastes	modern	lot	wrong	job	good	it	slow	job	bad			a product of its time . i really hated giving this movie 2 stars . it had a lot of unrealized potential . from a scriptural perspective , i would give it a c . it got some things right , but a lot wrong or off . it did a good job with lazarus something most other movies skip , but a bad job with the disciples and the unscriptural representation of simon of cyrene carrying the a production perspective , it wasn not too bad but the timing of the movie is dated . today we like faster paced action and the movie seems to plod along to modern tastes . in 1965 it may have been only a little slow . i have watched many of the jesus related films that are out there . and my recommendation is to go with the one by campus crusades in 1977 the jesus film or the lawrence olivier one jesus of nazareth .
2			i	best	book	good			excellent book on doves . this is everything i would ever want to know about the care and maintenance of these wonderful birds . i wish the print had been just a little larger in some places but overall it was a very good book on the subject , one of the best i have ever read .
1			people	wrong	sorbo	good			kevin sorbo is a damn joke . what is wrong with you people ? kevin sorbo is good ? kevin sorbo is the king of b movie garbage and lousy television . give me a break . if i m going to watch an awful sequel to a movie that was awful in the first place with an even lousier actor replacing the lead , i will opt for the substitute 2 and treat williams any day .

1			band	great			i don not get it maybe i m too uncool . the velvet underground is a favorite of mine . they became a great band after this mess was recorded . i try listening to it once in a while to see if it has anything to offer and i come up empty . the singer nico does a decent marianne faithfull impression when she's not sounding like she's about to drift into a heroin coma .
1			product	terrible	stars	stars no	design	poor			terrible product ! should be zero stars in the review , but it will not accept 0 very hard to insert the batteries , poor design and cheap materials . weather channel selector is hard to noaa alerts are not received by the radio . weather stations are not set correctly , you can hear bleeding from other weather channels . would not recommend this item .
2			phone	great	phones	great	rechargables	regular	voice	clear			love it but . it's a great phone . i think all dect 6.0 phones are great but this one take sthe cake . uses regular aaa rechargables . i will not buy a phone that uses a proprietary battery . crystal clear voice and the range of reception is minor proble ms if you answer in this phone and someone picks up an extension , this one disconnects . i have the base and one extension . the other problem is very minor . if the time a call is received is between 10 m and 10 59 pm , the time is shown in hexadecimal notation as 0 00 thru have told me they are working on a fix for the disconnect problem .

2			songs	great	disc	great	band	good	tracks	great	song	hot	start	best	band	entire			rainbow eyes . undoubtably , my favorite release by ritchie blackmore's rainbow . this disc features one hot song after another , combined with blackmore's refined guitar work and dio's energetic vocals . the entire band at this point was so good , long live rock is a veritable feast for the listener's ear . swords and sorcery is alive and well here with great tracks like gates of babylon and kill the king . dio's voice is supreme on long live rock n roll . other great songs are lady of the lake , la connection , and sensitive to light . if you have made it past finyl vinyl and best of rainbow , now it's time to pick up the best of what didn not make those discs . long live the best start you can make to fill that hole in your collection . truely a great disc !
1			comer	new	it	difficult	book	good			still trying to figure this out . the book would be good for someone who has started the programming of abap / 4 however if you are a new comer to this you will find it difficult and having to flip to this chart on page ? then to this chart on page ? makes it even more difficult . if you want to learn the basics this is not the book to buy . after i learn somemore in the programming stage of my training i might make a new if your a beginner to sap as i am stay away from this for now !
2			cd	new	it	great	they	great			wonderfully dark masterpiece . i just bought murder , and i have been listening to it all day . i don not really like country music , but after hearing the double cd man in black , i became interested in johnny cash's music . i really like the new themed cd's and when i found out about this one , i had to get it . all the songs have a story to tell , and they are all great . i can not wait to hear the love album , but i m sure it will be just as great as this one . five stars all the way .

1			accounts	contemporary	gospels	new	victims	available			milk the christians time is here again . this book is a notorious fraud from the 19 h pretends to be contemporary accounts of the death etc of jesus . actually they are all bogus . the editor expanded this book into the archko volume , but was caught because he created some of his ancient documents by copying verbatim from the novel ben hur . the motive appears to have been money , and the intended victims rural christians with no way to check his details are available in e . j . goodspeed's strange new gospels , which is online . in the late 19 h century a fair few people had a go at making money this way , targetting different groups . mahan's effort is the only one still circulating , but goodspeed details a collection of them .
2			buy	great	styling	great	maui	high	shades	best			5 stars if polarized , but best shades for price . having lost , stepped on , sat on , dropped , thrown , scratched the heck out of , and / or otherwise come to part with many , many pairs of sunglasses , i now have one rule nothing over $ 100 unfortunately , this doesn not leave many options between the mall kiosk knock offs and the high over priced maui jims , et al . fortunately , wiley x fills that void quite 120 have quality ansi rated glass , hinged temple pieces another must for me , and great styling . wiley x also makes a number of similarly priced models with different shapes / lens colors . my one complaint is that they aren not polarized . i bought my first pair at an optometrist's and over paid compared to on line prices . in spite of that , i still think they are a great buy , and as soon as i finish this review , i will be buying another replacement pair .

2			sharon	recent			better than the recent sharon mccones . i have been disappointed in the last few sharon mccone novels as they seem somewhat lackluster , although i very much enjoy the series as a whole . this book has an energy and mystique missing from muller's last few novels . excellent read , hard to put down .

2			anyone	interested	translation	direct no	novels	graphic	kill	big			minor corrections . for anyone who is interested in reading the graphic novels of this movie after watching it , which i highly recommend , the three books are sin city , the big , fat kill and that yellow bastard . as a fan who has read all three of those stories many , many times , i simply felt that the proper titles should have been given , since the editorial review , and another review mixed up the titles . marv was in sin city , hartigan was in that yellow bastard and dwight was from the big , fat kill . unfortunately , this was not a direct translation , and as always , the books are far better . i look forward to the director's cut to see if some of my favorite lines that were absent make it in . at which point the movie will reach five stars .
1			series	great	customer	satisfied no			boo on exchange policy . hey , great series . however this is the second time that amazon has delivered a set of dvds where one is severely damaged . no noticable marks / scratches but disc will not play and freezes up system . returns for full refund are only if item has not been opened . the exchange policy requires return for half refund and then you have to buy it again at full price . very dissatisfied customer .
2			movie	typical			works from 4 rooms away . works from 4 rooms away and through several walls . not as fast as maybe you would like but it works . 30 minute tv show might take 15 minutes . typical movie will take longer . i clocked mine at about 40 minutes sometimes faster depending on the qulity you recorded the movie at . higher quality will certainly be a larger file and take longer . leaves a copy of the origional on the tivo the file was transfered from . also great not to have to have a phone line connected once you get this connected to your broadband network . i use a linksys wireless b / g router and i have one linksys wireless range extender which i am sure helped this thing reach 4 rooms away . wish it were faster and had longer range ability but that is the limit of g / g need n wireless and an n device from tivo or whoever makes this for them .

1			surplus	social	ventures	military	development	social	production	social	differences	essential	relations	social	relations	current	success	social	making	social			progress of civilization . the problem with attributing human social development to externalities is that it glosses over the essential differences between all societies that is how labor is socially organized and who decides how to allocate and use the social surplus . while geography tempers social development , it is the method of social production that is the overwhelming determinant of social success . slave societies out produce hunter gatherers . feudal out produces slave , and wage labor out produces slavery and feudal is more more instructive is how current social relations restrict and hamper social development by wasting social production on useless activities like military ventures and individualized social decision making . for example individuals riding in cars instead of individuals sharing mass transportation , a more socially efficient transportation system .
1			it	easy	container	tight no			great for ants and slugs . i have used this container for a couple of years . it definitely makes it easy to pour food into bowls . as another reviewer said , filling the container is a little awkward , because the handle will not stay closed without any food in the dispenser . this container is not air tight , so expect bugs !
1			toy	great	press	good no	press	best	waste	complete	son	old	it	worth	hands	strong			complete waste of money ! i am an able bodied cook with decently strong hands . i have been using garlic presses for 14 years . i couldn not get a single piece of garlic , peeled or unpeeled to mince through this thing . i asked my husband , with stronger hands , to give it a try and he was able to make it happen with considerable force . after a week of frustration and sore hands , i gave it to my five year old son to have . he would probably rate it at three or four stars because he thinks it is a great toy and it does a superb job of shooting play doh through the holes . in my experience , when buying a garlic press you should buy one that has prongs that grasp the garlic while pushing it through the holes . in my opinion , this is definitely not a good garlic press . the best garlic press i have ever owned was from ikea . it finally just broke and i miss it dearly . it's almost worth driving four hours to get another !

2			situations	difficult	book	good			very helpful . a good reference book for any babysitter / nanny / daycare worker . i have referred to this book many times when faced with difficult situations . i highly recommend it .
1			ending	ok			first book by this author , not sure i would read another . to sum things up , this book could have been cut in half at least ! and gotten the same point across . i almost gave up on this book a few times , but for some reason kept reading . the ending was okay but everything leading up to it was long winded . this was my first book by jodi picoult and i honestly don not think i would read another by her , sorry to say .
1			shipping	free	deal	good			gonna make a fortune . i have been searching for a bargain printer for my office until i saw this one . good deal . what can you complain for a $ 50 printer . but shipping kills the deal . hey , seller , can you offer free shipping .
1			audience	regular	god	dead	it	necessary			don not bother . i do not know ms williams , and this was the first of her writings i read . i will not read any more . others have done this genre better , without stooping to a world view that inculcates so much that is gratuitously evil . writers like randall garrett have been able to successfully blend both christan and pagan aspects , without denigrating either . i felt it ironic that while christian icons were used to repel evil , ms williams found it necessary to mock christ the dead christian god . i am sure her regular audience would expect nothing less of her i will not be counted among them .
2			push	little	store	local	stores	local			the best there is . not easy to find in local stores , but easily available from amazon and promptly delivered . ahh , just the right size , with lids that fit properly and can be put on securely with one little push to the center of the lid . what a benefit and much , much more satisfactory than any of amazon's local store competitors . easy to keep clean and to store , too .
1			word	important	i	happy	you	unique			maybe for others , not for me . this book is very conversational in style with footnote references on nearly every page that explain or defend ueland's ideas or judgment . i almost felt as if i were reading a book written by a teen . apparently there are many would be artists of every sort , writers in particular , who have no confidence to even begin their art . after the first chapter , i began reading the book faster and faster because i got tired of reading the refrain you are unique , you need confidence etc her editor didn not catch an important missing word and the passages included for demonstration are in the same font as ueland's , so often it is cloudy whether the paragraph is a continuation of the quote or ueland's words . i am happy for those who were inspired by ueland's suggestions . the ideas were valid , just overstated .

2			memories	recent	story	great	feel	good	music	good	movies	best	acting	great			great acting , direction , and overall feel , you will like it . blow is one of those movies you watch twice at the movies , and the buy the dvd . its one of those movies that has that it that makes you feel good about paying to watch it and about paying to buy the dvd . the whole story is great and the script is very , very well developed ; fast paced but never loosing its sense of order ; the lessons it teaches about life and about destiny will impact you , mostly because of the great acting by depp and liotta ; and the movies follows itself throughout with good music and greatly created scenes . blow is by far one of the best movies in recent memories , and its actors , screenplay , and storyline make it what it is .

2			one	easy	bits	humorous	wit	enjoyable	character	good	characters	main	moments	good	dialogue	enjoyable			andrews , parson , and fanny . this book was assigned to me in my british literature class for a book club . shortly after being assigned this book , i quickly went out and began reading it . while fielding's writing style does seem to run on a bit , his narrative wit and dialogue is enjoyable . i found myself liking the three main characters , parson adams in particular . he told some interesting stories , and has kind of an older brother relationship with joesph , making him a good side character . the brief moments of action were pretty good in the story , as were the humorous bits . its easy to see why this novel will go down as one a classic in literature .

1			it	hate	story	ridiculous	read	entire	read	bad	moody	proud	book	entire	book	funny			tries too hard . i hate it when an author makes it painfully obvious how much thought he put into certain things . names , for instance . hex raitliffe oh i get it ! hex , because he's unlucky and things go wrong ! not clever , and certainly not one of the initial turn offs , but the error sets the tone for the entire book . many reviewers complain about lack of readability . that's because rick moody is very , very proud of his writing ability , and overdoes each sentence to death . long , windy sentences with lots of colorful adjectives does not always make well written prose . in fact , it rarely novel got so bogged down in its own ridiculous story that i not only lacked any sympathy with the characters , but felt like i was looking over the author's shoulder as he intended them . the attempts at humor , such as the lovemaking scene , just fell flat . i didn not even crack a smile throughout the entire read , which is pretty bad for a book that really , really wants to be funny .

1			i	disappointed			drip drip drip . not what you want from a springform ! i have used one of these for a long time i like the glass bottom , though it was never a particularly tight seal . after living for a while with a cheapo ikea pan in my other kitchen i commute 1100 miles and unfortunately have two of many things , i finally decided to spring for a nicer pan , so to speak . the first one arrived and was all scratched up , so i returned it and got a second one . filled that one up with water , and indeed , drip drip drip drip . it's from where the collar joins , since indeed , the outer side of the ring has to be looser than the inner side . batter won not drip through it or anything , but butter in a crust , or juice from baking fruit might . it's not actually worse than the cheaper pan , so i decided not to return yet another one . but i m quite disappointed , since i was hoping that by shelling out the cash for a fancier pan , i might get a relatively drip proof one .
1			quality	literary	piece	great			formatting errors . though i do not doubt the literary quality of this great piece of literature , in this ebook , the formatting and proofreading quality wast for waste . is horribly distracting and is frankly terribly annoying .
1			works	finest	things	great	reasons	literary			yawn . this is said to be one of nadine gordimer's finest works , and she is a nobel prize winner , so i hoped for great things when i picked this one out at the bookstore , unfortunately assuming that the nobel prize would be a guarantee that i would love it . well , i didn not love it . while indeed a competent storytelling , i don not really regard this as literature . there is not the fire , imagination or creativity one expects , nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers . i managed to get to the end , but i can not say that i felt or learned anything at all . it makes me wonder if there were political , rather than literary reasons that caused the nobel comittee to honor this author .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			sweet , easy reading . i have not read freethy before but found her writing style easy and enjoyable . the story developed the characters and the setting well however i would have found it more interesting if greater sailing detailing was given . overall i feel that the messy lives that we all can have were warmly depicted in this family's story .
2			character	main			read this amazing novel . view from a burning bridge is elequant , suspenseful , hilarious , and heart breaking . it is one of those books where you are instantly brought into the world of the main character . once you begin to read this story , you won not be able to put it down , and the story stays with you . i highly recommend everyone to buy it today !
2			writing	outstanding	page	real			a very fast pced book with outstanding writing ! this book was the first batteltech book i read , and it realy gets you going . a real page turner . this book is fast paced with lots of action . the writer puts you in a elit pilots point of view when he becomes traped in a gurilla war . must read ! good for begginers .
2			gpu	old	card	great	graphics	crisp			great pci graphics card . i bought this card for it's resolution capability for my widescreen monitor 16 10 . the card fully supports the resolution i needed and presents better color representation and graphics than the stock gpu that came with my computer . the graphics are more crisp and the colors are vibrant . you can easily change the settings for the color and luminosity by using the nvidia control panel . installing the card was easy and i just had to turn off my old gpu and download the latest driver from nvidia's website . after i restarted , my computer was ready to card is a deal for it's price and quality .
1			formula	predictable	bet	bad			a minority report . i sat down with a friend to watch this dvd and after about thirty minutes , we gave it up as a bad bet , so i can not claim to have seen the whole thing , but after a beginning like that , i doubt it was going to change my mind about the , maria bella was gorgeous and charming . yes , the violence was generally well shown . this is what happens when someone takes a round through the top of the head and much of their face is blown off or when someone has the septum driven into their the other hand , the pacing seemed glacial , the formula as predictable as a date with a prostitute , and most of the characters disposable .
1			toppik	little			great in your 40 s . my hair dresser introduced me to toppik to go along with my rogain . both are great but together over time they have cured 80 of my hair loss isses which is amazing . a little toppik on your scalp dulls and colors your exposed skin and thats all i needed to solve the ballance of my issues . works good
1			i	disappointed	jargon	technical	ending	ok	ending	worth			i must have missed something . because i didn not like this book at all . it was bogged down w / technical jargon . it didn not refer to the underlying intrigue enough . the only reason i continued w / the book is because i kept thinking it would get better . the ending was okay , but not worth reading all the other boring chapters to get to it . this is the first crichton book i read and i was very disappointed .
1			it	due	excuse	poor	anime	original	enemy	worst	hunter	original			pitiful . i have been reading the reviews . and noticing how everyone who gave it not op marks saying it was hylarious , not he bets movie ever , and so on and so forth , have never seen the original anime , or even better , read the they had i m sure none of those people would give it more than it's due 1 star for j . c . fans , maybe 2 . this movie is a poor excuse for an adaptation . and a disgrace for the original city hunter . jackie chan as saeba ryo ? puh lease ! the attempts at manga / anime humor fall on barren ground and turn the movie into an even more of a farce as it already is . i wouldn not recomend this movie not even to my worst enemy and i agree with the reviewer who said when you die and go to hell , satan makes you watch this movie . i can not imagine a torture greater than that . i would take boiling oil any time !
2			fave	personal	reason	good	tracks	best	cd	great	holidays	happy	tacks	great			one of if not the best cd out there . this cd is great . it has 13 of the best tracks ever created . i know everyone says chereshire cat and dude ranch were better ive never heard em but take off your pants and jacket is still a great and trully wonderfull cd . it has 13 great tacks anthem pt . 2 online songs personal fave . first date , happy holidays , story of a lonley guy , the rock show , stay together for the kids , roller coaster , reckless abandon , everytime i look for you , give me one good reason , shut up and plese take me home . buy this cd know , along with eenema of the state , dude ranch , the mark , tom , and travis show , chershire cat and bhudda .
1			it	safe	pieces	tiny	teeth	old			doesn not teach baby to eat safely ! unless your child has a feeding issue that prevents thenm from eating solids this is a waste of money . my son started to eat solids that were not pured before he even had teeth , ask your pediatrician , they can tell you that until your child has molars that chew with their gu ms first he started with cheerios , they will melt in your babies mouth , and yes he did gaga little , but a nurse told me that is normal and part of the process of learnign to eat . when he mastered that i introduced other foods . to make it safe i just cut his food up into tiny pieces about the size of a cheerio . he only has 4 teeth now at 12 monthes old but he eats what we eat , just cut up the pieces can be larger now .
1			plant	real	engineer	experienced	insight	little	book	useful	analysis	functional			the does not provide insight into the subject of control . with the exception of one chapter , this book is about a narrow and unproven approach to control system design the l 1 theory . there is almost surely no real life plant that carries a controller based on this design . additionally , the authors present a mathematical treatment of an engineering subject , but the treatment fails to give the experienced control engineer any the point of view of mathematical control theory , the book is simply a watered down version of a few topics in infinite dimensional optimization and functional analysis . it is based on an application of the hahn banach theorem to a formulation of the control problem . it also contains a lot of mathematical facts , but it does not tie them well to control theory . so the mathematician will get little insight into the subject of we have a book that is neither useful to the engineer , nor to the mathematician .
2			containers	great	they	small			freeze it . i found these containers great for storing brest milk in the freezer . they are small and dont take up to much space . the also fit perfect from freezer straight to the bottle warmer . i recommend this product for mothers who will be breast feeding and returning back to work .
1			deal	great	vase	nice			disappointed . very disappointed . the quality and color depicted in the photo does not accurately represent the condition of the vases i received . i thought i was getting a great deal on a nice vase , but that's not the case . i got what i paid for . not much .
1			description	original	advertising	false			the original description was inaccurate . i bought this for my wife at christmas after doing a search for frames with a usb port so that she could load some of the pictures that she has stored on her laptop . the original description said it came with a remote and the port , actually it came with neither . all in all the picture quality is decent for the price , the flash storage is something that you usually don not find on frames in this range , and now i see that i wasn not the only person taken in by false advertising .
1			hunter	basic	hunter	good			elk hunter seriew vol . 1 . i was hoping that is was not a paid advertisement for rocky mountain elk foundation but that pretty much what 1 2 the video is . nothing against jay he did a very basic and good over view for the very beginner elk hunter . not worth the price that is for sure . it should be given out for free . sorry just the way it is .
2			stars	nice	words	good	decemberists	free	whimsy	theatrical			slight disappointment . i really set myself up to be disappointed with the crane wife cause i bought the pre release hype . after reading all the good words , i was expecting to be blown away . then after a couple of listens i realized i had had tricked myself . the decemberists aren not the kind of band that blows people away . the decemberists are a band that charms you and soothes you with loving songcraft and theatrical whimsy . crane wife didn not inject directly into my blood stream like the infectious picaresque my first of the band's cds . in fact , some two weeks later , crane wife is still slowly soaking in . i dont hear the adventuresome and free spirited decemberists i have grown to love . in fact collin even seems a little more uncertain in his singing on crane wife . not the lyrics , just the execution . when the war came , yankee bayonet and shankhill butchers are standouts . 4 stars is being nice .
2			hopelessness	excellent	range	great	insight	social	life	real	insight	real	discussion	sexual			insightful and honest . john o hara is like a cross between f . s . fitzgerald and d . h . lawrence , if you care to think of it in those ter ms not only do i recommend the book for its social insight into the club set of the 1930 s like fitzgerald , but i also recommend it for its brutal honesty . o hara , like d . h . lawrence , could take any character , a woman , a man , a priest , an alcoholic , and tell you what they would do , why they would do it , and what they would think while doing it . we know the lies that they tell themselves , simply because o hara knows them and would never let the character get away with lying to his readers . he knows the ins and outs of every kind of mind . in effect , we feel the jealousy , anxiety , anger , and hopelessness of a great range of book is excellent for those readers who are a little weary of carefully non offensive works . prepare for some 200 pages of frank sexual discussion , real mental insight , and a story that ends the way it would in real life .
1			complaint	common	i	disappointed	use	hard	it	great			couldn not load music on it . i had a zen touch 20 b that i loved , but after 2 1 2 years of hard use , it stopped working . so , i bought this one . it was great when i took it out of the package . i downloaded all the programs and hooked it up to the computer to charge . after it finished charging , i tried to download music on it and i couldn not . no matter what i did , my computer would not recognize the player . i kept getting messages that the player was not detected . i tried another computer and i got the same results . after researching the problem and calling the company , i found out that this is a common complaint with this product . i am so disappointed and i am returning it .
2			work	best	it	great			it's great ! possibly maybe best work ever done by bjork , post is a crossover of idm , trip hop and whatever dance music in the middle 90 s is meant to the marvellous orchestration of isobel , to the exuberance of i miss you bjork proves there's nothing she can do less than perfect
2			story	classic			children's book . my husband and i adopted our daughter who is liberian . we try to find diverse books for her and this one was a gift to her for her 2 d birthday . she loves the pictures and the story is a classic a great bedtime reading story .
1			paper	original	improvement	noticeable			where's rhino when you need them ? this review is for the audio fidelity release of this album , not for the album itself . i had been patiently waiting for years for this album to get the same deluxe treatment as rhino gave billion dollar babies . what a disappointment it was to discover that love it to death , my all time favorite alice cooper album , was in the hands of audio fidelity . i , regrettably , purchased their edition of school's out when it was first released in 2009 and couldn not believe that that was the best they could do for the price they were asking . not that i was expecting them to replicate the original paper panties of the vinyl version , but a bonus cut or two or even a booklet with liner notes would have helped justify the price . the barely noticeable so called improvement in sound quality alone was certainly not worth it . i would love to know why rhino dropped the ball on further alice cooper reissues .
2			intro	great			simple , effective and suffices ! 20 ins of simple disciplines daily simply works . simple , effective and suffices ! 20 ins of simple disciplines daily simply works ! ! at $ 2.70 what a steal . bought mine for $ 27 10 years ago . if something works , it never goes out of date . great intro into pilates . you don not need the fancy gadgets though that would be nice that's all .
2			material	excellent	quality	great			essential . if you love rl , you will love this disc . it wonderfully augments his produced albu ms the recording quality is great considering that these are not studio recordings . the material is excellent and varied . highly recommended .
1			plot	repetitive	piece	historical	dialogue	repetitive			lower your iq . the book reads like it was written for a fifth grade reading level . if this doesn not bother you , then maybe the immature character development will . the characters are all so wooden . anne is the conniving , overly ambitious coquette and her sister mary is the unwilling courtier who longs for the country . to the author i get it already ! how many more pages are you going to repeat this theme ? dialogue and plot are so repetitive and there is virtually no character development . i was just looking for an entertaining historical fiction piece written with some sophistication for adult readers . if you are really desperate , stuck in a hotel room on your vacation , then this book may do .
1			cd	next	rappers	good	rapper	good	lyrics	suck	core	hard	he	popular	cent	worth	cd	horrible			50 cent is worth just that . this cd is horrible ! the lyrics suck , i can make better beats on my computer at home ! hey 50 you kicked out da game for not having your back on your beef with fat joe , nas and jada . jennifer lopez did a single with joe ! so she must be takin sides ! you gonna diss her on your next cd ? i m sure that will give you some more street cred to diss jlo , i mean shes hard core ! and your boy eminem did a single with jada . wanna explain that one ? the only reason he's popular is cause of the hype everyone makes about him , so 's from the streets , that doesn not make him a good rapper . 90 of rap sucks anyway , very few good rappers left . it's all pop rap now , it's sad . candy that has to be the worst single this year ! don not buy this cd , you will regret it
2			character	disappointing	it	good			wonderful adaptation . i loved this adaptation of sense and sensibility and thought it was every bit as good as the emma thompson adaptation which i also love . i enjoyed the fact that they included more of the characters from the book and added more details to the story . the characters were closer in age to the book and i thought it was cast very well . the only character who was a bit disappointing was dominic cooper as willoughby . i had something more handsome and charming in mind as in the 1995 version , but he does grow on you and is the type of character that you can really despise . over all it is a wonderful movie and i am sure to watch it over and over !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			hollow . a more meaningless , pointless and badly written book i haven not come across . utter lack of depth to the characters and storyline .
2			marine	lucky	marine	young	it	repetitive	marine	good	weapon	ultimate			fighting the japanese . this is a rivetting read and an insight into the mind of a good young american marine who was very lucky to have survived the war . it confirms my view that the us army is far more complacent about throwing men into battle regardless of the cost in life . this is in comtrast to the british who , with a fifth of the us population , can not afford to waste book also makes one question more earnestly than does the author the necessity , after the summer of 1945 of invading the islands and suffering horrendous losses . some islands could well have been bypassed and blockaded especially as , by then , the american government knew it was about to unleash the ultimate weapon . i give it four stars bcs it tended to be repetitive .
2			adventures	fun			i married adventure review . the most exciting thing about this book was it all really happened . martin really did meet jack london , martin really did take pictures of cannibals , osa and martin really did discover a lake in africa . the adventures were thrilling and fun .
2			review	previous	computer	new	sam	serious	system	new	ati	new	drivers	current	review	good no			radeon 8500 second chance . well my previous review for this card was not good . but i just built a new , faster computer and put the radeon to the test again . my new system is as follows tyan trinity 510 mb using the current via 4 in -1 drivers , pent -4 1.8 hz 478 pin , radeon 8500 of course , 256 eg ddr pc 2100 ram , wd 20 gig 7200 rpm hd , soundblaster pci 512 sound , antec full tower case w / 300 att p / s , and the standard cd , ups , etc my cooling of the system is provided by 1 cool slot fan , 3 80 m fans , and one pci slot exhaust fan under the radeon . after upgrading to this system and reinstalling the radeon with the current 6071 drivers i have a new found love for this ca rd serious sam se plays like a dream and actually looks better than my gf 4 mx card ! aliens vs . predator 2 ditto . word of advice , this card was designed for faster systems 1 hz and up with the motherboards supporting 4 agp and fast writes . i think the new drivers ati put out recently has helped also . worth the money now that is .
2			songs	great	album	new			a more mature album . i thoroughly enjoyed this album . i could see why fans of twothirtyeight were reluctant to open up to it , because it is different . still , these songs are great . chris is a master songwriter that i and i m sure many others who know of him think is severely under rated . i think this is demonstrating his realization of his solo song writing skills where you can see that they are really going to blossom very soon . he seems to write in minimalist kind of way , with a less is more style compared to his other bands . he also has a new album ooming out that i am personally pumped for , based on his kickstarter samples . i would say this album is a must for any chris staples fan and any discover america / twothrityeight should give it a try as well .
2			lovers	classic			tension packed thriller . set in steamy key largo , this movie is a tension packed thriller . awesome acting performances by bogart , bacall , robinson and barrymore . a must see for classic film lovers . i highly recommend this film .
1			things	big	story	good	things	little	things	confusing	development	little	deal	big	it	ok	stories	predictable	idea	good	it	slow	book	good			an ok read . this was in my opinion a good story . however it was very slow . nothing interesting happens untill like halfway through the story and by then the stories super predictable . also , there was little character development . paul and his friend joey seemed to have several different mood swings and weren not very smart . the book was overdramatic . several little things were made into a big deal big things that happened were brief and confusing . overall it was a good idea for a story but underdeveloped . if it were rewritten about the same thing and more development it would be a good book , however it was just ok
2			tenor	underrated	read	great			great read . this is a wonderful book about a very underrated tenor sax player . if your reading this you probably know some things about his drug / alcohol proble ms i won not bother you with those details . the book was brilliantly written . it's a fast read but not because of a lack of substance . it's a comprehensive book about stan getz and the jazz world in and around him .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			after 7 years still my favorite tool . i love my felco pruner ! i m now 68 years old and my pruner is aging along with me but still cuts like new . i am going to order some spare parts so my felco will last longer than me . i use it for trimming brush & pruning trees , cutting tips for wreath making and cutting flowers & vines . it does an excellent job . even though i m petite 95 lbs and have arthritic hands , i am able to use this tool with no problem . whenever i see my husband trying to borrow my felco from my toolbox , i remind him not to forget to return it to where he found it . i would be lost without it .
2			experience	great			who could take issue ? in the film noir gendre , who could ever have anything but a great experience ? with the all star cast , clever writing and interesting mix of suspense and too many weak those are easily forgotten .
1			i	new	reference	good	understanding	complete	job	good	i	experienced	java	readable			easy to read , but not a good reference . just java 2 is very readable , but it does not do a very good job of teaching java or oop . i would read a chapter and feel like i had a fairly complete understanding . but when i tried to apply what i learned , i always struggled . the problem for me was his examples are way too fragmented and incomplete . i spend lots of time reviewing faq sites for descent examples . i would not recommend this i am new to oop , but relatively experienced with c , ada , fortran ,
2			album	great	corcovado	worth	evening	nice	someone	special			corcovado is worth it . a great album for drinkin , dancin or just sharing a nice evening alone with that special someone . her take on corcovado is hands down the best ever done and is , alone , worth whatever price .
2			daughter	old	world	little	girl	little	kids	old	book	great			i lived in this book for a couple of years . it's a wonderful story that i loved as a child , and i am now reading it , over and over , with my 4 year old daughter . it is a great book for kids who are old enough to start hearing longer stories and who are learning to read . it's about a little girl who obviously doesn not have a lot of things or money reminds me of pictures of my mom from that time , she would have been about the right age but does have loads of imagination to create her own little world . but still would never leave her own . i didn not like that about it when i was a kid , but as a mother i find that part very appealing ! but i wanted to point that out .
1			one	good no			duck and cover . duck and cover , take the money and run , etc are some of the phrases that come to mind when i think of how i would describe this movie . no , more correctly these are phrases that would describe why mel gibson would ever make a movie like this . they had to drag me to the theatre in the first place to see this film . luckily i needed no such assistance when the film ended . seriously , this is a very forced comedy and not a very good one .
2			addition	great	transaction	easy			chocolate harry potter frogs . item was exactly like description . easy transaction and speady a great addition to the harry potter birthday party . chocolate frogs were a hit . and easy to make .
2			way	great	book	best	teaching	common no			best book i read in 2007 . the rare jewel of christian contentment is the best book i read during 2007 it caused me to think about whether i was really content with the circumstances god had given me or not in a way that is not the common teaching heard in this century . it was originally written in the 1600 so it takes concentrated thought to read it but it is a great way to take your mind off the exercise bike at the gym .
1			author	good	waste	big	ive	worst	ending	stupid	book	hate	it	bad	book	horrible			this book was horrible ! it is really really really really bad ! she sally j freedman is always talking about hitler and how he is going to skin her and bathe in her blood ! she is also always talking about really boring stuff . you would think the book would get more interesting but its boring and really terrible all the way through . this is the worst book ive ever read and i read a lot . judy blume is a good author and i was really disapointed in her when i read this also has a stupid ending . as you can see , i really hated this book . dont read it ! its a big waste of time ! ! !
1			it	easy			out of the dust . i did not like this book because it was in poems and it dragged on and on . it was to easy like 8 -10 it was a sad book because billys mom died . it was about the dust bowl and it was borning again . once in the story her mom died and her brother dead and not being able to play the pianumber she got on a train and then her food got stolen then she got off . it was a slow book .
1			character	main			can not understand the positives on this one . i was really looking forward to this book but then found myself force reading to finish it . part of the problem is that i really took a dislike to the main character a completely worthless individual who all you learn from is how not to be . if you like to be inspired by stories this is not for you . i didn not even find it amusing are fart jokes really worth a pulitzer ?
2			album	old	songs	bad	it	great	album	great	abilitywith	vocal			kelly's coming out ! ! this album is great it really shows kellys vocal abilitywith out beyonce` and michelle and i recommand this to anyoneyoung or old it's great ! that's why on dec 4 2002 the riaa certified the album gold go kelly the only songs that are bad are 7.8 .9 enjoy !
1			book	little	it	appropriate	lecture	famous	jaques	best			no meat and no potatoes . . . i read the book in a little over two hours . in the title , sterling says he is envisioning the next fifty years . in fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years . in the introduction to the book he presents his seven novel aspects of the twenty first century . he does this using a character from shakespeare's as you like it ; jaques , who is best know for his famous lecture , which begins with all the world's a stage and ends with sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything . it would have been more appropriate if sterling had used shakespeare's much ado about nothing . sterling tells us he is both a science fiction writer and a futurologi st i know a futurologist when i see one , and sterling is no futurologi st
1			idea	good	fan	big			some people are orphans with two parents . i just don not think it is a good idea to advertise the factthat many parents haven not a clue about protecting their that children are so very book is written well enough and all , but being a big fan ofjames barrie and tales about fairiesdoesn not endear this book to grow up way too fast in this society as it is . innocence once gone , is gone forever .
2			king	complete			the complete king . wonderful compilation of elvis work from the early to final the advances in recording technology over his career .
1			things	horrible	character	main	people	horrible			one of the few books in my life i couldn not finish . this book is the humor and intellectual equivalent of jersey shore . it's nothing but horrible people doing horrible things . being somewhat ocd , i have difficulty not finishing a book once started . however , the only reaction this book created was hatred for the main character . i couldn not continue to slog through ; try as i might .
2			the	old	the	young			makes a fun desktop decor to show others how you are feeling ! i would highly recommend this can work well at home or work to show others how you feel without verbalizing way to express your emotions . great for both the young and old ! very colorful and lots of feeling choices ! as a therapist , one could leave it out on the table for clients to express their feelings as well !

1			information	bad	cup	southern			many author errors on a single page . i just started reading teach yourself books beginner's spanish . i m on page 5 on which the authors write ll pronounced like the lli in million a is nearer to southern english cup than cap o as in pot never as in know or toe that's too much bad information for one book , let alone one page . authors or at least editors have a responsibility to check their facts . anyone following these authors advice would be unintelligible . i can not trust the rest of the book now and wish i could get my money back .
2			states	united	set	classic			just to clear some things up . the title northern exposure refers to a club night in england . they were really like a series of parties . i used to have this classic two disk set , however it was stolen when my car was broken into . i never got over that . i have purchased disk one seperatly , as thats how the disks were sold in the the united states it has an amazingly timeless quality and captures that moment right before trance broke on these one is the warm up down tempo affair . ironically its best served while comming down . these are classics . if you like electronica , you really should have these in your collection . you just should .
1			film	good	twists	new	moment	original			unexciting science fiction . pretty people , decent acting and sexy . this should have been a reasonably good film but , unfortunately , it wasn not . the tale is a hackneyed retelling of other conquest by space aliens films and is slow paced at that . i found this a film in which i was waiting for a truly original gotcha moment but it never comes . instead it plays out like one of those demonic horror films in which a possessed child the anti christ is born to an innocent woman . i m truly perplexed . surely all the truly interesting possibilities of a conquest from outer space haven not been played out . why can not the writers figure out some new truly interesting twists ?
1			look	beautiful	i	excited	chairs	new	chairs	cheap			dining chairs . i was so excited when i received my new chairs . the were easy to put together and look beautiful . the durability of the chairs is questionable . you can not put much weight on the backs of the chairs while sitting . both of my chairs broke . it is almost like the pegs used in the assembly are cheap . they actually break into a dusty mess . which is kind of ironic , because the tag said that they are fine furniture . if i knew that the chairs were so cheap , i would have not purchased them .
1			i	disappointed	it	interesting	story	basic	film	interesting			an attempt to make the simple , complex . as a fan of highly stylized and unique films , i was looking forward to seeing punch drunk love . i must admit i was extremely disappointed . after watching it again and watching all the extras on the dvd , i have concluded the film makers knew they had a very basic and boring story , and the only way to make it more interesting was to thow in other things like the strange artwork and unexplained elements in the film like the pianumberadding all of these artsy elements might make people think the film was much more than it was a very basic story . unfortunately it doesn not its benefit , the film is very interesting visually , and the music works well throughout .
1			spiky	old	string	similar	poly	basic	string	good	spiky	new	school	high			not what it used to be . i used this string years ago 2002 sh when i was playing in high school and absolutely loved it back then . it was extruded formed in such a way that it had what could be called a series of cuts going lengthwise with the string in what could be seen as almost a star shape if you looked at the end of it . this string of the past could spin a ball to insane levels and would often rip the majority of the fuzz off of one after a set or two . now a days , their spiky shark is the string most similar to the old super smash spiky but it's subdued a bit . this new super smash spiky just has a series of what appear to be almost randomly spaced very i emphasize very shallow cuts across the string here and there . all in all i found it did nothing desirable for spin and played like your basic poly . so skip this and get spiky shark instead if you are looking for a good spin string .
1			movie	bad			my wife watched it . i didnt . so here are some more words to make this actually be able to submit i think the movie was probably bad .
2			lady	nice			genius . i know his daughter and play trivia with her on starchat on msn . trivia central she goes by the handle bisquequeen very nice lady and fun to play trivia with . her dad , john was mentioned in the movie goldfinger . he won 37 north american titles and 3 consecutive world championships in bridge and was also a backgammon genius . pretty tough to beat those odds !
2			tale	worst	flight	final			damn . this dvd was cooky and weird the one i really did nt like was the second reinneisance it was to much for me blood and boobs and i like gore but when the robot split the head open i could nt take it my favorites were kid's story , program , the 7 h one i forgot what it was called , and espcially final flight of the osiris this should be rated r too much suffering and people screaming while their blood sheds its sicking this is like terminator the human race is almost extinct and machines rule the earth number 9 was probably the worst tale of the matrix but im sick of writing so auf wiedersien
2			soundtrack	best			best soundtrack ever ! this definately entails what the show is all about . you can just picture exactly what situation the song will be played in . i would recommend this to any buffy fanatic !
1			scholarship	historical			do your research before you accept this as truth . patricia cornwell should stick to fiction as legitimate historical scholarship defeats her , her matter of fact claims are based on opinion not tangible evidence . the fact she spent six million dollars buying expert opinion to fit her opinions shows , i recommend anyone interested in her book visit the . website for a balanced view .
2			work	best	songs	great	album	new	single	next			what rock n roll should be . this cd is what rock music is supposed to sound springfield is truly a gifted musician who improves with each new album . sdaa is his best work without a song sounds different , unique from the one stand outs are the bluesy alien virus , every night i wake up screaming , jesus saves , will i ? and what should be the next single wasted . but again all 17 songs are great ! rick springfield rules ! this cd is highly recommended .
2			bandages	extra	scissors	small	room	little			truly lightweight ! i bought this kit for a backpacker trip through costa rica . it truly was light weight and took up little room in the backpack . i had to add a couple of things , like small scissors for cutting moleskin , and a few extra bandages , and there was plenty of room to put these in the kit . i have not had opportunity to test the water tight aspect of the kit , but based on my satisfaction so far , i have no doubts it will live up to this claim as well .

1			it	ridiculous	timeframe	short	hands	regular	gloves	tight			too tight for regular sized hands . these gloves are so tight , even my daughters thin hands could not fit in them . it is ridiculous that the company grandoe only gives you thirty days to make the return . if you travel with your gifts like i won not be able to send them back within the short timeframe . so i m stuck with gloves i can not wear . if you purchase not trust your hand up a size beyond that to make sure they fit . or better yet , don not buy them at all .
1			imagery	poor	tapestry	real	matter	normal	life	short	work	good	artefact	real	reviews	good			clumsy but mercifully quick to read . one of the advantages of a reading circle is departing from one's normal reading matter . hence i came to read my first and definitely last tracy chevalier novel . i know nothing of the pearl earring book or film . the poor imagery conjured up by the author does nothing to nourish the reader's soul . many good reviews seem to mention the book's link with a real tapestry just because a book has a real art artefact for inspiration does not make it a good work of short , life is too short to waste it on prose such as this .
2			elements	repetitive	moods	electronic	elements	musical			clock dva sound mirror . dark , electronic moods permeate clock dva's sound mirror . and while the musical elements of the tracks here are repetitive , that's part of their power the loops makes for a cumulative energy to the tracks . indeed , the second version of sound mirror , without the vocals , seems to better one , as the elements have a opportunity to build amongst themselves . the sonology of sex is much more driving and eerie , with its sampled narration of countess elisabeth bathory . but the long and moody , hacker takes the prize here . with its slow thump and quiet development , it has a creepiness that builds until you are completely lost in the machine .
1			sound	clear	tone	ok	price	low	recorders	expensive	cost	low	it	difficult	quality	low	tone	great			low price but low quality . i was attracted to this recorder because of its low price . i should have known better . the pitch is off on some of the notes in the higher registers and it is more difficult than most recorders to get a clear sound in the higher registers . the tone in general is ok but not great . i have owned several other wooden recorders a low cost pearwood recorder and two expensive moeck rosewood recorders . even the pearwood recorder sounded better .

1			way	foolish	manuscript	valuable	it	frustrating			a brainy moron . charles citrine is an author . the man isn not stupid . yet , like other leading characters in saul bellow's books , he lives his life in a foolish way . he has the kind of friends who eliminate the need for enemies . if he had a dog it would bite him daily , and he would feed title character , humboldt , is another writer , suffering from manic depression at a time when lithium wasn not widely prescribed . his gift to citrine is a manuscript , and is left to citrine after humboldt's death . the manuscript turns out to be valuable , but i doubt that it will straighten out citrine's life . he can be counted on to insure himself a complicated and unsatisfying life . it's frustrating to read about this intelligent dope .
2			it	good	attention	little			awesome . there are authors who cojure wonderful plots , but lack the writing skills to tell it well , and there are authors who can grab you with their writing and need pay very little attention to plot . steinbeck has created a vivid portrait combining both breath taking and rough lyricism and a wonderful plot to create a master piece of american fiction . with this book , steinbeck has single handedly described what life was for okies and has left no detail left out . for a seventeen year old to be saying this about the grapes of wrath , you know it must be good .
2			classic	true			compelling , thought provoking and timeless . compelling , thought provoking , and timeless , citizen kane captures the human essence . it is the story of a man who , taken away from his childhood and his parents , begins his career as an entrepreneuring newspaperman in his twenties . the film is tribute to american cinema with its brilliant photography and camera angles expressing symbolism . now that it is celebrating over 50 years of excellence , it is proven to be a true classic , despite its early criticis ms
1			diapers	new	they	great	blow	complete	outs	constant	pampers	ashamed			awful ! these diapers do not work at all ! we had been using pampers swaddlers and they are great . unfortunately , i saw that i could buy these for a few dollars cheaper and decided to try them out . they do not work . we have been using them for about a week and every time my son has a poopy diaper , it's a complete blow out . even when he is upright , it somehow leaks out the top of the back of the diaper . we had been using the swaddlers and only had one blow out in 4 months . maybe these diapers work with older children with firmer stools , but they do not work at all for us at this age . besides the constant blow outs , these diapers have a plastic , cheap feeling . pampers should be ashamed to put their name on them . so , instead of saving a few dollars , i m now buying new diapers even when i have around 200 of these diapers left .

2			googling	little	accidentals	new	accidentals	musical	place	great	pieces	short	ability	limited			great place to start . i have very limited , beginning ability on the piano and with reading music . this book is a wonderful place to develop and practice . the pieces do not start out overly simple and are progressively more complex . each piece introduces some new musical elements accidentals , key change , triplets , etc . all exercise both left and right hands . and all are enjoyable to hear . because the pieces are all fairly short , i began playing from memory more than from the written music . to counter that , i suggest playing three or four during a practice the way , with a little googling you can find midi renditions of these songs on the internet to compare with your playing .

2			trilogy	sophisticated	series	great	task	difficult	houses	big	series	similar	fiction	familiar	two	previous	ending	solid			a solid ending to a great series . beauseigneur accomplishes a difficult task ending this sophisticated , urgency packed end times trilogy . those familiar with christian end times fiction know how the book has to end . the author exposes evil , applauds righteousness , and mourns the multitudes who are deluded by the most ancient of enemies . while the author does better than most , in this genre , i found the first two books moved at a better pace than number three . this conclusion had slow spots , and occasionally was more obvious in exposing the author's viewpoints , than the previous two had the end , i loved this series and hated to see it end . my sense is that the author felt the same way . i hope beauseigneur is discovered by the big publishing houses . who knows , maybe he will do a similar series on the tower of babel ?

1			i	disappointed			it was a waste of my time and my money ! i was very dissapointed in this book . it seems to me that thomas harris only wrote this book so that there would be a sequel to the silence of the lambs . now that was a book that i could not put down and this is one that i had trouble picking up . i only finished it so that i could fairly review it . if you have not bought it don not waste your time and your money . the author could of done much better . i was truly dissapointed .

1			soundtrack	horrible	footage	additional	version	original	stuff	extra	skin	little	it	best			please put the original us version on dvd . like many others who discovered this well overlooked film many years ago , i was greatly disappointed in the director's cut . for starters , the us version's music score surpasses the european score by leapyears and this director's cut uses that cheesy synthesizery european score . secondly , the additional footage simply adds a little more pointless skin in the form of nudity , but adds little or nothing to the overall story except about 50 minutes of your time . it feels like it's dragging compared to the original us version and often gives you more information than you wanted sometimes it's best to not tell the audience everything and let them fill in the blanks themselves . the original us version is one of my favorite films of all times , but this updated director's version doesn not make my cut because the extra stuff is pointless and long and the european soundtrack is horrible ! !

1			singer	best			second best of the solos . paul stanley proved he could write songs with this album . what makes this album listenable is paul's voice . he is the best singer in the band . the music is well done as well . apparently , unlike gene , paul took this venture seriously . not as heavy as ace's effort and about a billion times better than peter's . then again , what album isn not better than peter's ?

2			coat	good	gloss	high	i	pleased			not exactly what i expected , but pleased . the color is more coral / orange than i expected , but i am pleased with it nonetheless . two coats of it will give you full coverage unlike other essie colors . looks good with the high gloss sheen , as well as with the matte about you top coat .

2			feel	great	boots	great	blister	little	them	dry	cushioning	hard	second	great	reviews	good	boots	best			great boots but a little narrow . these are probably the second best boots i have owned out of @ 3 dozen . i generally don not like adidas boots but i saw a lot of good reviews for the adidas copa mundial . first , yes they are very confortable and fit really nice with one exception . i think they are too narrow . not as narrow as puma boots , but too narrow for my comfort . i did develop a little blister on each foot but that was becasue i did not give the shoes enough break in time which you should always do . ps i finally broke these in faster by wearing them in luke warm water for 20 minutes and then letting them dry on my feet . worked great second , the sole cushioning could be a little better . i don not know if the cushioning on this boot is too hard or if it felt hard because of the narrowness of the boot . either way , it could be worse . overall , i really like this boot . it has great feel and fits like a glove .
1			flavor	natural			not what it used to be . i have enjoyed this tea for 25 years . something changed at some point . recently reading the ingredient list i noticed the second ingredient is natural flavor . what is it ? i wrote to the company and received a pat answer that it is a proprietary blend and they can not divulge the actual ingredients except to your enquiring physician . it could be that it is just an ordinary flavor enhancing recipe similar to msg or it could be worse . might our bodies think it unnatural ? do they mean natural as in from planet earth ? so i will be giving up my favorite tea . i think i am going to get some star anise , cinnamon , rose hips , and cardamom from frontier herbs via amazon instead .

2			one	small	notes	extensive	it	great	dynamics	racial	issues	racial			excellent read . i found this to be one of the most engaging books i have read in a long time . i read it in three nights and was sad when it was over . the author appears to have done a lot of research on this subject , amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book . it's great to read a book that is both well researched and well written . my only complaint , a small one , is that i wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew . unlike some authors , philbrick definitely didn not ignore this topic . but when the african american members of the boats die off and are eaten , one by one , i was totally incredulous . how could this have happened ? i thought philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved . perhaps , however , there really wasn not enough data to go on . anyway , as i said , i greatly enjoyed this book .
2			music	popular	composers	great			accept no substitutes or imitations . this is ella at her finest and reminiscent of her live performances . couple ella with great composers , lyricists , arrangers and orchestras and this is a classic for the ages . in popular music there are but two voices , ella and frank .
2			book	enjoyable	tone	great	book	great			i can not wait for the sequel . this book was so enjoyable . the spritual tone of the book combined with the reality of what spritual people go through and how they react was great ! i could not put it down . when i got to the last page and realized the book had ended , i immediately raced to my computer to send the author an e mail to find out about the next i have not written to an author in a long time , so you know this book was great ! i will be the first on line to purchase the sequel .
1			review	typical			annoying piece of plastic . instead of a typical review , i urge you to read the one submitted by blake scholl above . he said basically everything that i was going to , and i feel it's a 100 accurate account of the product . i love oxo , but this ice cube tray is a pain in the arse . its only redeeming quality is the fact that i can stack things on top of it because it is covered .
2			testament	new			an excellent commetary on a complex book . gregg's fair and unbiased analysis of four dominant paradigms regarding the book of revelation will serve as an invaluable guide to all those who are seeking to better understand this complex book . a must have for amateur scholars of the new testament .

1			demons	flat	characters	flat	book	entire	author	next			wasn not the best in the series . i read all the others in this series and enjoyed them , thoroughly . yet , this one left me wanting . the characters were flat and steriotypical . the action seemed forced . the entire book is of running , running , running . same scenes over and over , just in a different location . there are brief injections of the vampires and werewolves , but only very , very brief . the demons are also flat and are left with the impression of them being completely evil . which we learned in a darker crimson was not the case . overall , i found it a disappointment . i even had to force myself to finish the book , just so i would know what was going on in the next . hopefully , the next author picks up the strings and delivers something with more action and more well rounded characters .

2			charector	annoying	introduction	great	orleans	new	book	nice	gate	strong	circles	social			for fans of joesph heller . the charector is a little too annoying , and maybe that makes this book so appealing to others . if you enjoyed catch 22 you should find this pleaseing after you get through the first third of the book . it definantly takes so time to pick up speed but finaly manages a strong gate through the end . given the circumstances the book was written under , a story as interesting as the book this is a nice book that takes place in an time period of new orleans that is rarely charector who lives in a self absorbed world where he could solve any problem if only anyone would listen to him , stumbles in and out of fringe social circles and environs haphazardly leaving a wake of confusion while remaining ignorant of his butterfly effect all the would be a great introduction to dark humor and irony for a younger reader , but this may take a bit of pateince if you already have a firm background in vonnegut , heller , and the like .

1			tunes	catchy no	effort	great			cd won not play in player cd r ? this cd and another by the same artist will not play in my cd player which doesn not read cd r's . when i play it in a boom box it will work . the songs just don not appeal to my children or our youth group . the song lyrics are well written but the tunes themselves are not catchy to the kids . they seem to like colin buchannan's aussie praise collection much better . amazon doesn not sell it but does . great effort though by this couple .
2			musicians	best	cd	best	members	original			their best ever . this is the best testament cd to date . every song is incredibly cool , but d . n . r . is probably the be st it also has some of the best backup musicians in the history of metal steve digiorgio death , sadus , james murphy death , obituary , and dave lombardo slayer , in addition to the original members . what else can i say ? just buy it
2			i	happy	gadget	great	bags	easy	sealer	great			handy gadget . i have had my deni freshlock sealer for a few years and was so happy to find the replacement rolls here . the bags are stonger than they feel . works great for freezer or storage of many ite ms the deni sealer alone is a great gadget for re sealing frozen foods in the origanal store bags . just hold the edge of the plastic bag under the lid and seal . i use the easy to make bags for many uses , not just food . one of my favorite kitchen tools !
1			grooviness	real	brittwittery	average	guys	mediocre	performance	good	music	best			sorry to disagree with all the raves , but . these guys are mediocre at be st there is a flash of real grooviness here or virtuosity there , but their sound has no backbone . not at all at the same level with the best music of that era . . airplane , doors , hendrix , etc . it's just your average fuzzy brittwittery . if you are looking for something similarly dated and far more mindblowing , i would advise you to save your money and purchase a good performance of debussy images et estamps , or perhaps ravel ondine .

2			i	sorry	game	fine	sound	good	i	old	battles	slow	it	cool			hey give it some credit , listen to me . so far this game hasn not received any credit , well not start off the graphics are good , and the sound is good too . i haven not seen one glitch yet , i m sorry . the battles are some what slow , but you have to admit that it is cool to have an invitory and equipping ite ms if you find glitches , return your game ! my game is fine , and i m past moria . you can switch your characters , that is a really cool option . but the osund goes away in battles sometimes , thats not so fun . i like to have energy in my battles , but the battles are slow . that's why this game got a 7 out of 10 o and i m 14 years old , i m just not signed up with amazon . fun game for younger kids . graphics 8 out of 10 ound 6 out of 10 ameplay 7 out of 10 verall 7 out of 10
2			set	complete	i	happy	sister	old	part	best	they	small	stethoscope	real			complete set . i ordered this doctor's kit for my 4 year old and he loves it . i think the best part about it is that it comes with a variety of pieces to complete the doctor's set . some of the pieces have working parts . the blood pressure cuff has a gauge that spins when you pump up the cuff ; the cell phone and pager are both battery powered and make sounds ; the thermometer has a temperature display that can be changed according to the patient's condition ; and the stethoscope has a button on it that makes coughing sounds although , i wish it actually worked like a real stethoscope . i will probably buy one that is more realistic to replace this one . the glasses are a cute addition , however , they are too small to fit on my son . they fit better on his 1 year old sister . overall , i am very happy with this purchase . my son loves to play doctor and fix up his patients !
1			bit	informative no	bit	least no	purchase	worst			not even interesting . this is the worst video purchase i have ever made . i truly wasted by money ! it was not even the least bit informative or entertaining . although i would love to get my money back , i know it is utterly impossible . i would not recommend that anyone ever buy this mess . thanks a lot .
1			series	new	i	excited	it	worth no	they	confusing			now what i expected . i was so excited when lkh decided to write a new series . i have loved every other book that she has written for her other series . i was dissappointed in this book . i thought the charecters were underdeveloped , and the story line did not stay consistant enough to want me to read any other books in this series . there were two distinct story lines that did not get anywhere near resolved by the end and they were so confusing that it was not worth the read . as much as i love lkh's works i was dissappointed in this one .
1			problems	serious	i	disappointed	feel	sorry	behavior	odd	poor	poor			oh the melodrama ! poor , poor dysfunctional us ! oprah pick or not , this book was a waste of money . the author seems to have some talent , but there was only one sympathetic character in the whole book the woman with whom harley is sleeping , and even her behavior was odd at times . this is a family with some serious problems , and it seems as if they just whine and mope and feel sorry for themselves . harley comes across as some kind of half wit without sense enough to realize that his sisters need the care and guidance of someone much more mature and stable than he is . i was very disappointed by the ending , because with all the melodrama and carrying on , i was hoping for a better resolution .

2			powers	new	peace	total	artist	best	city	central	nations	old	cage	golden	utopia	new			welcome to the golden cage . world war three is over . nuclear weapons were not used , but just about everything else was . old nations have died out and new powers have replaced them . a nomad soldier , deunan knute , and her cyborg partner , briareos , have been taken from the ruins , out of the wastes , to utopia . a utopia called olympus , the central city of the new , even utopia has power struggles . will mankind be changed and became something better if nonhuman or embrace total peace at the cost of his spirit ? or will it all be destroyed again by uncontrolled emotions such as hate and greed ? or will mankind be able to find a way , a path that combines it all ? shirow is the best artist to help us ask the question and maybe the only one who can help us answer it .
1			plus	old			never again . two years ago i bought a zen nano plus for my son . he wanted something that would hold more music so i bought him a zen v 1 gb . within two weeks it froze up on him and he couldn not use it . i was able to bring it back to where i had bought it . then i upgraded even more and bought a zen 4 gb . after less than two months that froze up on my son and he hasn not been able to get it to work since . meanwhile , he gave me his old zen nano plus , which is still plugging along . i don not think i will buy a zen again , until they fix this problem .
1			sun	old	sun	lucky	brian	fresh	vibrations	good	songwriting	weak	letdown	big			pointless . in the 70 s , i fished a copy of the smiley smile lp out of the cutout bin . naturally , i enjoyed the pop side of it and endured the noodling . now , fresh off brian's triumphant that lucky old sun sept 2008 , i decided to get his re recording of the never quite released smile . well , it is a big letdown . there can be no possible reason to re do heroes and villians or good vibrations . the rest of it is pleasant and expertly played , but the songwriting is weak . i love brian wilson , but i don not need this pointless exercise .
2			dog	little	it	comfortable			love it ! i am starting my fifth month of pregnancy and bought the pillow to get used to sleeping on my sides . at first , i was scared of the size and concerned it might bother my husband and my little dog that sleeps next to me . i tried it and absolutely loved it . my husband cuddles up next to it and my little dog uses the pillow as well and sleeps in it with me . we joke around about the size , but it is really comfortable . it is a must have during pregnancy .

2			equipment	necessary			fits my 2011 subaru outback which has 17 tires . just received the cables today . i wanted to make sure my outback had the necessary equipment when going to the mountains . the owners manuals says chain are not allowed due to clearance . the web site advised these cables would be approved . i guess some subarus have 16 tires so when i bought these the web page said they would not fit my car . i just put them on and they fit perfectly and went on in a few minutes . if i should ever have to try in the snow i will write more .
2			they	catchy	liking	huge	moods	bad	i	dark			enjoyed cd . i had a huge liking towards this cd . i liked it , because of its haunting lyrics and were dark and unhappy . i found that it had reflected a lot towards my feelings when in states of bad moods . what i found was that during the first 5 or 6 songs , they are catchy , and had their own sound and originality to later in the cd , some of the songs were beginning to sound the same . i also found that you can listen to this cd for so overall i enjoyed it .
1			problems	serious	i	disappointed	deal	good	problems	hot	screen	terrible	pilot	new			serious problems with the palm m 505 . i bought my palm m 505 in september 2001 now it is less than 5 months later and i have experienced the hot sync problems everyone else is talking about . when i contacted palm , they said they know about the defect and have corrected it , but in the meantime , i spent $ 478 for a new palm pilot that doesn not work and the only thing palm will do for me is send me at my cost of $ 25 a refurbished replacement . seems like someone is getting a good deal here , and it's not me . i will never buy a palm product again . additionally , the color screen is terrible without the backlight on . i am sorely disappointed .
1			installment	final	dialogue	empty			the matrix revolting . the final installment of this trilogy is proof that cgi does not a movie make . plenty of mindless action scenes for you fake fight fans , lots of empty dialogue for you drama fans they tried to cover all the bases and succeded in covering none . this movie did evoke some reaction out of me i was yawning the whole time .
1			he	reliable			once again ! haven not we heard enough of this idiot ? he is about as reliable as a rock . nothing in this book is factual .
2			array	wide	set	solid	song	great	vocals	sweet	cd	cheap			where's a hooligan when you need one ? i caught wind of this track on a compilation cd a few years back , and though i have searched quite a bit , it seems dj hooligan doesn not do much in the realm of publishing though his name's all over bootleg tracks from the lounges and dance floors . the female vocals , though heavily synthed , are sweet and draw you in . these are complimented by the wide array of instruments that were chosen and used quite well heavy in the piano stringed instrument sounds with effects . all in all , i would recommend this one , since the cd's dirt cheap you are pretty much paying for shipping to get a solid set of mixes on a great song .
1			prices	cheap			first memory card to fail . normally , i don not write reviews on memory cards because i never had any fail on me . it always just worked with no issues . transcend will be the first one to take the crown , but it's the first to die crown . we had this card for about 2 years but only used it maybe 4 -5 times light use . on the 5 h time , we took our camera with this transcend card to cozumel and it just stopped working after about 20 photos . i m sad to report that the first half of our trip is now officially lo st thanks transcend . i now know why your prices are cheap .
1			characters	main			more ugliness from scorsese . could it have been any nastier ? those were my words upon walking out of the theater after seeing this raunchy , bloody mess of a movie that could just as well have been called gangs of boston . the killings got so absurd toward the end that many in the audience broke out laughing . scorsese decides all the main characters have to die a grisly death and ends with a nihilistic image that i suppose perfectly ties together the nihilism of this film . jack nicholson's performance aside , there's very little of anything to recommend in this excessive , overdone , failed attempt at a thriller . the plot twists get preposterous , and the relentless nastiness gets insufferable after about an hour .
1			rd	extra	place	new	rd	positive	difference	noticeable	fan	expensive			expensive fan . i like the design of this product . it is able to swivel from side to side and tilt up and down . it also runs pretty quiet even on high . it comes with an extra long co rd that is about as much positive as i can say about it . i was hoping to clear out some of the musty mildew smell i was greeted with upon moving to my new place . it has made no noticeable difference in the air quality of my apartment . i purchased one for a friend with my order , and he didn not pick his up for a few weeks . so i was running two of these units side by side for a while and still noticed no improvement in air quality . he placed his in a room with a litter box and it seemed to spread the odor around instead of eliminating it . the led's used to light the grid are very dim . it seems to me that the photo oxidation and ion production is very minimal .
2			favorites	personal	it	hate	song	best	way	great	it	average			off da chainz . yo , this album is off da chainz ! it is a lot better than people have made it out to be . when i bought , i thought it would be average . but almost every song on the album could be a hit . my personal favorites are gatman & robin eminem & 50 come strong on this track . bangin beat , a baltimore love thing i think is the best song . some deep sh , my toy soldier hard beat . tony yayo & 50 kill it , and hate it or love it remix g unit is fire on this track . great way to close . overall , this album is fire . not up to par with get rich or die tryin , but it is still one of the top albums of the year .
2			service	great	price	great			what a purchase . great price $ 99 for the pair . great service . i ordered these speakers thursday night and they were delivered saturday morning , and for free ! ! how do you top that ? as for the speakers , they replaced a pair of mourdant shorts i bought close to twenty years ago that have lost their ommf , these sony's are clean sounding and effortlessly powerful , i can not wait until thet have been broken in . you won not be won not need a sub woofer but maybe a hard of hearing neighbor .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the source of stress knowledge . start your acquaintence with stress from the source the first book that describes the though that the book provides the description from the biological point of interesting reading this is not a text book , more like a person's diary with explanations and clarifications for readers . then continue to stress without distress from the same author .

1			tale	nice			flush audiobook . this is a wonderful story but michael welch does not do it justice . unfortunately michael's voice gets suddenly loud and suddenly quiet . perhaps the sound engineer did not edit this recording ? listening to it is painful in the car if you turn up the volume to hear the quiet parts you are blown out of your seat when he suddenly gets way too that the accoustics are so lacking because it's a nice tale .
1			box	useless	illustrations	nice			beware magnets are made of paper over wood . these magnets are very cute bright colors and i love that the materials are non toxic . the animal illustrations are really nice . however , i was expecting magnets made of wood . the core is wood , but the face is paper , which comes off . disappointing . also , the wooden box they come in has no lid , so is pretty useless for storage .
1			album	ok	mc	great			expected more . the album was ok but i expected more from him . he proved me wrong when i said he was the south . consistency is every thing and appears only in great mc's . to be quite frank this album took buck out of my top five for todys rappers and out of my top 20 of all time .
2			music	good	instrumentals	wonderful			more like 4.5 stars . gybe are basically a neo progressive band and thus they tend to be a bit too pretentious . but i don not care a fig whether they pose as indie snobs as long as their music is this good . this ep consists of two suites the term track or , worse , song is definitely inapplicable , both of wich build up terribly slowly , so slowly that in fact after a while you will end up wishing they adopted a faster pace but that , again , brings us back to the pretentiousness business . the instrumentals are wonderful , sometimes they have an epic flavour , other times they are both soothing and evoking . well , needless to say , this is music that shouldn not be listened to before 8 pm , you wouldn not get in the mood otherwise . if you love ambient pop and post rock you can not definitely miss this release also try their latest effort ! ps try something by rachel's , the dirty three and silver mount zion .
1			use	commercial	jersey	new	looks	great			looks great , works great for a while . when i got this machine i was in love with it . it was rugged and out performed every other machine i owned . however , within a year it was on the fritz . there is nowhere in the usa for repair other than in new jersey . living across the country i wasn not about to ship the machine there so it might get fixed . i repaired the thing myself and got another 6 months out of it . finally too much started to go wrong with it . it is now in the pile of disgarded use our machines two or three times a day for multiple drinks light commercial use for a home . this machine should have been able to handle the volume , but service and parts are lacking , or a long time in coming . i am now going to buy a pasquini livia 90 to replace this machine . lots more money , but proven durability .
2			gem	underrated	gem	good			classic late 80 s angst . this is a very good , very underrated gem from the late 80 s mope rock scene . a re issue of their 88 us debut take pages from the smiths with a dash of cure / robert smith lyricism . catchy , byrdsy guitars , chamber influenced synths and uptempo pop sensibility mixed with accutely despondant lyrics see the worst year of my life or whirlpool heart . makes me remember doc martens , cigarettes and the hubris of youth .
2			ending	stupid	it	original	it	cool			traumatizing in a way . this movie scared my heart right out of my chest from the very beginning . i think it was just the vibe it was letting off , but it shur as hell scared me . but all in all , i liked it . thought it was pretty original and cool . the only thing that kind of gets me about it was all the plot holes and how it got a little confusing at times . also the ending was kinda stupid . other than that , an interesting story and all . a pretty decent and really spooky film . just should have been edited a little better thats all . i liked end .
1			make	ludicrous	costumes	ludicrous	directing	adequate			a badly dated sci fi film . heston plays the last man on earth . during the day , he prowls the streets of la in his mustang . however , at night he must be back in his upper floor apartment because zombie mutants come out in the the evening . both the acting and directing are barely adequate . during the day scenes , you can clearly see other autos and people in the distance the movie was apparently shot in los angeles in the early morning . the make up and costumes for the zombies are ludicrous . all the actors look glum and dour . i saw this movie when it was initially released and thought is was ok . unfortunately , it hasn not aged well .

1			story	worth no	characterization	thin			what's the point ? whenever i watch a movie , i ask myself this question why should i care about the characters and what they are going through ? the answer to that question is absolute nothing as far as garden state goes . the characterization is so paper thin that i half wished that sam and andrew will never see each other again . there is nothing sympathetic about story's hero andrew . he is just another loser who can not get his act together . his story is not worth telling . natalie portman did what she could with her role , sam . her presence is the only saving grace .

2			girl	old	reader	normal no	book	perfect			amazing for teens . i am a 15 year old girl and im not really a normal reader . i found this book and could not put it informed me in all the dangers of having sex before marrage and i think that every teen should read this so they know the is perfect for a parent with a teen who wants their teen not to have sex or to stop having sex . i cried many times throughout the book and when i was finished i wanted to just keep reading . this book is perfect for a person who is pregnant and thinking about having an sister read this book when she got pregnant and now she is about to have a baby girl for herself thanks to gianna . if you get a this book !
2			one	decent	development	decent	fan	large no	characters	alive	novel	next	it	necessary no	characters	major	book	great	book	good			good book . having read most of the dune novels , except the house one is pretty decent . it was very irratating at the beginning of this novel , how they kept repeating the information on manion the innocent having read the first in this trilogy and knowing the ending it was not necessary to continously repeat this . if i was not a large fan of the dune series i would probably have stopped reading the book because of this . character development was decent , but killing off almost all major characters at end of novel was surprising none the less . guess they didnt want these characters alive in the next novel . however having started to read the battle of corrin now , i understand why these characters were killed in all it is a great book to read , look forward to finishing the last of the trilogy . just wonder if they will try to write another trilogy in the dune universe somewhere .
2			highway	good	it	excellent	music	traditional			if you only ever bought one dylan album . this album came out at the peak of dylan's creativity . when he broke away from traditional folk music and broke into rock and roll , 2 albums stand out . highway 61 revisited and blond on blonde . both are excellent and contain some of bob's catchiest and thoughtful tunes . if you only ever buy one album of his , i would recommend blonde on blonde . i give it a slight edge over highway 61 revisited only because it is a double album . most people consider highway 61 revisited bob's crowning masterpiece and it is excellent but blonde on blonde is just as good and contains twice the music . get both if you can .

1			it	original	it	classic	movie	good	it	slow	pass	next			i should have rented it . this is one of those movies to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do . it's very slow , very predictable , etc , etc , just like most other so called horror flicks . waiting on hollywood to release a worthwhile movie of any kind is like waiting on the next pass of haley's comet . this is especially true with horror movies . the last time i saw a good horror movie was the descent . now that was a horror movie ! it was so original . so very unique . so well casted & directed , etc , etc it's already a classic . why can not hollywood make more movies like that ? so , while we wait on another the descent to be made , i guess we have to suffer with b level stuff like the echo .

1			part	bad	school	elementary	lyrics	reminiscent	inn	local			the bad part about music from the 1970 s . this album , as well as all of the other steely dan records , represent where music from the 70 s went sour . the 70 s did provide listners with an excellent array of artists . but with steely dan , we are left with yet another lounge jazz rock band , whom you are better off spending $ 4 for a screwdriver at your local ramada inn's bar and listening to their house band , than spending the $ 12 it costs to buy this , or any other steely dan cd . in simple terms , the music is corny and generic beyond belief . and the lyrics are reminiscent of an elementary school's poetry fair .

1			ms	proble	luck	good	feat	small	one	difficult	bit	little	text	classic	school	high			classic math text . i say classic because , like most math textbooks , this one is difficult to understand . perhaps this is not the author's fault . after all , writing a calculus text is no small feat . the authors of these books have to try to include every possible concept for fear that a math department or instructor will reject the book because it omits something or other . this means that you will get a little bit of everything , with a paltry few examples for each section . if you have a sadistic professor aren not they all ? you may feel lost in trying to grasp calculus concepts from this book texts are full of assumptions , often skipping steps along the way in the examples . packed with lots of thus and therefores , this book will be a mystery to all but the few geeks who were members of the math or star trek club in high school . definitely buy the solutions manual , as well as rea's problem solver , schaum's outlines , and 3000 solved proble ms good luck ; you are going to need it .
1			it	heavy	bike	real	we	disappointed	size	nice	bike	new	size	small			adorable but way too heavy and , no , there are no breaks . we bought this bike for our son a year ago , for his third birthday . i liked that it was a nice small size and the look was gender neutral and gorgeous . however , we have been very disappointed with the bike's performance . it is just so heavy . my son has a really hard time getting going on it and going uphill just doesn not seem to work for him on this bike . one mistake that i won not make again is trying to surprise him with the bike and not trying it out ahead of time in the store . we will soon buy him a new bike and this time will take him to a real bike shop to be fitted and to try out the bike .
2			drummer	great	rhythms	usual no	album	new	lp	original			forgotten classic . i have a treasured copy of the original rough trade lp , and as the years pass this album sounds more and more like a classic . they had a pure pop heart , but were not afraid to try unusual rhythms and melodies . the balance between grant's ballads and robert's spikier tunes brings to mind lennon and mccartney . this is probably still my favourite of all their albu ms stand outs are cattle and cane , and that way . and now they are back together , and a new album is coming definitely answered prayers . no lindy morrison though ? now there was a great drummer .
2			movie	great	price	right	white	black	movie	classic	movie	good	performance	great			a really good movie . this is a classic , great movie . it's one that is watchable on a repeat basis . low key but very meaningful . the movie is in black and white but that actually seems to add to it in the same way that the bogart movies casablanca and 'sahara effectively use that price is right . it's a keeper . buy it and sit back and enjoy a great performance .
1			bookstore	local			i felt cheated . i waited so long for this book to be released . called the local christian bookstore on the day of its release october 20 even wrote it on my calendar ! did something i never do paid full price . brought it home , opened it , and almost fell over . i had paid nearly $ 27 for a book that had 4 inch margins , and was isn not a full length book and to charge that amount for such a padded effort is , well , sinful ! like the other reviewers , i love mitford , but i don not love such chicanery . shame on you , jan !
1			book	next			disappointing . wow ! i have read most of patterson's books , including the alex cross group . this is the only one that thoroughly disappointed me . the plot was all over the place and the ending . . well for the most part , there wasn not one . confusing and sad . sure hope the next book saves this dismal story . i have not talked to anyone who enjoyed this book . everyone is allowed one mistake . mr patterson , i hope this is yours .
1			book	funny	character	main	supply	short			too absurd . i thought this book would be funny , like bridget jones , but it wasn not . since it's a spy novel , i hoped for some suspense , but this too was in short supply . then there appeared to be some sort of romantic interest for the main character too bad there wasn not any chemistry . what a yawn .
1			disappointment	huge			disappointing ! i believe it has already been said , but this book was a huge disappointment , especially in the ending . i was left in a state of shock and disbelief at the ending .
1			errors	constant	i	surprised	friend	best			editing or conversion errors ! i liked the story but could not concentrate because of the constant grammatical errors ! almost every time the word close or closed was supposed to have been used it appeared as dose or dosed . there was a lack of punctuation so sentences ran on and recipes included misspelled words such as portobfxo instead of portobello . most glaring was goldy's best friend being named maria rather than marla as she is called in the other books in the series . i found these errors very irritating and was surprised that no other reader commented on them . my other kindle books did not have nearly this amount of errors . clearly there is a need for better proofreading in the conversion process !
1			anything	useless	range	useful	twins	old			piece of junk . i m the father of 5 year old twins . using my wife's login to write this . thought this would be a fun thing for them while they are out running around the yard , or driving their battery powered jeeps . problem is , these things have a useful range of about 10 feet . no kidding . move beyond that and the static builds so quickly you can not hear anything are useless . if it didn not cost so much to send em back , i would return em , but i will just write off the $ 14.99 .
1			i	glad	book	boring			disappointing . i agree with most of the reviewers . this book was boring and not vintage kathleen . i was glad i didn not buy the book and borrowed it from the library . the flame & the flower still remains as 1 !
2			performances	great	story	great	i	hooked	screen	big	film	little	films	great	profile	high			the little film that could . why is it that indie films never get a chance at the big screen . sometimes i wonder about hollywood and why they do not put out great films like dirty girl . i came across this film by mistake and read up on it viewed the trailer and was hooked . i purchased it and was blown away . the story was great it had several high profile actors which in some cases kills a film but this it did not . jeremy dozier and juno temple do an amazing job giving great performances . i highly recommend this movie . it's a keeper .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			waste of money . i suffer from mild acne and i have brown spots . i used this product for approximately 2 weeks . it burns and it did nothing for my skin .
1			film	predictable	characters	flat	question	real	machine	tremendous	acting	mediocre	questions	good			escaping the matrix . this movie bites off a bit more than it can chew . it wants to pose the question what is really real ? it also wants to make us think about the meaning of our lives a point overlooked by almost all reviewers . are we just cogs in a tremendous impersonal machine that is the world ? are we no more than fuel that sustains civilization ? what is this civilization ? and who is it for ? of course , these are all good questions . too bad the characters in this movie are flat and the acting is mediocre . i felt no sympathy for any characters in this contrived and predictable film . and i felt relieved when it was all over .
2			music	great	albums	best			great patriotic music . one of the best patriotic albums that i have hea rd it has the straight beautiful versions of the songs as written without the added wavering voice or jazzed up versions .
2			buy	good	stereo	little			good buy . i bought this as a christmas gift for my mom and she really liked it . she wanted a little stereo for her room and so far she has had a great time with it . she liked it so much that now she wants to get one for my dad's garage .
2			book	good			she has done it again ! ! oh my , oh my , she has done it the ones that have ms feehan's other books you need no intduction , to her fine the ones that don not know about her dark series . this is a good book to get to know about ms feehan work . nicotetta and giovanni story is so powerful , that you don not want this book to end , only love and magic could keep them at each other side . a keeper . .4 stars
1			premise	great	seem	realistic no			disappointment after blj . this books pales in comparison to his blue like jazz . while a cross country road trip is a great premise for a book this one just falls flat . the conversations seem wooden and not terribly realistic for two would udes traveling together . the 3 d character , their ancient vw van which breaks down at frequent intervals , should have been given a name to add some texture and imagination at lea st i think the fact that they had to travel mostly on interstates and had very little time to actually linger in the towns and backwaters they encountered meant that at best you have a few meaningful encounters but largely time is spent just trying to cover mileage fast and cheap . average read and i have already put it in the goodwill box .
1			product	worth no			broken ext . arms on both my portamate's . i own 2 portamate 7000 and was attracted to the cool power strip incorporated into the stand . on both of them the extension arms have broke . on both sides ! also there is alot of play or flex in the flip up stops which makes them inaccurate . this product is not worth the money .
1			word	new	and	boring	feel	clean			i felt my body dying . when the first credits began to roll at the end of this torturously long & boring movie , i fled the theatre , arms spread wide , eyes ablaze , looking for something , anything , to get my mind off of the last 100 minutes . i wanted to bathe in bleach , or perhaps gouge my eyes out just to feel clean again .40 minutes into lost in translation which , by the way , is a new code word amongst friends , meaning get me out of here ! i could actually feel my body dying ! i would have collapsed on the theatre floor if the movie had gone on much longer . no , seriously , most scenes went on for minutes minutes ! too long , and were boring in both their content and meaning when it came to the paper thin storyline and simplistic character development . i want both my money & my 100 minutes back ! unfortunately , i m forced to give this movie at least one star . there's not an option for zero .
2			budget	low	movies	old	it	amazing	helping	good			no budget , plenty laughs ! it's amazing what you can do nowadays with no money but a good helping of talent . this low budget double feature embraces the cheesy wondefulness of old b movies and produces two wacky , goofy comedies that had me laughing throughout . plus the whole family can watch !
2			range	good	it	good	ladies	classic	bargain	great	album	great	range	dynamic			a blues favourite that really benefits from the re mastering . my wife and i really loved this album when it first came out just about wore out the vinyl on repeated saturday night playings . it was then a very early cd purchase and according to the wb version we had it had been re mastered but it did not quite sound right a bit thin and also muddy in parts . this time it has been re mastered well good dynamic range that does it justice . this is early bonnie and it is good and bluesy and her voice has a tone and quality that draws on the classic older blues ladies . a great album and now a great audio bargain .
1			songs	boring	album	bad	opinion	personal	songs	wrong	guys	wrong			whats wrong with you guys . i was fan of thalia since she came out but i gotta say that this album is bad im sorry you guys but come on , its boring , superborin since the day i bought it i have listened just once and i had enough , the songs are boring . all of them sound the same , she thought that stefano was gonna help her to have the same hits as paulina did . sorry but she and him picked the wrong songs . ps is my personal opinion . thalia had her fifteen minutes of fame already .
1			catalogue	old	songs	great	reviews	great	wings	ok	fan	huge	days	young			don not you just get enough . although i m a huge mccartney fan , owning all his wings and solo works until flowers , i beg to differ from these great reviews . i mean don not you just get fed up of all these live concert albums digging back the same old catalogue from the beatles and wings days ? this album already contains 20 beatles tracks out of the total 35 ! wings over america was ok , being historic in itself and contains a lot of great wings songs . it captured the spirit of wings in its 70 heydays . then mccartney decided he was getting old and needs to re live his young days . that's when i really got irritated ! unplugged , tripping , paul is live and this ! don not we get enough of this ?
2			i	satisfied	mixer	sweet			stanton . this mixer is pretty sweet and i was satisfied with it except i have a ton of drag in the fader already , even though the focus fader is guaranteed to never have drag . i have only had it a few months now .
1			patches	huge	support	useless			it just won not work . this game simply will not run on my machine . i more than meet the recomended system requirements , and i have tried just about everything i could find that might help . it still won not work . three huge patches have been release for the game . but even with the patches the game still won not run anything more than the menu and the tutorial . i have given up on getting this game to run . ea support was useless . all they did was say that you had to meet the min . system req . and update your drivers which i did . i gave the game 3 stars on fun level because i won not put down a game i can not play . it gets a 1 overall though because it simply won not work . ea support gets -1 for being useless and making me sit for several hours to download and install over 5 gigs of patch info only to crush my hope when the game still wouldn not work .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			don not waist your money . so full of mistakes . where ever she got the patterns she did not translate them well . totally ripped off dot matthews . bought rights to her pattern and didn not even write it correctly .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the 5 love languages . order received in time and condition specified by the seller . would definitely consider buying again from this seller !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			spend a bit more elsewhere . i got these because they were fashionable . that was two years ago . i only had these for about 3 months . i never wore them daily . i would wear them while biking , and i took them to camp with me . then after i picked them up , the screw holding the arms to the lenses was coming out . i ignored it , and soon enough , there went the arm , and the glasses fell off my face and cracked the other arm . so i taped the arm back on , and taped the other arm on the crack to prevent it from falling apart . but , it did . bottom line don not try it . i have had many , many cheap sunglasses over the years , and its always the same problem . the arm hinge ans screw . if only it could be reinforced by metal or something . not wire frame glasses , which btw , last a bit longer .
2			one	previous	it	fun	sieve	thin			nicely designed spin knob . you would think that a salad spinner is a salad spinner , but number there are differences . the inner sieve can be thin and break easily . and then there's the issue of the spin knob itself . my previous one had a knob that was downright clumsy to use . this one is very course , the way we used to spin salad dry was to put it in a french collapsing wire basket and step on the balcony and wave it about , daringly , allowing centrifugal force to hold in the romaine and drive out the wash water . you looked daft for two minutes and the cat got wet , but it was fun . unless it was raining . this is better .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			boring ! whoever said there is no such thing as a grumpy ukulele player hasn not seen this one . the instructor looks and sounds like a mathematics professor . his lecture is on music theory and how to read music . he could really be talking about almost any stringed instrument . give this one a miss .
2			guidance	constant			i still read this every day . the book of mormon is something you really have to read for yourself . for me , it is something that gives me constant guidance and comfort everyday . approaching with the mentality of what does this teach me about jesus christ is something i think would solve many of the problems in the world today .
2			seemed	clear	trials	emotional			belljar 1 . read a library copy of bell jar and had to have it . it felt like i was side by side with her , all the way down . it seemed so clear what she was saying , it was spooky . now i can re read the book and notate on every page . books i really like i must write in . feels like i know her . i always want to understand , or try to , the mental and emotional trials of struggling , highly intelligent individuals . bell jar is on the list , and not overwhelming . on the way to infinite je st
1			gift	vocal	talent	true	schoolish	high	song	bad	television	bad			god help us with this dreck ! this single is beyond tacky . semi celebrities from a bad reality television show attempting to cash in on the war factor . not a winning formula to earn any grammy nominations ! this single is explotive in nature as revenue generated from sales go to fox television & their production house 19 ent . unfortunately , the public will be subjected to listening to this bunch of up with people candidate flunkies invade our airwaves with a bad over the top cover of a lackluster 1980 s country song . this torturous single makes one dream of being trapped in a basement in nothern iraq listening to a loop of celine dion performing my heart will go on . unfortunately , the only true talent in this group is vocalist rueben studder & he has very limited solo time on this project . the arrangements make it impossible for him to showcase his vocal gift . i suggest to wait to purchase his solo project instead of this single from a team of high schoolish wanna bees !
2			blend	great	dad	old			a great blend of comedy and drama . i just love this movie . you won not be disappointed . its both funny and well written i liked it so much i bought a copy for my 70 year old dad to watch .
2			story	good			interesting tale of some of the most embarrassing corruption in boston . good story . easy read . lots of relevant detail and explanation of the situation of the corrupt politicians , criminals , and policing forces in and around ma . not sure if everything is factual , but a good read .
2			nicholas	usual no	nicholas	original	overtones	social			nostalgia for innocence ! this is a moving journey . stimulating and disturbing film with social overtones . since two white australian children are stranded in the outback , they are forced to negotiate across the desert . in those harsh conditions , they decide adopt an aborigen who will guide . the images through the desert are after lawrence of arabia , of course of first rate . the enrichness dialogue and the relation between all the members of this forced expedition are handled with talent and eficiency . this film and do not look now may be the most artistic movies of that unusual , potent and original director nicholas roeg . a timeless cult movie !
2			itself	intriguing			kindle sample version . the book itself is very intriguing , written by an amazing edition handles the umlaut better than the other versions ; however , struggles with greek letters . could it be a kindle issue ?
2			i	surprised	dynamics	social	school	high			well written teen movie . when i first heard about this movie , it would be a fun movie , but mediocare . i was pleasantly surprised about it the caracters were really well rounded with fun quirks that remind us of the cruelity of the social dynamics of high school and the movie was well written with hilarious and witty lines that fit into the context of the story that fit the caracters and went a step beyond the conventional lines . it was a well done modernazation of taiming of the shrew .
2			character	good	read	good	novel	good			red lily . i rate the third book in nora robert's garden trilogy as a 4 star very good romance novel . it has the momentum that good character and tense plot bring to a good read so that i didn not want to put the book down until i finished reading it . i found the denouement a bit weak at the end the story seemed to stop in its tracks and that's they only reason i didn not give it five stars .
2			album	nice			a smooth madonna album . fresh from the criticism of the sexually charged erotica album , madonna tones it down just a notch and gives her music a heavily r&b influenced album . i consider this madonna's smooth album , something nice to sit back and relax to .
1			history	enjoyable			boring . i tred to enjoy this novel . in fact i battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel . the history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but i applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey .
1			fan	disappointed	songs	good			disappointed gnr fan . i was let down by this albulm . i have liked all the gnr albulms but this one has been played the lea st there a couple good songs but it is not one i can pop in a listen to all the way through . if you are collecting all their work i would put this towards the bottm of the li st
2			condition	great			excellent service . it arrived on time and in great condition . there's nothing more to say , i received excellent service .
2			cup	empty	character	main	interview	worth	detail	small no			funny , explosive novel about atlanta in mid 90 . this is a hilarious , beautiful book . not a page goes by where there isn not some small , perfect detail that captures a bright facet of life . reading this novel is like coming out of a movie theater in mid afternoon it wakes you up to all that you have been missing the way a nearly empty coffee cup looks late in the morning , the way the ghosts of your parents haunt you , the way you can not grow up and always have chapter in particular where the main character goes for an interview at a rock magazine is alone worth the price of the book . there's just so much completely smart stuff in here about the marketing insanity of the olympics , about the look of 20 somethings in the mid -90 , about the meaninglessness of the names of rock bands . an addictively good read .
1			book	good			i agree with the other reviewers not a good book for sure . due to inaccurate information in this book , i agree with some of the other book reviewers that this book is on unstable ground . why buy a book about home inspections if you have to get other books to find out the correct information ? after reading this book i too found that many topics discussed were inaccurate and therefore unreliable . i too regret purchasing the book .
1			i	sorry	welfare	right	welfare	general	democrats	new			ribtickling . you gotta love libertarians . i am sorry if you and mr boortz feel that schools , libraries , environmental protection , public health etc are not areas in which government should involve boortz , heinous new deal democrats didn not create this the preamble to the constitution , the supreme authority from which all libertarian philosphy is derived , the wellspring , the mother lode , the alpha and omega promote the general welfare is right there in black and white . enjoy your feudalism .
2			i	disappointed	quality	poor	mathis	best	features	special	concert	great	features	great			such a great concert , but . this is truly a wonderful concert , and johnny mathis is at his best ! the special features are great and include a tour of his la home . however , the quality of the video is poor . we originally saw this concert on pbs , and it was much sharper and of higher quality . not sure why this is the case , but for that , i m disappointed . the four stars are for johnny himself well , he gets five , but the video quality takes away a star .
2			quality	good	remake	solid			solid remake and br transfer solid . item arrived well packaged , on time and as described in the item description . good quality and can easily recommend to others .
1			waste	total	it	terrible	toy	terrible	toy	crap			this toy is crap . this toy is terrible . bad sculpt , and it leans over soooo far , it looks like it's going to fall ! it's terrible ! a total waste of money , don not buy it !
2			talent	new			hope to see more from this new talent ! wen spencer gives each character such life ! you feel as though you have met each one as they are introduced . even minor charaters , like the bike mechanic , live and breath instead of being simple cardboard cut outs or stereotypes . i spent two nights of almost no sleep , 1 1 2 hours or so , reading this action is none stop , the plot twists unexpected , and the love between the characters perfectly understood . bravo !
2			book	best	characters	believable			the best christmas book ever ! i don not know how many years i have read this book faithfully in december , both to my family and my school children . it is a profound story of love and joy and acceptance , written simply with honest , believable characters . once you have read this story , your heart , and christmas , will never be the same .
2			problems	major			emc 8 postive results . among the vast sea of media software programs emc 8 is my favorite . i did not face any major problems with any other software program , but they weren not as well organized as emc 8 i didn not struggle with different cd and dvd disk formats . this program has the steps arranged in a logical order and you don not need to be a tech guru use it .
1			card	fine			hair puller . windows sees card fine but drivers wont install have surfed the internet trying to find drivers that work waste of money and to expensive to ship back no more amazon for where do i cancel .
2			songs	great	dvd	good	it	good	success	huge	it	hot	you	glad	videos	outstanding			this dvd is so good i had to throw a party ! i have this dvd cd and it is so good that i had to have a dvd bash to showcase it ! it's so hot it sizzles ! the dvd has ten outstanding videos and the cd has 20 great songs . the dvd party was a huge success ! buy yours now and throw your own party . you will be glad you did !
2			stories	true			human endurance and survival against extreme conditions . if you like this book , and survival by your own wits stories in general , check out two amazing books which are true stories . the long walk and adrift . edge of your seat amazing stories about human endurance , wits , and surviving when up against extreme danger and elements .
2			world	spiritual	evolution	spiritual	find	nice	depiction	great			yep . there was a tear . this movie was a nice find . it even pulled a tear or two out of me by the end . it is a great depiction of a spiritual world the spiritual evolution of individuals .
1			things	nice	reviews	good	movie	close			someone shoulda put this turkey to death . i can not believe that there are so many good reviews of this movie on amazon . this movie absolutely stunk . you knew exactly what was going on 20 minutes into it . i kept watching , hoping that there would be some twist that would save it . but there wasn not . believe me folks , this movie is pretty darn close to being as bad as the postman or the patriot . i ordinarily don not write reviews , but the reviewers so far must be related to the filmmakers or paid to say nice things or something . this movie is an insult to intelligent movie goers . fair warning .
2			i	new	afterall	bad no	problems	terrible	thing	good			it's one you won not forget ! i m new on the block . first review . i used to manage a b & n , but not anymore . so now it's amazon . anyway . i must admit that i couldn not put night down . to be specific , i read this book in 2 sittings . 5 to 10 is the norm for me i couldn not wait to see what wiesel was going to share next . i also couldn not wait for the punishment to be over . having just discussed night with a friend over coffee , we both agreed that one good thing about this book , is that it will cause most of us to see that what we feel are terrible , dreadful problems , might not be that bad afterall . the book may just put things in proper perspective . it did for me , on !
1			things	good	intentions	good	hippie	big			lame ! never forget that this guy was in csny ! ! he has done a few good things like rust never sleeps but he also has a history that everybody seems to have forgotten . indeed , some people seem to forget that actually in the 70 s and 80 s neil young was equated by some of us as the hippie . and he has managed to deliver one big hippie so there is some dostortion on the the album is based on good intentions but the sweet harmonies . really it is too much . ok greendale was maybe worse but does that really mean anything . i mean i like some of his stuff , i really do but here he is stretching my patience quite a bit .
1			one	wide no	cobys	disappointed	square	small	look	fine	camera	regular	pictures	regular			i have to resize every picture ! i have a regular format camera , not a wide screen one . i could not find a way of setting display size in a way regular pictures look fine and fit well in this widescreen i had to crop and resize the pictures before putting them into the frame . otherwise pictures show as a small square in the middle of the manual says that you can update devices's firmaware but there is no such update in the support section of cobys web disappointed .
2			bookstore	local	presidents	recent	book	good			well written and researched . i picked it up last weekend at my local bookstore , and i began by reading the juicy parts . i enjoyed reading the most recent about the most recent presidents , but i found i liked even more the comments on some of the lesser known guys . a good summer beach book or airplane read .
2			jamma	bad			beauty n z beast . eve seems to be your average around the way girl . but upon further acquaintance you see she is a multi dimensional lady that has witnessed alot of heartbreak in her lifetime . she plays down her beauty so that you wonder about her feminity but she thrives off of her quick wits and inner beauty instead of her outside shell . k wan brings along alot of interesting characters for the trip . welcome to the gangsta lifestyle that only k wan could develop as he brings us our hood legends with spice . eve is definitely in a class of her own . she's a bad mamma jamma and she ain not scared to use that hammer !
2			parker	interesting	hero	interesting	movies	big			not very amazing . sure doc oc was done very well and the scene where spidey stops the subway train was a thrill ride , but once again the slow , peter parker scenes just dragged the action to a screeching halt far too many times . i get that a superhero action movie needs to establish the humanity of the character , but does he have to be such a dull dimwit ? as far as best superhero movie ever goes , i will still stick with the first superman and batman movies and perhaps even daredevil . when not in costume , the hero needs to avoid being pathetic or at least be interesting and amusing enough to overcome that state . in his first two big budget movies , peter parker has been neither interesting nor amusing while being far too pathetic to engender any sympathy . better luck next time .
2			part	big	plot	believable	kid	young	leagues	big	read	easy	murder	great			a home run . troy soos has started a wonderful series with this first installment of the mickey rawlings mysteries . the combination of the early 1900 time period , the freshness of a young kid new to the big leagues , and a murder intertwined with baseball is great . it is an easy and quick read . the setting plays a big part of the appeal of this mystery novel which soos masterfully creates . the mystery / plot is believable and does keep the reader in suspense . i eagerly await each installment of this series . soos writing seems to get progressively better .
2			harrelson	great			decent caper movie . two retired theives match wits with an fbi agent who for some odd reason doesn not believe they have given up includes deleted scenes , bloopers , commentary with director brett ratner , interview with a jewel thief featurette , and more . woody harrelson is great in this film and along with the rest of the cast you will rarely experience a dull moment .
1			job	poor			poor job . i got all four discovery hd dvd's . brazil and china work fine on my toshibaa -2 italy and australia do not . i returned them to amazon and the replacements did not work either . then i started reading and found many otherpeople with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with thesetwo disc's . these two will go back tomorrow . it's a shame discovery did sucha poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering howfew different models of hd dvd players there are out on the market .
1			professionalism	total			one star too much . having enjoyed tremendously the first three seasons , the fourth would have been better left alone . i m sorry i bought this fourth season , as it really makes you yearn even more for the earlier three seasons . the lack of jeff's presence is made painfully clear by the bumbling , well meaning but totally ineffective newcomer who shouldn not even try to fill jeff's shoes . the total professionalism that jeff showed by withdrawing from the series is soo very understandable ! the series would have become a cult classic if it had ended after the third season ! no one remembers the series that faded out . this show deserved soooo much better than to become a cheap copy ! of the unwatchable us series friends .
1			movie	hate	quality	great	ending	stupid	ending	predictable	movie	horrible			worst movie . i bought this movie , great blu ray quality . movie is horrible . not for kids at all . story of a psycho kid , runs away . meets some psycho creatures . the whole time u r praying that it ends with a moral . stupid predictable ending . kid runs back home , and smiles at mom . yeah yeah , i know . but still , hated the movie . i sold it to some co worker for 10 bucks . i know there is a following to the book and people love this movie . movie still stinks . dont buy it . trust me .
1			angles	positive			ok at the price . poorly designed casing affects the quality of the device the lcd panel has better viewing from positive vertical angles , literally flipping the thing over greatly improves its viewability when placed on a horizontal surface with the included stand , but this requires all the jpeg files to be rotated by 180 degres . otherwise its an ok device at the price .
1			account	biblical no	behavior	negative	fiction	complete	books	interesting	accounts	historical	it	disappointing	faith	positive	background	historical			complete fiction , not a biblical account . although the book was an interesting read , it was very disappointing . it was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the jewish / christian faith . i will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible , but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying . there was no respect given to the god of abraham and that i have to say was the most disappointing part . there are way better books that are interesting to read , give an accurate historical background , and hold true to the integrity of the word of god .
2			album	great	trio	great			one great power trio . glenn hughes sings and plays great . so does the rest of the if ever there was someone who could have been the replacement for bon scott it would have been glenn album proves it unequivocally . great album from start to i say great power trio ! if you are an ac dc fan don not work is done now .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			very unhappy . this is junk . i can see why you did not give measurements . i have a 5 in . vise , i can not do anythingwith is for a mini vise . your co . should be ashamed to sell something like this .
1			glow	good	escape	great			the great escape . my cat seems to be able to work his way out of any collar that doesn not have a buckle and this one was no exception . within half an hour , i had put it back on him four times . i would imagine that the glow in the dark feature would be good for cats who go outside , but , since mine doesn not , that wasn not a plus for me . even if he were an outdoor cat , the glow in the dark part wouldn not help if he constantly shed the collar . would i buy this collar again ? number
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the deadline . who is queens of the stone age ? 1 person ? i think this album is the deadline of homme , i hope it . horrible .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			great . the product was just as described . the cd got here when it was supposed to . very pleased with this item .
1			hole	black	score	classic	score	great			for fans only . aliens from the third planet of the black hole or something like that hatch a plot to transform tokyo into some kind of alien super city with the aid of a giant robot and a living dinosaur . naturally , only godzilla can save the day . i loved these movies when i was a kid and i still want to love them now for their nostalgia value , but i just can not get past how clunky , repetitive , and , they are . nevertheless , i give this film a couple stars because i can still get a thrill from the iconic image of godzilla stomping through tokyo , the classic score is great , and there are a few moments of goofy charm that deliver the experience i was hoping for . /
2			it	wonderful	enchilada	easy	taste	great			even my teenagers enjoy the food from this book ! i bought this cook book after reading a review in the newspaper . it is wonderful ! using convenience foods from the grocery store you can fix dinners in 30 minutes that taste great . one of our favorites is easy enchilada's . my college age son requests it when he's home this from a mom who is not known for her cooking ! also try the bean burritos . i have given out 10 of these books to friends , family and teachers !
2			voice	nice	man	young	release	current			what did you expect ? nice sounding cd as a whole . finally , not a mention of bling bling on a current release . while many i am certain were hoping for a virtual replay of all of their favorite clay songs sung during the american idol competition , this set showcases what a nice voice this young man has . sure , there is a tinge of predictability here . then again , what did you expect ? sit back and enjoy it .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			didnt work for me . started with just 1 capsule per day , tried for 5 days . all 5 days been having diarrhea . like not even funny . stomach would make loud noises too . i m still giving a try to every other day , so will see

2			album	terrific	albums	best	it	original			original . this cd just blew my mind . i had never heard an album this good in awhile . i must of heared it a hundred times . this system album is terrific . this was really the first time i heard them . i do not regret getting this cd . it is different and original . sarj is a mezmerizing artist along with the other guys who hypnotize you with there very last song . let it take you on a trip . system of a down rocks ! one of the best albums ! !
2			it	large	product	great	we	happy	it	warm	material	traditional	hit	huge	m	large			keeping warm . this was a huge hit in our house for christmas . the blanket is 100 polyester , which i was expecting more a traditional sweatshirt material . it is still very soft and large and warm . the m on the blanket is large and yellow , sewn on to the blanket out of the same type of material jerseys are made from . overall a great product that we are quite happy with .
1			product	tiny			read carefully ! 12 ounce not 12 cup . the moment i opened the box i realized my error . this is a 12 ounce not a 12 cup replacement beaker . totally my failure to read carefully . it's a $ 5.00 mistake you don not want to make . this tiny product does seem to offer the 5 star bodum quality .
1			versions	original			doesn not live up to the title . leaves out a lot of her hits , but does include the original versions of it's my party , you don not own me , that's the way boys are , look of love , california nights , and maybe i know . the rest is awful filler material that should never have made it onto a cd with this title .
2			drivers	new	i	happy	them	fine			seems to work fine . i just received this item a couple of hours ago , but so far it seems to work just fine . i only have memory stick and smartmedia media so i can not vouch for the other media types , but the adapter was able to read them just fine . my windows 2000 laptop didn not require any new drivers and the adapter doesn not come with any . having one card to read both media i use will be very convenient and it costs basically the same as a single media type adapter . the only tradeoff is that my smartmedia only adapter comes with an eject button and the 4 in 1 doesn not you have to eject the adapter to be able to remove the media , but given the different form factor media it accepts , an eject button would probably have been a minor miracle of engineering . as long as this adapter keeps working like it does now , i m happy with it .
1			it	annoying			don not waste your money . rubber handle grips will first accumulate water and later they will start comming off . it's so annoying that you will have to throw them away . at the end the hindge will brake and you will regret that you have spent your dollars on it .
1			woman	outstanding	i	happy no			ida wells woman of courage . i was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman , but i was very unhappy with the product . dull . two other items included on the video , but the part about wells consisted of a person reading from a book . get the book biography instead of this product a waste of money .
1			actress	bad	actin	good			sad ending . i have only the vhs , and i must say the end ruined this movie , which was following so tight , well crafted and with good actin although i think mastrantonio ia a very bad actress . anyway , i will seek a dvd edition for myself , to understand what the reviewers below are talking about . to say this movie is better than terminator judgement day is a kind of heresy , but , well , who knows .
1			song	new	pink	suck	disc	new	hit	big	work	horrible	girls	stupid	core	hard	song	catchy	cd	horrible			i wish there was a lower ranking . pink sucks . this is a horrible cd and horrible albunm art work . they gave her too much freedom on this cd since mizzunderstood was a big hit . that is probably why her new song stupid girls is so catchy and sing songy it makes me want to puke as well . but i guarantee they didnt let this wanna be riot grrrl go all hard core again . if they did , this new disc is bound to wind up in the .99 bin along with try this .
2			romantic	classical			wonderful ! this is a wonderful set of volumes that has just about every piece of music ever written from haydn and vivaldi to ravel and copland ! i like it because it is so wonderful becuase you don not have to search around from the sheet music , you can just look in the index and find the piece that you are looking for and the just play away ! a wonderful set that teachers can use for teaching the music of every period like baroque , classical , romantic , and 20 h century music ! this is also a wonderful set for aspiring music educators !
1			information	new			cyril wecht name the only reason this book is selling . the only reason this book is selling is because of the cyril wecht name . there was no new information in the book . all the stated information was already published in other publications . disapppointed to read something already your $ 5.00 !
2			crime	true	events	true	drama	great	story	true	film	great	novel	original	bust	biggest	part	complete			true crime . this box set includes the french connection i & ii . the original is of course the most well known of the two . the movie is based off the true events of the biggest heroin bust in story follows two of nypd's narcotics detectives as they stumble onto a hunch which turns into a huge multi jurisdictional case . detective doyle who is played by gene hackman , was one of the nypd's most decorated officers when he retired . the two detectives build their case and eventually narrow their search of suspects before finally getting the approval of the upper brass to make an arre st this is a great crime drama which follows the original novel and the true story really ii of the set picks up where part i ends . what most people don not know is that part ii did not actually happen . part ii is complete fiction while part i is a true story . great film !
1			riffs	central	they	annoying			yeeeccchhh ! i have been a donny osmond fan for many years and the osmond christmas cd is one of my favorites , but i think this cd is one of the worst i have ever heard ! i find the arrangements awful and not even close to the brilliance of those written by the arrangers that he and his family have worked with in the pa st and i think donny should face the fact that he's from utah and not from a south central la cliched gospel riffs just don not make it in my fact they are terribly annoying ! get real and be yourself !
2			shoes	great			great shoes for commuting to work . i bought my first pair a year ago for a week long tour of dc . i have been wearing them almost daily to work since then and finally bought a second pair , not because the first wore out , but just to have another color to go with light colored slacks .
1			business	worst	student	experienced no	book	small	lessons	big			worst business book ever even when i got it as a gift . i m so embarrassed my friend gave me this book as a gift as i get ready to launch my own company that i want to return his money . this book is written like a term paper by an inexperienced student who leveraged the harvard name . it was a worthless waste of my time to even scan it . instead i would recommend the book by the founder of subway start small , finish big 15 key lessons to start and run your own successful business by fred deluca , john hayes .
2			thing	little			another ra gem ! for those of you that read my review for from one , pretty much what i said in that review is a repeat . this is an excellent cd , though toned down from one , it still rocks . you can not go wrong with ordering both at the same time that's what i did . btw , i think ra does every little thing she does is magic better than police originally did it ! !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			experience the magic of aladdin ! this story is about a group of kids who find a lamp . but after rubbing it things start changing ! amazing things happen ! i highly recommend this book for you not just to read , but to experience the magic ! i also think that it brings out the imagination in a kid . especially a kid who is just starting to read chapter books . when i was just starting to read chapter books , i would always wanted to read the bailey school kids books . now i can not stop !
2			source	great	stick	affordable	book	easy	item	legal			newer isn not necessarily better . written originally in 1976 it still is one of the very best in self instruction of the 6 foot 1 1 4 stick . cold steel sells a very affordable 4 foot wax wood stick called a yon shaku bo that is a perfect selection , and is a completely legal item to carry hiking , traveling , in your car . the book is very easy to follow , comprehensive and a great source to get the fundamentals of kobu do bo jitsa katas .

2			i	late	covers	great	photography	great	it	nice	covers	wide	values	recent	asset	great	colector	major	name	real	book	great			finally ! a monkees collectible book ! i am late on reviewing this book but had to comment . i love this book . very goog work and research ! great photography ! it's so nice to see someone put this much effort in a monkees collectible book . my only complaint is the records are not valued correctly . we need a monkees record collecting guide . if not for values , just to see the great world wide covers of the albums , single and ep's that differ from country to country . marty eck is that his real name ? bought most of the items in this book . since most of us could never afford such a collection or find some of these gems , this is a great coffee table book . again with putting values on collectibles , any kinds , is a matter of supply and me , ebay is where i usually can find recent values . being a monkees record collector , i am thinking of joining forces with a major colector in the uk to create the book i always wanted . this book is a great asset to anyone's monkees collection ! buy it !
1			baby	good no			an boring okey satire . this is almost perfect but for a couple of dreadful scenes especially the ending it's quite not that good baby . so if you want a nosensible movie see shakesphere in love .
1			book	good	books	good	they	nice no	blake	easy no	it	difficult	descriptions	graphic	strangers	complete			i m not sure i like anita blake anymore . i am not a prude by any means and i love a good book . the first books in this series were good books although anita blake was not always very easy to like . the last couple of books are nothing more than a most unlikable character having sex with anything that moves , and somethings that don not move ! in one day she had sex every two hours and with complete strangers . and the descriptions are so graphic , they just are not nice to read . they just go on and on and on . enough already ! i enjoy the other characters , however it is difficult to read when she is just plain mean to the people who love her .
2			price	normal			awesome . this is awesome exactly what was advertised and got it for 20 dollars normal price is 60 dollars this is great thank you .
2			brother	big	ideas	new			thinking book review written by muad would ib . this is a really wierd book . in the beginning it starts out like any country in a war , but later it delves deeper . the world being controlled by three super powers that if you read to goldstein's book would supposedly , and i agree , would gain absolutly nothing from all this . the are simply trying to use excess junk . anyways , orwell did an amazing job on this book , creating several radically new ideas for the time , including creating newspeak , big brother which was the basis for the show big brother , and , the worst , thoughtcrime . anyways , this is definately not a childs book , so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world . it makes you think of the present , and the future . if you like orwell's books you will love animal farm .
2			products	old			don t go to the cosmetic counter without me . this book will save you a lot of money . i tossed out a lot of the old products i had purchased that were rated not good to use . i think anyone will find the product reviews useful , regard of the age of the person .
2			singing	incredible	album	good	delirium	great			very nice . delirium are great and this album is very good . i loved karma and i agree with the reviewer that said that karma was an exploration of shadow energies and that poem seems to be more heaven like . that sums it up in a nutshell . poem is a very heavenly set of track sang by heavenly voices . the singing on this cd is incredible and during some tracks i had goosebumps . while you listening to it i felt expanded and uplifted . it is a cd that speaks to the heart chakra . i really enjoyed it .
1			dress	great			jen . i ordered according to my size . the dress fit great except for the chest area was extremely to big and there was no way to alter the dress without ruining the style . couldn not exchange for smaller size as the rest of the dress fit great .
2			one	best	movie	popular	book	great	stories	great	book	fun			great book . we were very well entertained by this book . since , it is now a popular movie , the book is even more fun to experience . tolkien has provided us with many great stories . this one is right up there with the best of them .
2			books	best	book	powerful			poignant , thought provoking , and hilarious ! joseph heller's , catch 22 is without fail one of the best books ever written . if vh 1 did an award's show for books this one would win in damn i wish i wrote that . this is a powerful book that can alter your reality !
2			album	solid			the sword have made a masterpiece ! this album is by far one of the mist solid , riff filled collections to cone out in the last 20 years ! i already had the cd , sounds even better on vinyl and awesome gatefold picture inside !
2			book	usual no	it	new			the book of future describing the reality . when i first read dune in russian i thought it was a very unusual book . but when i managed to get it in english it was absolutely new . i thought by the title and the setting that it will be a simple description of the future as i judged by the dune film , but it was the description of our reality , the demonstration of the things that might happen and do happen nowadays in arabic countries where religion influences too much the thoughts of people .
1			fit	bad	luck	nice			baggy . bad fit for an ordinary guy . i can not imagine who they design such shirts for ! i had luck with one of their traveler shirts really nice , and attempted to get another twice no more !
2			comprehension	real	event	major	knowledge	detailed	book	wrong	deal	great			an excellent read . i had pre conceived ideas about this book which turned out to be completely wrong . this is a wonderfully crafted story which got better and better as it unfolded . when nathan takes his wife and four daughters to the congo in the late 1950 to undertake missionary work , they have no real comprehension of what is in store for them . there are some obvious obstacles that confront them and many that they cannot have envisioned . after a major event occurs which should not be revealed until the reader reaches that stage of the book , their family structure and future drastically changes and for me this heralded the most fascinating part of the book . a great deal of cross analysis with the bible can be made , but don not let that deter you . even without a detailed knowledge of the bible , the reader can still thoroughly enjoy this book and gain a great deal from it . having enjoyed the poisonwood bible so much , i will go on to barbara kingsolver's other works without hesitation .
1			it	good no	side	wrong	school	high			not that much of a heartache . when evie brand comes home from l . a . an ex model running from a stalker she seems to get on the wrong side of wade armstrong , someone who's been in love with her since high school , someone who's help she needs and wants even though she does not want to admit it . this is the second book in the all girl brands series it 's not as good , it does not hold you all the way through it only picks a little at the end and you can not feel a whole lot of empathy for the heroine is just self centred and boring and you can not see what the hero see's in her besides the fact she is a model the hero deserved better .
2			album	best	drumming	incredible	lyrics	disturbing	cover	fantastic	boys	best	lyrics	compelling	banging	constant			relentless ! slayer's best album in my opinion , though most will say reign in blood . rick rubin really has wrung the best out of the boys on this one . dave's drumming is incredible and driving , the guitars are searing , and the lyrics are disturbing and compelling . this will leave your neck sore from the constant banging ! the cover of judas priest's dissident aggressor is fantastic and spill the blood is a great closer . this is a must have for any metal fan and will quickly find its way to your most played stack .
2			i	wrong	he	funny			better than expected ! i had seen this dvd when i was visiting some family out of town . i would have never even thought of looking at eddie griffin standup before because i didn not think that he would be funny . i was wrong , funny dvd !
1			i	useless	waste	complete			not what i ordered . i was trying to buy blank checks but only got a few pages of blank checks . what i apparently paid for was a cd rom which i didn not need and was completely useless to me . i feel that what was promised and what i got was completely different . this was a complete waste of money .
1			book	nice	cookies	hard	cookies	dry			nice book , awful recipes . i didn not want to give these as gifts before trying out the recipes . the first one i tried made cookies that were about as dry and as hard as rocks . the second recipe made cookies that came out like pancakes that i had to scrape off the pan and throw out . i wasn not interested in wasting more time on any others . i modified one of my own favorite recipes to fit in a jar .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			enlightening , to say the least . learning from a nazi concentration camp survivor on how to find purpose and joy in the midst of pure and absolute hell on earth was enlightening , to say the book has everything to do with purpose and willpower . purpose and willpower go hand in hand . the ability to constrain your options for something greater than this moment comes from having a meaningful purpose .
1			me	sorry	parrafin	hot			made me sorry to have the gift of sight . i had to read this for a book club , and a fifth of the way into it , i began to wish i were blind , so i wouldn not have to continue . i considered gouging my eyes out with a grapefruit spoon . and if someone tried to read aloud it to me , i was prepared to pour hot parrafin into my ears . and if anne sullivan tried to sign moll flanders into my hand , i would dig into my wrists and sever the nerves to my hand with a carpet knife . then if someone tried to tap the text of this book onto my back using morse code , i would be left with no course of action other than suicide . as it was , i completed my book club obligation , and as soon as we are done discussing this , i m going to bandsaw open my cranium , locate the part of the brain that remembers i read this book , and scoop it out with a melonballer . wish me luck !
1			cameo	nice	looks	familiar			to boldly go where noone wants to . i can not even begin to describe how disappointing this will always be my favorite st and to have it end on this note is truly sad . finally breaking the tradition of even numbered movies being better the responsibility of this disaster lies squarely on the shoulders of the director . they might as well have gotten john woo after all if you are going to destroy a franchise why not get someone with experience ie . mission impossible ii the cast is still the strongest of the st franchises and is the only reason this isn not getting a one star review . there's also a nice cameo by janeway . pity they couldn not come up with a better script than this . worst of all the deja vu ending circa wrath of khan leaves even the non st fans thinking hmm this looks strangely familiar i have every st tng dvd but i think i m going to pretend that this didn not happen . only slightly better than must be turning in his grave .
2			night	next			life can wait you wont be able to put this book down . this was a read of a lifetime . i have recently been introduced to tim winton's author style by seeing the movie of his novel in the winter darkness . absolutely stunning . we were given a copy of the book at the film premiere . i went with colleagues from work most of us had read the book by the next night . the riders is a stunning story and holds you in its grasp from the first para . i thoroughly recommend this book to anyone who wants to relax and travel in their mind to another place and another time . you will be looking for your luggage on the last page .
1			food	real			mediterrranean diet should be about real food ! the cover is information should containe recipes about real food ! not man made sweetners . i would not recommend this book to anyone wanting to eat clean .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not as good as american psycho , but good . like i said its not as good as american psycho , but its pretty good . some songs you might get bored off easily , but that happens all the time with other cd's as well . if you are the kind of person who expects glenn danzig kind of stuff , don not buy this cause you won not get it !
2			rapper	great	fan	biggest	c	great	music	great	something	new			devin the dude's biggest fan ! ! ! devin is a great rapper but who is very underrated . i have all of his c . d . even though he dosent get allot a play down here in jacksonville fla . waitin to exhale is a great and funny c . d . i would recommened it to any one who loves devin or is looking for something new or who just wants to know who the dude it . even though in magazines it says this is devins best cd yet i think that the other 3 were better . to the xtremm , just tryin to liv and the dude are off the chain . i would just recommened everybody to get the devin the dude c . d . he makes u laugh , and also it great music to smoke to !
1			review	bad	it	best	pissing	potential	transformation	complete			disgusted . you people are a band is going to disappear for 3 years , and then decide to return with something 95 different from what they have even done in the past , i would rather they just disappear for good . i won not get into a long , winded review , or a potential pissing match with another reviewer , but i will say that city by the light divided is a complete transformation from full collapse , war all the time and even waiting . when i can safely compare thursday to u 2 or radiohead , it's probably for the best that i forget they even hey , that's just my two cents . i m sure all the sheep , er , i mean fans who liked thrice's vehissu will be all over a city by the light divided . can not call it maturing , thursday were already there . can not call it progress , cuz it's not . 'selling out ? maybe . i never thought i would write a bad review for a thursday reco rd
2			me	proud	floridian	native			florida's history , told in a completly entertaining fasion . this book made me proud to be a native floridian . it sometimes made me be ahamed as well . i was shocked at the quality of the content and of the writing style . i thougt i was reading michener . it will become a treasured part of my library .
2			i	glad	it	good	lesson	good	idea	wrong	i	old	movie	good			better then i expected . even though i am 30 years old i still enjoy a good teen movie sometimes . i had avoided this movie since it came out because i got the wrong idea about it . i m glad i watched it last night because it was good , and really taught a good lesson without feeling like an after school special .
1			one	new			failed in less than 60 days . this unit came with streets & trips 2009 and failed in less than 60 days . pharos is replacing it with a new one under warranty but will only give a 30 day warranty on the replacement gps . the original had a 1 year warranty . proceed with caution .
1			it	hate	book	boring	book	interesting no			not interesting at all . i wish if i just could get my money back , the book is not interesting and boring ! ! hate it
1			disapointment	major			death to smoochy . robin williams fans , stay home . this film was a major disapointment and is the second movie in 40 years we walked out of . the kids might like it but mr de vito did not deliver on this one . save your money .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the worse pda . i bought this item not working within one month . i sent it back for repair , just two days not working again and then sent it back for repair , again two days dead again . waste my shipping fee , don not put your money to the garbage can as me .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			home alone family fun edition . the movie gets 5 stars the picture isn not crisp enough for my taste i don not think they remastered it nor does it say anything about it on the box . i will keep it because there is know replace at this time except blu ray and that might have same concerns .
1			techniques	elementary	reference	good	reference	little	services	expensive no			worth the price , but not much information . this appears to be a good little reference for getting vendor links as to where to purchase inexpensive promotion related web services for the do it yourself er . my reading is that the author has tried many of these services , and offers some tips on which ones are is not much of a book though , as its 100 pages can easily be compacted to 50 since the publisher uses double and triple line spacing . it's not an introduction for the beginner because it's too skimpy . a beginner is probably best served by first reading other books about promotions and then gathering tips from this book on how to cut costs . the techniques presented are accurate and elementary .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			disappointed . the overall quality of this item fell short by a long shot when compared to the price paid for it .
1			it	sick			yet another person profiting on laci & the baby's death . i just think it is sick , all of the people including amber frey who are jumping at the chance to profit off of a tragic death of two innocents . i am sure that laci's parents were offered book deals too , but they actually knew and loved laci and would not put out a book like this . sick people .
1			maria	cool	singer	good			i enjoyed one song . maria maria is cool . the restyou can find in file 13 heis like some singers who isa one good song singer .
1			they	right	hamsters	poor			defective . i purchased one of these and it does not work ! poor hamsters almost died . pushed my finger against the ball no water came out did it repetedly still no water . had to squeeze it to make the ball damp . guess they are right it does not drip but it doesn not allow the hamsters any water either . put a super shallow bowl with a bit of water for now until i can find a working replacement .
2			decadence	visual			a future cult classic ! man suspects wife of cheating on him . man bumps in to creepy guy at party . man kills wife , but can not remember it . man transforms into another man . if this sounds baffling , be warned it's only half the plot ! fans of david lynch will love it , as will anybody who enjoys film noir , kinky sex , mystifying mystery or visual and aural decadence .
1			it	worth	premise	good			for god's sake , get on with it ! i absolutely loved the first few books in the series . then i started to get tired of waiting for some of the story lines to continue . the characters , after all , are so complex and have so much going on . so i got one book , then another , then another and finally realized that jordan is milking this for all it's worth ! he's never going to resolve anything because he's making too much money stretching it out , and stretching it out , and stretching it out . could we have a little more action instead of pages and pages of bland , totally unnecessary descriptions and feelings , please ? this is finally it for me . i will not buy another book of his in this series . i will miss the characters , but it won not be nearly as bad as having to read through 100 pages of drivel per scene ! hey robert good premise , but you are losing it !
2			movie	great			loved it . it's a great movie . it has become my favorite movie . i would recommend this movie to everyone that i know
2			characters	good	movie	great	movie	good			a team fan gets given the last 10 minutes . what is it with some directors and editors ? this had the makings of a great movie . action , comedy , decent story and good characters . then with 10 minutes of the movie remaining , the director & producer went home and left the rest up to a fan of the a team . both characters out in the open , 50000 bullets , outnumbered 20 -1 and . well , i really do not want to spoil the ending for you i mean , come on ! a 12 year old could have written a better finish . however , forgetting the ending for a moment , this was a good movie and i do recommend it .
2			skills	outstanding	film	special	performer	remarkable	actor	dramatic no	it	worth	concept	great			movie sincerely yours . this lovely movie showcases liberace beautifully ; however he is not a dramatic actor . the story was a great concept , but fell short . liberace tried to present the best he could with it ; however , just seeing liberace and his outstanding piano skills made the film very special . for me , it was worth buying and seeing a remarkable and stunning performer we can never forget !
1			it	terrible	protagonist	real	fiction	historical	plot	terrible			i read the same book as everyone else ? what on earth did everyone else read ? book isn not even worth 0.1 of a star . it's terrible ! i m pretty sure 20 mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel . i m not really a fan of historical fiction , but it was given to me as a present so i felt i had to read it . the plot is terrible . none of the characters have any depth or any real protagonist , if you can call him that ; nicolas , only has one trick up his sleeve to plough his girls . a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure . he then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12 there's a bit of talk here and there about i think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book . the story is complete nonsense and very poorly expressed and to be honest with you , i cannot believe it ever got published , let alone sold and read .
1			replacement	new	camera	new			8 b memory card . card was malfunctional from the beginning . i bought a new camera at the same time and thought the problem was the camera and so returned it onlt to realize that it was the card when i got a new camera replacement
2			it	boring			i should have read it before . i was supposed to read this book in my freshman year of school 1968 . since the teacher required it , i figured it was boring and didn not read it . before the movie titanic which i haven not seen , i read the book no greater love by danielle steel about a family on the titanic , it peaked my interest so i read this book . boy do i wish i had read it when i was supposed to ! i read it from cover to cover without putting it down and then gave it to the rest of my family . it sure would have brought my grade up .
1			book	worst			bless her heart for writing this . this book is the worst ! it is more like a journal than advice on how to deal with a child with sid . no reference is made as to what works and what doesn not . mrs wilson uses this as a forum to slam her son's teachers and class mates . she even refers to a 2 d grader as the son of satan nice and very christian of appears that mrs wilson thinks she's doing something benefical for others but don not waste your money here . if you are looking for a book to help you cope with your child's sid this is not it .
1			music	soft	i	sorry	danger	serious	video	funny	fins	superior	video	final	track	new	segements	ridiculous	video	boring			don not watse your money on this pointless single . i love liars , but they are in serious danger of becoming laughably arch and out of touch . i m sorry , but i don not like paying . for a single featuring one of the last album's weakest tracks , an unitelligible live cover , and a new track that is nothing but soft background music . the videos didn not help much either . the video for we fenced other gardens with the bones of our own is unintetionally funny . it does have a few creepy images that show potential , but ridiculous segements , like a choreographed dance with brooms , ruin the mood . the sex boy video is a fairly amusing collage of images , but it can be found on their website . the final video is just as boring as the pos song it is set the album or the far superior fins to make us more fishlike ep instead .
2			opinions	strong	correctness	political	series	entire	plot	predictable			i had to read them all . usually i have strong opinions on what i read . but in this case i had to read many of the one star reviews of this book to help me determine what was bothering me . i agree with much of what is said in the one star reviews too much political correctness , predictable plot , cardboard , as i sit here writing this review i must admit i have read the entire series . that's why i had to give it a four star rating . something kept me coming back . maybe it has to do with my age . i was a child during wwii . there is something about the idea of going back in time with the technology of today . there is also something about how , after all these years , we have not changed enough . we still carry all our hates , fears and biases . guess you will have to see for yourself .
2			cd	best no			this is history . this is not just the best cd out , it is one of the best in history sold out everywhere nobody can find it 50 cent is the future ahhhhhhh omg i cant believe this cd cop it now
2			dream	new	structure	political			an intelligent approach to china . i have read this book on my way back from china . this book explores the changes affecting china and the chinese people as a whole . cleverly written , it describes the period that encompassed the change in political structure of china from a communist country to a market economy country . the stories of the chinese people included serves well in explaining the chinese mentality as the quest for the new chinese dream , money getting rich began . interesting read for all those who plan to travel to china or deal with chinese people .
2			one	great	readers	young	book	good			a very good book . this book , written with the style of a newspaper reporter , is a great one , chronicaling the struggle to reveal the truth about the nixon administration . the only flaw was that the authors seem to assume the reader already knows many of the minor characters from experiencing the watergate scandal as a citizen . for this reason , this book can be challenging for young readers .
1			rca	expensive no			very disappointing . unfortunately , this product is nothing more than audio techica's way of getting rid of a very cheap turntable by packaging it with hard to use software and an inexpensive rca add on cable and calling the whole mess an lp to digital recording system . ha ! unlike other turntables which are usb ready this one is not and requires plugging into a sound ca rd . which may or may not work . i was looking forward to enjoying this product but , within minutes of setting it up and tinkering with it , it was evident that this was going to be turntable is made of very cheap lightweight plastic . the only positive i will give it is that it has one heck of a sturdy dust cover . avoid this .
2			one	good	it	easy	books	true no	book	good			this was an awesome book . harry potter and the sorcerers stone was a very good book . iam not usually in to books that are not true , but this book is a good one . it is very easy to read and i recomend it to anyone at any age .
2			college	big	insight	great	depth	tremendous no			very insightful look at big time college football today . as an 'sc alum and avid football fan , this was easy reading brain candy . not tremendous depth , but the book gave me great insight into how players are recruited and how the coaches approach each game . john mckay's autobiography is much more thorough about the game and leading the team . conquest is a recap of the last several seasons with some behind the scenes stuff thrown in .
2			bands	new	cd	amazing			rejects ? speak for urself ! this cd is simply amazing , being the punk fan that i am i look for new bands to listen to , i heard there swing , swing song , then went out and bought the cd . if you like rock , alternative , or whatever your taste is , this cd will satisfy it . this is a must own ! period .
1			movie	good	i	disappointed			lame . boring movie , not very good acting and slow moving . overall not entertaining . i was hoping for a feel good chic movie but i was disappointed .
2			product	great	design	good	usage	comparable			great product . i went to kmart thinking they have this thing in stock like it said it has , and found myself ordering on amazon for this thing . i think it is range is a bit more limited that i like . essentially , a smoke upstair could not reach the downstairs where this is installed , as well as the upstairs smoke alarm . so , it is comparable usage , and who would have guessed it ? anyhow , since it didn not need a battery to screw on , i decided to have this thing move later on , but does come with a holder for a lamp bulb and works with the environmental friendly type . overall , there's a insert with a pin placed in so if i leave it off , it comes on at a scheduled beeping and doesn not do much good since there's no smoke , so i guess that really could be something to improved upon . anyhow , it is a good design just could do with a little more finer tuning and adjustment .
2			construction	high			well built . extremely solid high quality construction , easy to assemble and install . fits a 2003 land rover discovery and , if positioned correctly , you will be able to open the rear sun roof . does not include the lock cylinders , but does include the end caps for the load bars .
2			love	complete			sublime liminality . the lovely ironic lyrics and quiet catchy tunes make this my favourite album of the moment . was introduced to wilco by a friend and balked at fir st now am in complete love with this band that's not quite country and not quite anything else . i m always in love and via chicago are marvelous , and she's a jar always leaves me half smiling but mostly shocked . amazing stuff .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not pleather . pleather is fake leather want i got was a plush basketballeaster basket ! that was from target with the price cut off the tag ! i have never had a problem with an amazon item until now . i would nothave purchased if i would had known this .
2			noise	real	noise	comfortable	sound	good	noise	great			great sound , comfortable and real noise cancelers . i have purchased a lot of headphones along the way , but this technics had make everything correct . i have been using this every day and not in the smooth way and the are still like new . if you want good sound and durability , buy this item !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			journey rocks again . an absolute corker of a cd . when youre alone is an absolute stunner . this cd is journey at their best and although many people have never heard of journey let alone their music , after listening to this cd it will convert even the most die ha rd
1			storyline	entire	idea	great	character	strong	character	central	premise	basic	things	ridiculous	storyline	predictable			failed attempt at female empowerment . the basic premise for this book seems like a great idea for historical or pre historical ? fiction . however , it failed to deliver . the entire storyline was so predictable and hackneyed i had to force myself to finish the book . the characters are all one dimensional and stiff and auel never really succeeds in bringing them to life . and come on , who really didn not see the ending or the rape scene coming ? auel was obviously trying to create a novel centered around a strong central female character , but she just succeeded in making ayla looking like an untouchable annoying kid with all the answers . also , the neanderthal mind meld is one of the most ridiculous things i have ever read . the only reason i give it two stars is because i like the fact that it has a prehistoric setting .
2			film	little	you	happy			just enjoy it please ! this is one of the most delightful movies , and it preserves the flavor of burns & allen . since we have so little film of vaudeville , this movie shows us what we missed . the wiskbroom routine surely came from the stage , and the dialogue between gracie and george and fred surely came from the stage . come on folks . don not compare this film with ginger and fred . its not supposed to be like top hat . i personally like damsel more than swing time which doesn not feature enough dancing in the first hour . sure joan fontaine is lost but she's only 19 ! look where she went from here . get the movie , pop the corn and relax . this is a feel good , just dang fun movie , and you will be happy you saw it .
1			thing	worst	headphones	good			fragile , they broke real soon . i bought these headphones for $ 60 , i thought the deal wasnt that good but i wanted good quality headphones , they sound good not great though , and the worst thing is that they broke within a week or so , cheap plastic , so i would go with another brand like sony or pioneer
2			effects	special	effect	special	result	usual no	environment	creative	it	like	book	great			great book ! having grown up with star wars , this story of the early years of ilm offer inspiration and behind the scenes look at what it was like to create special effect in an most unusual , result driven , and creative environment . and not to mention how the bar was raised on special effects from then onwa rd
2			quality	comparable	fashion	negative	dvd	best	fan	big	mark	high			not enough stars to do this justice ! easily the best concert dvd ever produced imho . i can not understand how any music fan / audio / videophile could speak out on this title in a negative fashion . the engineering behind this dvd sets a high mark for others to meet in the future . if you only buy one music dvd , this is the one to have . do yourself a favor and invest in a quality dts player , amp and speakers to fully enjoy this work of art ! and i m not even a big eagles fan ! can not wait til there's a clapton dvd of comparable quality !
1			one	new			won not make coffee . we have owned a farberware coffee pot for 40 years and have always bought a new one after many good years of service . just bought a new one and guess won not make coffee , just some brown water . evidently when they started making it in china , quality went away . will never use farberware coffee pot or any farberware again . i suggest you look around for something else .
1			book	disappointing	detail	technical	you	happy no	knowledge	basic			this dummies book really is only for staying dumb . i found this book really did not provide much technical detail at all and was very disappointing . if you have even a basic knowledge of simple home electronics then you , like me , may be really unhappy with this . of course , the title says it's for dummies so i guess i should have payed attention to the warning , but instead i wasted my money .
1			merit	literary			questionable content for teens . this book was required reading for my teen . although the book may have literary merit i found references to bestiality , torture and gore inappropriate for a required book .
2			events	historical	book	fascinating	discussion	great			great reading group discussion book . i didn not know anything , really , about the plague until i read year of wonders by geraldine brooks . i certainly didn not think i wanted to . but i enjoy learning about things , especially historical events , different places and different times . this book is fascinating . it made for a great book discussion for our reading group .
1			flavor	great	hersheys	new	version	new	version	new no	cocoa	special	hershey	old			an awful update . i don not know if the change was finances driven isn not it almost always or simply product development trying to justify their existence , but hershey's new version of dutch processed cocoa is new but not remotely improved . the old hershey's dutch cocoa was a top notch product for those on a budget great flavor , no harsh or bitter flavors , no interruption of texture . this cocoa guts most of that success with its strange twang cocoa may taste earthy , but not dirty and powdery texture . for goodness sake hershey , take a page from coke and just say no to new hersheys special dark cocoa .
1			issues	scary	seem	safe no	paint	cheap	quality	low	it	safe no			please don not give this to your children . we bought this set because our boy likes farm receiving them , we opened the box and it stinks from chemical off gassing . the paint they use is cheap , and several brush not ouch ups have been done to paint does not seem safe , and i would never trust this product to be non hazardous for my kid to put in his mouth . that is not going to be a possibility to worry about , because these are going straight to the trash . be chemical stink also stays on your hands after handling them . disgusting . besides the scary chemical issues , this set is ugly . the molds are very low quality . the paint bleeds into the contrasting colours , and the animals don not stand up on their conclude , i would feel like an immoral person to donate this toy . it belongs in a land fill , and should never have been made . please don not buy them . i am contacting the consumer product safety commission about this product , as i believe it is unsafe .
2			thing	great	spices	new	suggestions	great			great for any cook or cook wanna be . most people are a bit timid about trying new spices or blends in their cooking . the great thing about this book is that it gives you not only the directions to make your own blend thus saving you lots of money ! but suggestions on how and when to use them . this is a must have for the timid cook to those that experiment with their own blends ! it gives great suggestions and has a wonderful variety .
2			lines	classic	restoration	great	you	young	system	old	movies	classic	period	civil	look	informative	history	good	extras	interesting			this movie hasn not gone away . if you like classic movies , even if you are too young to have seen it growing up , this one is right up there on the i should have is my 2 d copy ; first was a vcr which wore out . great restoration ; classic lines ; frankly , my dear , i really don not give a damn . shocking in the 1930 s ! with some good history of the civil war period . {artisic license allowed}all the characters have something to offer , and the behind the scenes extras are an interesting and informative look into the old hollywood system of is a definite to add to any collection .
2			films	usual no	filming	beautiful	acting	superb			quality filmaking . i really enjoyed this video ! i disagree strongly with the reviewer who said nothing worked in it . the acting was superb , and the filming was beautiful and haunting . many images from the film have stuck with me watching it was like visiting another world . my only complaint is that i didn not completely understand the ending ; it felt a bit unfinished . but it is well made and a very thought provoking movie . i recommend it to anyone who likes films that are a bit unusual and are driven more by character than by fast action .
2			bonus	nice	buildings	extra	daughter	grand	value	great	he	old	assembly	easy			great value for the money . easy assembly . far more extra buildings and accessories than we expected . a nice bonus . our 4 yo grand daughter loved this gift and plays with it constantly . how it hold up over time , only time will tell . we are hoping it makes it to be used by her baby brother when he is old enough .
2			book	fabulous			amazing ! if you enjoy lord of the rings or the hobbit an unexpected journey you need to read this fabulous book !
2			work	great	version	original			a monumental opera performance ! it was a revelation to see and hear this great work . like many others on this page though , what i really seek is the original film version with sidney poitier , dorothy dandridge and sammy davis jnr . are you able to help ? so many have asked will there be any responsive action ?
1			statesa	united	cd	good	fi	low	thing	suck	song	great	lyrics	stupid	b	big no			terrible . there have only been a few cd's that i have thought about asking for my money back and this is one . yeah devils and dust is a great song , a really great song but that is where anything good about this album ends . the only other b . s . heh thats funny album i have owned is born in the the united statesa . so i admit i m not a big b . s . fan but man , this thing sucks ! the lyrics are stupid and to cover this he mumbles his way though them but it doesn not help . the music is dull low fi crap . my advice is listen to some samples , download the single of devils and dust and use the $ 15 you saved to buy a good cd . i m sure b . s . has some better ones .
2			bowl	large	bowl	perfect	bowl	tough			perfect size ! this bowl is perfect for smaller recipes . the only trouble i had is that after one hand washing , the bottom of the inside of the bowl developed tarnish spots that smelled like ru st i returned it for a replacement that came 2 days later ! and have not had that issue again . other reviewers mentioned that the bowl was tough to dislodge from the base without a handle , but i have not had that problem the hardest time i have had getting a bowl off the base was getting the large bowl with the handle after using the dough hook .
2			case	nice			one of the best . this pc drill / driver got plenty of power . excellent handling . nice case . very happy overall .
1			wit	weak	writer	good no			dull , derivative , unimaginative . well , you can not please everyone . i decided to try this book because of its phenomenal success and popularity . i can now say that i have read it and i found it a dull affair . rowling is not a good writer . the book is episodic and the narrative doesn not really move along . while everyone else praises the book for its display of imagination , i didn not find one novel idea or incident in it . the wit was weak , the characters one dimensional , the plot uninteresting . rowling has taken fictional bits and pieces from dozens of other children's books and whipped up a stew out of them which lacks originality and force . more grievously , there is an emptiness behind it all . a book for very , very easily entertained and not very literate children .
2			movie	great	look	realistic			great firefighter movie . ladder 49 is a realistic look into the lives of fiirefighters . i m a firefighter and i have to say this movie is no joke . from the minute we get in our truck our lives and are in danger . just get the movie .
2			end	loose			the funniest book i have ever read . i have read this masterpiece many times since it was published and , each time , i laugh out loud as if i were reading it for the first time . the characters are sterling , the plotting flawless and the writing witty . from its first description of ignatius waiting for his momma outside the d . h . holmes store to its conclusion every loose end tied into as thick a braid as ms minkoff's hair this book is a priceless treasure .
1			stories	boring			disappointed . i saw this book listed on a bunch of people's funniest books i have ever read lists . i didn not enjoy it at all . the stories were boring and uneventful . i only finished it because i felt obligated after spending $ 10 on it for my kindle .
1			installment	next	storyline	entire	book	horrible	enjoyment	great			not worth the wait . i can not believe that it took three years and nearly 700 pages to write this book . the entire storyline of this installment can be summed up into two words nothing happened . i have every book in the wheel of time series and have read them multiple times with great enjoyment . but this last book is just horrible . you keep reading the book waiting and hoping for something to happen and nothing ever the prologue , the wolf is introduced into the story line then never heard from again . are we to wait three more years to find out what his attack plan against the seachan is and wether or not it will work ? it is almost as if robert jordan doesn not know how to end the series and is writing this book to waste time . i recommend that anyone who has not purchased this book wait for the next installment and start from there . you won not miss a beat . severely dissapointed in mr jordan .
2			play	enjoyable	expansion	great			voyager ccg . voyager , another great expansion into the star trek genre and also in the ccg game . it is even better for the treekies out there for they have multiple affliation personnel . such as older maquis and others that show up on a federation and then again on a non affiliated ca rd makes game play more enjoyable . also with the edition of some ultra rare cards like the prometheus , this expansion set is all the more worthwhile for any ccg trekkie .
2			daughter	old	i	glad	accessory	nice	model	particular	it	effective no	it	nice	blankets	extra	concept	great	baby	warm	one	little			keeps baby warm without all the blankets . the bundle me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months . it attaches very easily to the carseat , and i can leave all the extra blankets at home except for a light one . this particular model is wind and rain resistant , which is nice for keeping my little one dry . it's a great concept ; kudos to whomever invented it ! i do have 2 complaints though . first , it's not as effective for younger babies . my daughter is just 7 weeks old , and i don not zip up all the way . this keeps the fabric out of her face . i will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the bundle me is a bit more snug around her . secondly , the zippers aren not as smooth as i would like them to be . they occasionally catch the fabric on the inside , so zipping up is sometimes more work , and always when i m in a hurry ! but overall , i m glad i bought this . it's nice having a barrier against the wind , rain and cold with just one item .
1			books	serial	notice	black	me	wrong			keeps getting darker . black notice is the beginning of the dark period for patricia cornwell . don not get me wrong , i love serial killer books , but her books keep getting darker and darker depressing to read .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			not worth it ! nice , well made product , but super heavy . haven not used them but can not imagine using them for anything but serving . handles are actually the lip of the bowls . not bowls you would grab for everyday uses like mixing or storing things .
1			song	good	lover	sexual	you	tired no	song	best			la chica mojada is back with one good song . this is paulina rubio's first english if we can call it album . it includes eleven songs in english and five in spanish . at first i thought that paulina's english was better , until i heard this album . i could not understand what she said . and even worse , the lyrics were not even included . in this album , weed actually means with . anyway , the songs in this album are not impressing . have you heard si tu te vas the spanish version of don not say goodbye ? well , if you have , that's the best song you will hear out of this album . i will be right here sexual lover , fire sexy dance , the last goodbye , and not that kind of girl , are all songs of her past spanish album which paulina rubio renewed in english with different sounds . i wouldn not reccommend this album . just download si tu te vas if you are still not tired of hearing it .
1			size	reasonable			not impressed . because this book was a reasonable size i expected bigger reproductions . most of the prints are a mere 3 5 . if i live in the states i would have sent the book back .
1			purchase	bad			bad purchase . i only received on respone stating he didn not have the item i purchased but he could still get it . 1 month later i still haven not received the item purchased and requested my money back . will never use this site again .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			plano 771 . this box has a lot of room . i use it to store a game i have called descent . i really like it .
2			revolution	spiritual	girl	young	it	worth			stephen king , revisited . i have been an avid reader of stephen king's works for quite some time , reading everything of his i could get my hands on . i stopped about 4 years ago , however , when it seemed that everything he wrote sounded alike . i bought the girl who . on a whim ; it was on clearance at a book store , and when i read it , i fell into it . there was no stopping until i finished it . i could almost hear the buzzing of the mosquitoes . i recommend this book to absolutely anyone . i think this was a very exploratory novel for king and he did a wonderful job of incorporating a simple lost in the woods tale with a spiritual revolution for one young girl and many readers , i m , there is no gore , it won not haunt you at night , but it is worth reading , every wo rd you will laugh , you will cry , you will wish for more , so you will read it again .
2			problem	real	horror	great	frankenstein	original	lesser	classic			wolf man . the wolf man is one of the lesser of the great universal horror classic but still a classic . it is about a werewolf who doesn not want to be one . the only real problem with the movie is a lack of motivation . we know that you don not want to be a werewolf . if you want to see a better movie see the original frankenstein but still don not miss the wolf man ! ps does anyone remember the ending ? i forgot it and it's really bugging me .
2			dvd	wonderful	sales	good no	show	great	dvd	great			great show , great dvd . mama's family is a wonderful show , and the dvd of the first season is wonderful . i hope wb releases all the seasons of mama's family on dvd ! as for all the complaints i see on , the dvd's shows are edited . however let's keep in mind that edited shows are better than no shows at all . and everyone who has canceled their order has hurt the chances of seeing a dvd of the second season . every mama's family fan should order season one . if you want to see an unedited season two then let wb know , but don not cancel the order ! if sales are not good there will be no season two , three , , my how we hurt ourselves trying to prove a point ! i encourage everyone to purchase this dvd set . it is a wonderful show even during the first and second seasons . in fact my favorite episode of all time is in the first season mama gets a job . what a laugh ! !
2			look	good			funny . this movie was how i remembered it . funny story and man the actresses look good dressed up . good for the family
2			you	new	guys	good	setting	rich	experience	alive	guys	bad			hero vs norway . hammond innes wrote this shortly after the war and the characters are all carrying some aspect of their wartime pasts with them . ostensibly a quest to find the man who knows where there are valuable thorite deposits in norway , the hammond innes reader knows they are in for some very rich scene setting . this book covers in depth sailing including in bad and icy conditions , a whaling station ie slaughterhouse , and an icy trail on foot and skis across norwegian mountains . each is described with the eye of one who has lived it , and that is the primary treat in every hammond innes book . he went there , he lived it , he flensed , he gybed , he trekked . the story is a standard one with bad guys and good guys and a pretty girl , but the characters are deeply enough drawn to make the experience vivid and alive . if you see it , buy it . if you are new to hammond innes , then dive in and enjoy .
1			songs	catchy	bands	worst	thing	bad	religion	bad	talent	real	school	high			again ? please number . not another they have enough money and time to stop ruining the music industry ? i guess not . anyways , again we get one hundred percent pure crap from one of the worst bands in history . for all you kiddies who disagree , shut up because you really dont know anything , unless you can at least say one bad thing about this album , because then i see you are not as ignorant as you are precived to be . i happen to be in high school as probably many of the kids are that reviewed this , i am a sophmore , and i also happen to stay as far away from music like this as possible . you fans of this say its punk and the songs are catchy and help you . you obviously havent heard much . bad religion , rise against , strung out , nofx , and descendents are all catchy punk bands with real talent . please do yourself and everyone else a favor and spend your money on the bands that deserve it , not simple plan .
2			book	enjoyable	i	new	book	huge	read	good	it	worth	way	good	ideas	good			interesting food but very sweet . this is a different kind of cookbook in my opinion , in a good way . i love reading jamie's comments , he writes just like he sounds on tv which makes the book very enjoyable . i often read it before i go to bed . i didnt actually want this cookbook , but i got it last year as a x mas gift and i am gald . some of the recipes are ummm different , that is why when i saw it for the first time i didnt buy it . i think that is me though , i am still new to cooking and i dont think i could pull some of these recipes off . with that said after i actually took time to read it there are penty of recipes i plan on trying . it is a huge book and it took me some time to thumb through . as a newbie to cooking there are lots of good meal ideas and ones to aspire to . it is worth the money just for a good read
2			fan	die	picture	amazing	audio	bad	fan	hard	price	reasonable	cons	slow	electronics	local			amazing picture reasonable price . i looked and looked at my local electronics stores comparing every lcd tv they had and when i saw this one it was a wow moment . the picture on this is amazing to say the lea st i have a buddy who is a die hard sony fan . he saw this and couldn not stop talking about it . cons are video switching is slow . no hdmi . and audio is bad . . but who cares about audio . if you are going to be spending the money that this costs i would bet that you have a surround sound system already .
2			anyone	interested	copy	hard	copy	old	england	interested	teenager	young			always a favorite and will be yours as well . i read this book as a young teenager , about 17 years ago and have re read it many times . i recommend it for anyone who loves the post henry the viii period in england or anyone who is interested in reincarnation and fiction at it's be st i recommend this book highly and wish that it wasn out of print my old hard cover copy fell apart years ago and i haven not been able to find it anywhere else . enjoy !
1			tracksfrom	enjoyable	treasure	little			never get the chance to let me down again . not able to tell from the packaging i regretfullypurchased this pricey deluxe edition only to findthe last four songs have been removed from the ending with pleasure little treasure makes thewhole nostalgic vaunt all vapid and 2 contains the catchier more enjoyable tracksfrom the singles along with what i call the missingtracks although some would argue . alas they can onlybe played on a dvd player not a car stereo . kind of aworthless novelty albeit deliberate .
2			i	wrong	lens	perfect	bit	little	aperture	constant	thing	little	lens	close	thing	amazing	i	worried			man just buy it ! forget the plastic mount , the plastic construction , the fact that it's not usm , etc . this little thing is amazing ! ! i own the tamron 17 -50 m f 2.8 and even though i like the focal length of that lens and also the fact that it has a constant f 2.8 aperture , i always find myself increasing the sharpness of my photos a little bit in post processing . with the canon 50 m 1.8 i don not have to do that . this thing is razon sharp and for $ 100 dollars , you can not beat that . i was a little worried before i bought it about the focal lenght . i thought because of the cropped sensor in my canon t 2 , the lens was going to be too close to use in close quarters , or that i would have to stand 50 feet away from my subject , etc . boy i was wrong , this lens is just perfect . get it , you won not be dissappointed ! !
2			book	best	plot	good	book	good			best book ever . this is the best book ever . it has awesome characters and a wicked good plot . its a good book that will just keep getting better till the end . i cant wait for the second book and the movie to come out .
1			movie	stupid	movie	worst	you	crazy	heresy	scientific			most stupid movie . the day after tomorrow is one of the worst movie in decades ! there is nothing making any sense in this crap movie ! don not waste money on the movie or book . it makes you crazy on thestupid pseudo scientific heresy .
1			story	japanese	development	terrible	transalation	bad	story	boring	authors	japanese	it	unbelievable	story	old			boring and maudlin . maybe it was a bad transalation . maybe i could not relate as a westerner to an old japanese story , but i really did not enjoy this book . it was maudlin and unbelievable . story was boring . character development was terrible and it was poorly written / transalated . i recommend murakami's norwegian wood for those who want to read books by japanese authors .
2			band	old	rock	electric			the birth of rock ! before chuck berry and elvis and everyon . want to hear the birth of electric guitar rock , then buy this cd . the guitar sounds like it came from a scuzzy 16 year old in the neighborhood punk band . but it in fact was recorded half a decade ago , before your parents were even born ! you may not realize , it but ike turner isssssss the father of rock !
1			beds	good			these beds are only good for a few months . we would bought one for our cabin . in six months , used less than 10 times . popped whilewe were laying on it . no we are not fat . very poor quality and abysmal customerservice ! wenzel would not replace nor refund . absolutely useless ! beware !
2			stuff	good			no promises , but an interesting book . granted i have labeled myself amongst the dating impaired for awhile before i picked up this book . i decided to review this book about 6 months after i have been through it and see where my life is . as far as dating goes , i will say it has improved . i m not sure whether it is the content of this book or just my life in general . anyways , the book is neat and filled with good stuff for those who aren not too sure about dating . however only you can decide how the advice in the book will be used . some of the information in this book you will look at and say duh and some you will say will have to remember . do with this book what you will . above all , have fun !
1			community	medical	obsession	cultural	comedy	good	parents	foolish			i usually enjoy a good comedy . . but not this . the cultural obsession with removing flesh from the genitals of children has come under increasing attack in recent years . perhaps that is why the ghouls who actually favour the practice feel the need to step up their efforts . brian morris book is a case in point . brian morris book in favour of circumcision consists of much outdated and / or invalid evidence which has not been taken seriously by the medical community for some time . therefore , when one has waded through all the mumbo jumbo , one is left with the rantings and ravings of a very disturbed man with an apparent mutilation fetish and a sick desire to promote the genital cutting of children . although i admit to laughing heartily several times while reading this book , i found my laughter interrupted by the sobering consideration that many foolish parents will take in this nonsense . i m afraid i can not recommend this book to anyone .
1			taste	bad	things	funny			i wish i could forget this movie . here we go . things are funny sometimes . only because a director chose to tell the history backwards , people say it's a masterpiece ! go figure why ! this is a silly movie , witha lot of bad taste , with an evils kin around it . pearce's character is obnoxious , as almost most characters he plays . there's absolutely no dificult to follow the backwards plot , it's just annoying . blergh !
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			reader from glendale ca . agree with the reader from glendale about the prior reviews . please contct me so we discuss .
2			justices	greatest	speech	free	rights	civil	doctrine	free	book	worth	book	great			a great book . as controversial as many of his veiws were , hugo black is considered one of the staunchest defenders of free speech doctrine , especially as a man who sat on the supreme court through the civil rights era . although still controversial , his absolutism led him to to write some of the most impassioned defenses of free speech in his well known dissents . this book is well worth reading as the an expression by one of the greatest justices in history .
2			family	nice	family	great			because of winn dixie . what a great family is sooooo nice to not see violence and sex fill the racks of the video stores . it will bring a smile to your face .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			miserable , misanthropic , mistake . apart from the santaland diaries , which has its amusing moments , this is one dreadful book .
2			appreciation	new			haven not stopped listening to it for a week ! i was given this cd for my birthday last week and haven not gone a day without listening to it ever since . every time i hear it i gain a new appreciation for pete's music . musicforthemorningafter will definitely be a permanent addition to my cd cartridge !
1			movie	new	compass	golden	quest	true	writing	best			surprised and saddened . i have just finished the golden compass and the subtle knife . the new movie , is being promoted as a narnia type story , but the books certainly are not . they are sort of the anti narnia . i m usually very liberal about what i read and watch . however , i would not recommend these books for kids without careful parental supervision . these books are very well written , and have an engaging adventure story . it's probably some of the best writing i have read since the narnia books . the first book on it's own isn not overwhelmingly offensive because being the first in a series , you aren not sure what is up or down . or , at least i wasn not sure if their quest would be the true quest of the whole story . i don not want to give away any spoilers , so i will just conclude that it draws you into a story that seems innocent enough at first glance , but is not . i would not recommend them .
1			it	appropriate no			not firm enough . the roller has the proper dimensions , but deforms under your weight . unfortunately , it's not appropriate for back exercises . i bet it would make an excellent pool floatie , though .
2			movie	great	it	interesting	character	biblical	job	great			dreams come true . this was a great movie . donny did a great job . it was interesting to see how they created a biblical character to music and added some comedy as it was very tastefully done .
2			state	current	illustration	fantastic	pathway	practical	way	modern	thing	best	problems	social	solution	clear			fascinating and reassuring . orr's book is a fantastic illustration of the current state of the world in terms of the relationship between technology , ecology , design and economy from a theoretical philosophical perspective . he does not brush anything under the carpet and provides a very broad and deep understanding of our incompetence as a society saturated with consumption to deal with the consequences of our modern way of life . the best thing about this book , in comparison with other books in the subject , is first of all that it provides a highly engaging read , and second of all that it offers a very clear solution to our social and environmental problems to live within and according to nature's limits . orr's argument is convincing , not only because it is supported by many beautiful references , but mainly because it provides a very practical and honest pathway to the future .
1			control	suck	it	cool			too expensive . i would say , don not do it . if you really feel you want this car . the remote control on this car sucks . you have to push both buttons up and it gets confusing when you want it to go left or right . you don not get smooth turns . you get alot of spin outs . and it might scratch your if you just want to play with it and not drive much , then it's cool to get .
2			i	happy	growers	serious	use	good	book	solid			growers and marijuana users will like this very much . i agree with the other reviewers and i am very happy that i bought it . the cannabis grow bible by greg green is a solid grow book for serious growers . i really like it because there is enough information here to keep me going for a long time . i learned quite a bit just flicking through it and i am sure all growers will make good use it for some time to come . take a hint from what the reviewer said below about seeds and this book . this book makes economical sense for what it will help you to achieve . peace .
1			rating	good	minutes	boring	graphics	ok	movie	entire	background	horrible	minutes	entire	it	bad	it	cool			not all that . i can tell you r . e . is nothing like its hyped up to be . advertisments make it look like the scariest movie of our time . i admit , it was cool to see a bunch of infected zombies walkin around eating people , but the background of the movie was horrible . the entire first 45 minutes were the most boring 45 minutes of any movie . it gets better , but the zombies arent scary at all and it just needs more suspense . the entire movie was a sinch to predict . thats what makes it bad . if you go to see a horror movie and you can predict when there will be a zombie at every turn , its not gonna be that scary . the graphics were ok , but it just didnt have that ew and ahhhhhhhh -0 like the game . the point i m trying to make is that the 2 d r . e . movie is gonna need a lot of work to get a good rating from me .
1			mother	dead	flop	total			a messed up musical . this story line kept drifting from a dead mother to a mistress to a wife and movie writer that couldn not . it zigged and zagged so many times i felt dizzy . this certainly was no chicago or cabaret . too many dips and not very entertaining . a total flop in my opinion .
2			it	useful			excellent item . excellent item ! it's very useful in my work everyday . the shipment arrived very fa st thanks for all . i recommend it .
2			looks	attractive	it	hot	they	available	cabinet	small	me	crazy			hair dryer at your fingertips ! we were always leaving the hair dryer on the counter as it was hot and we didn not want to put it away where it might touch something . then off we went and it sat on the counter until the next time it was needed . drove me crazy ! yes , i could have picked it up and put it away , but that just didn not happen most of the time . thought if hotels had these wall mounts , then they might be available out there . we have purchased three of these for different bathrooms , had them for quite awhile now and never had an issue with them failing after a few months . easy to mount . alot more attractive than a dryer sitting around on a counter or taking up needed space in the small cabinet under the sink . love the night light , it is out of the way , shuts off when you replace it , and looks attractive . would recommend this definitely .
1			himself	great	album	worst			the meatloaf spoiled ! first let me say i have all of meatloafs cds , most replaced the records i have . that being said , this outing does not deserve to wear the bat out of hell title . meatloaf himself is still great , but this is the worst meatloaf album i have hea rd very few highlights on this one and none that i would speak of . this cd will remain on my shelf forever !
2			start	great	series	entire	character	main			great start to the series ! i have read the entire first series twice through and into the wild is a great start to the series . the main character is rusty , a kittypet house cat who is invited to join a group of forest cats names thunderclan after a fight with an apprentice named greypaw . when he becomes part of the clan he is named firepaw . but what does ravenpaw , another apprentice , know about tigerclaw , a warrior of thunderclan ? who killed redtail really ? and what does the dream that bluestar and spottedleaf received mean ? fire shall save the clan . just a couple of words of warning . make sure you read into the wild before any of the others or you won not have a clue whats going on !
1			acting	bad	filmmaking	poor			i would like to give this no stars ! abyssmal garbage that looks as if it were made on bad 16 m on one heckuva shoestring budget . everything fails , bad acting , poor filmmaking , this one bites ! terror at lake tenkiller was better !
2			moron	complete	world	complete	reading	great	book	enjoyable	guy	good	world	rich	guy	bad	book	solid			no relation to lotr whatsoever ! eragon has nothing to do with the lord of the rings ! it is a different book ! the story is completely different and has a much greater resemblance to star wars than it does lotr . the use and definition of magic is the most obvious difference between eragon and the lord of the rings , and anyone who knows anything about lotr would know this . in eragon , magic is a palpable , outwardly manipulated thing . in lotr it is subtle . i can not explain it . read both books and you are a complete and utter moron or the differences will be completely obvious . eragon was a solid and enjoyable book and i am eagerly anticipating the sequel . it was well written and fast paced and drew me into a rich , complete , and cleverly spun world . the book would be five stars if not for the obvious parallels with star wars . no big . it was still a great book well worth reading , even if secondary bad guy turned out to be the secondary good guy's father .
2			one	best	i	glad	dog	poor	pick	next	survival	typical			an absolute tragedy . always fearful that the next oprah pick might be the best one , i try to read them as soon as they are announced . back roads is once again oprah's typical survival against all odds type of book but i m not sure i could call any of these characters survivors . they are all tragic in their own right even the poor dog elvis . o would ell is certainly a gifted writer challenging the reader to dare to stop reading her book and consequently taking the chance of never knowing how it ended . while it was dysfunctional at best it was also riveting . i would have given it 5 stars if i would have liked the subject matter a little more . i found so much of it disturbing but i kept on reading and have to admit , i m glad i did .
1			off	major	brands	new			major rip off smaller cans / less product / $$price . again , instead of 6 cans of 11 ounces each , now its 4 bottles 10 ounces ea and more money ? ? ? i am not buying slim fast again . a customer for years , publix / kroger / wal mart brands are my new brands !
2			book	great			simple but complete . i would not be getting such a great book if not sybex , which has lots of advance examples , tips and tricks . finally and most of all , it's the most valueble book that give you the overview of the advance level . i mostly recommend that you must buy this book , trust me and you won not regret !
1			book	terrible			waste of time . terrible book , confusing , disgusting , disturbing . very hard to follow . a waste of my time and eyesight . cliffnotes are at least 1000 times better than the book itself . waste of paper .
2			i	surprised	it	popular			a fun wonka like trek . i read this solely on the fact it is sooo popular . i was pleasently surprised at the contents . it seems very inspired by dahl and his wonka books . the film version seems to have tim burton written all over it ! he would bring te childlike yet still appealing to adults vision the book crys out for . a casting suggestin would be john rhys davies as hagrid . all in all a fun book . i may venture now into the sequels , after i go join a pagan cult .
2			em	high	effects	special	fun	good	you	surprised	films	best	school	high			class of nuke em high is a troma tizing classic ! this is one of the best films out of the troma film library , next to the toxic avenger of course ! the story is about a nuclear power plant that is leaking radiation onto the nearby high school , and turning it's students into the opposites of what they are . nerds turn into psycho's , preps turn into perverts , and a teen gives birth to a mutant slug that falls into toxic waste and then turns into a giant monster that stalks the high school halls . sound complicated ? it's not . just pick this one up , you might be surprised . the acting and special effects may seem cheesy , but it's all in good fun .
2			point	great	i	anxious			couldn not put it down , was hungry for more when i finished . i am a firm believer in live and let live . however , when someone comes up to me and hands me anti catholic literature it angers me . mostly because it is so full of lies . i don not believe any of those things they say i believe in . so naturally , books such as this in our defense are inevitalbe and greatly needed . it was a great starting point for me and i am anxious to read some of the many suggestions he offered at the end .
2			item	great	hardcover	great	it	nice	read	easy			great item ! i have been on a sci fi literature kick lately and picked up this great hardcover the other week . never read the story before , and i m playing catch up with the classics of sci fi right now . i liked this story a lot , it's quick and easy read , but refreshing . i don not read much as i m more of a movie watcher myself , but it was nice to read a sci fi story like this . the characters acted logical , and weren not treated viciously by the story . for anyone who hasn not read it , i m i was one of the last , read it !
2			hahaha	entertaining	show	great			great show , good times indeed . a masterpiece , i truly enjoyed the behind the scenes footage . dirty sexy crafty , hahaha that was truly entertaining . i wish i could start my own network and bring back dsm ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
2			idea	great			great idea . no more fumbling with a custom oil filter wrench and working around the crank position sensor ! the six sided hex on the end of the filter makes changing oil a breeze !
1			chapter	hard	it	hate	it	ok	book	slow	ending	boring	it	easy			it was okay . i had to read this book for school , and at first i hated it . the beginning chapter is hard to understand because of all the symbolism , however , it eventually gets better . slowly it is easy to miss some concepts if you don not read slowly enough . i felt that the ending was far fetched and boring . i did enjoy reading about a dystopian society , but altogether , the book is tedious and slow moving .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			linda . unfortunately , two of the six rolling pins broke the first time they were used . the red handles came off . i tried gluing them back on , but that didn not work . i wouldn not purchase this item again .
2			i	surprised	movie	funny			outrageous , funny , sexy . this movie is so funny . when i first saw it i laughed so hard i almost wet my pants . i guarentee you will love this movie . if you don not enjoy this movie i will be very surprised .
2			effects	special	collection	basic	cheating	little	carelessness	little	serial	important	names	familiar	collection	serial	endings	great	acting	good	serials	best			a little cheating , but spectacular . special effects and set decorations make this definitely one of the best serials of all time . i do give it 4 stars rather than 5 because of the cheating in a couple of chapters . especially one of the great chapter endings ever , chapter 8 only to discover the cheating at the beginning of chapter 9 also a little more than usual carelessness . corrigan is bare headed at the beginning of one sequence and is suddenly wearing the cumbersome helmet . a chariot and team of horses unexplainably is waiting right by where they need it . but hey , don not you expect a bit of that in serials ? it's the spectacle , developing plot , good acting that make this an important serial for your collection . lots of familiar names in this one including lon chaney jr . william farnum , monte blue as the villain , smiley burnette as the comic relief , lee van atta as the feisty definitely should be in your basic serial collection .
1			you	odd	it	dull			i like salinger , but this isn not one of his best . this is a book about a brother and a sister . they both have problems in life , and it's just a story about a few days in their lives . it was kind of weird , and didn not really seem to have a point , and just about everyone in the book smoked , and it makes you want to start smoking or was just odd . i wouldn not really recommend this book to many people , because it was pretty dull .
2			examples	great	details	specific	ideas	outstanding			excellent resource . this was an excellent resource witll outstanding ideas . it occasionally lacks specific details of the methods but makes up for that with great examples . a must read for anyone who works with other people .
2			menus	easy	handset	small no	value	good	phone	great			very good value for the money . this is a great phone . the handset is not small , so it is convenient to hold with the shoulder . the menus are easy to use . i had no problems with the phone . the only drawback i see that you cannot add to the phonebook the number you just dialed . there is no intervention with wireless computer network .
1			disappointment	big	topic	important	topics	basic			this book is outdated . i love o are illy books but this one was a big disappointment . no mention of vectors no use of namespace no discussion of inheritance in classes generally outdated publish date 1995 . these topics alone are so commonly used in beginning c courses that the omission of these topics so basic to c is really horrifying . i ended up giving up on the book . after several attempts to refer to it for my classes i found it not just lacking in an explanation , but completely missing the topic . i just put the book in the corner to collect du st o are illy really needs a better book than this one for such an important topic .
2			lover	true	music	easy	music	sweet	disco	dead no			if you love disco you will love this . this cd was filled with the sweet easy hustle music that any true disco lover would know . if you hustled to disco you will love this , especially romeo & juliet on the cd . disco is defintely not dead . trust me .
2			book	difficult			an endearing read . i highly recommend this book to any girl who is a romantic at heart . i felt as though i could relate to cassandra on many levels ; her story is timeless . this book is difficult to put down . i fell in love with all of the characters , their quirky personalities making them all the more endearing . excellent writing , wonderful story . a
2			movies	classic	christmas	classic	value	great			classic christmas collection wonderful life / white christmas . anyone who loves these classic movies will love these dvds . these movies are more and more rarely seen in their entirety on tv this is a wonderful opportunity to see them in their entirety . a great value !
2			sauce	hot	ski	hot			best no worry wax . i ski in the east , where you may ski 40 degree afternoons , followed by 10 degree night skiing . i have been using hertel super hot sauce for over 20 years , and my only complaint is it's performance in extreme cold powder sub zero . slap on some hot sauce and go ski !
1			store	local			size is not accurate . i bought two medium size of this product . one obvieously is larger than the other . both were too small for me even though i carefully measured my knee before ordering . i had to send them back and bought midium size ace product from local drug store , which is just right size wise .
1			film	worst	author	great	dialog	bad	turns	wrong	book	great			this is the worst film ever made ! don not buy this tape , its bad . very bad . really . definition of a tragedy a great book from a great author turned into a disaster by that crazy lynch fellow . calling this dreck a film is too much of a compliment . ed wood could have done a better job at least you can laugh at plan 9 from outer space . what's really galling about this trash is that you can see all the wrong directorial turns coming in the film right before they happen . bad dialog , marginal acting and hearing characters thoughts throughout the flick all contribute to this failure of a should take the proceeds from video sales and use them to re make this film into something watchable . its worse than watching paint dry . it should get -20 stars but amazon won not permit that
2			it	confusing	book	interesting	it	creative	ending	happy	way	good	it	unique			the giver reviews . i thought that this book was very interesting and out of the ordinary . in a good way . it was very creative and unique . i like how they explained the different jobs that everyone got . jonas was my favorite character . at the beginning of the book , i thought that the title didn not fit the book until i got to about the middle . i wish that some of our city rules and laws were like that . i really enjoyed this book because i like reading fantasy books and you could tell that this one was . i makes me wonder if the future could will really be like this . the things that i didn not really like about it was that , it was alittle confusing at first but most books are . i also wish that there had been a more happy ending , and alittle more details on what happened next . i really did like enjoy this book and i would encourage you to read it too .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			falta mas especificaciones . buenas tardes deberian informar mas sobre el producto por ejemplo si vienen los 2 cilindros cuantas llaves trae si tienen un combro con cilindros y swichera ser mas especificos en cuanto al producto se refiere
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			started with such promise . the first chapter of this novel just sweeps you off your feet . it was so promising that i kept reading at breakneck speed hoping for the pay off . instead what i got was sleezy stephen king rip offs . oh how sad that such a talent went for potboiler instead of profound . much like his alter ego character , mr ellis got lost instead of making the effort to be found .
2			atenttion	nice			hones people . i have a lot of problems with the product , but these peopole every time respond with oportunity a nice atenttion
1			acting	weak	thing	crappy			horrible , save your $$$ . it's no wonder the studios decided to convert this movie into 3 with no plot , weak acting , and pitiful directing , if it had been released in 2 , audiences might have noticed how crappy this thing is instead of being distracted by colorful 3 images . buyer beware ! !
1			box	open	i	excited	ray	awesome	models	available	control	poor			beware , replica falls apart . i ordered this set back in november . i didn not open it until the beginning of march because i didn not have a blu ray player until then . i was excited to crack the box open and proudly display the replica of the enterprise on my desk , but as soon as i pulled it out of the styrofoam packaging , one of the warp engine nacelles just fell off . my bad for not opening it sooner , but now amazon does not have any of these left to replace it and i m left with a ship without an engine . poor quality control here folks ! the blu ray is awesome , however , so don not waste your money on this set , just buy the blu ray and wait until better models are available which i hope is someday soon .
2			cd	good	it	good			pretty good . this cd came out in 95 and was played on the radio much but it was still good . i guess jamie had less star power to promote the album back then . some people are complaining about the price , well thats what happens when cds are out of print . i like the songs experiment , doghouse , the mo st experiment is a smooth sexy jam . and then dog house is a funky joint i think it uses a george clinton sample . some of the other songs are to slow for me . but the ladies should like them . this is a good cd though .
1			set	complete			missing box ? i ordered this zoey 1010 complete season 3 set . the write up says it comes with 5 discs . but there are only 3 discs in the box . i see the review states it should come in two boxes , and maybe i am missing a box ? i returned the box , and now re ordered , hoping to get both boxes for this complete season 3 set . wish me luck !
2			novel	great	summary	great			great , but not for a first vonnegut read . i just finished this book , and i absolutely loved it . this was the last vonnegut novel i hadn not read , and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other that end , i wouldn not recommend it as a first vonnegut read . it's almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in 's a great novel , no doubt , with a very satisfying ending . but if you have heard about kurt vonnegut and you just want to try it out , try slaughterhouse five , hocus pocus , cat's cradle , or mother night . you really can not go wrong with this amazing author , but god bless you mr rosewater might come off as a bit preachy if you don not know what you are getting being said , it is still a great novel . so if you are a fan , read this book .
1			it	hate	book	new	it	good	it	wrong	pictures	good			it's pretty good , would be better without all the knocking ! this is one of those love it or hate it books depending on how much of john clements style you can take . i really like the idea of a martial art based on medeival sword fighting , but mr clements does waste a lot of time knocking other people . i think he is just so into what he's doing that he thinks everyone else is trying to do the same thing and getting it wrong . however , fantasy game players are not trying to do martial arts , they are just having fun ! evereyone knows that movie actors aren not really fighting , they are just acting ! parts of this book do came across like advertising for haca , but that's fair enough . the pictures are good and there is a lot of information in this book that was new to me . i just wish he had stuck to the point . this book is not very organised and contains too much knocking !
1			faith	good	feelings	good			horrifying . already mailed review twice to costumer service no response , so here again this cd is horrifying , caused me to have nightmares and heart palpitations since it sounds as if ghosts howl and moan , it was so unrelaxing and uncomfortable that i cannot in good faith even give it half a point , how this is supposedly healing and creating good feelings is way beyond me . i want my money back and a cd with dolphin / ocean sounds that truly is healing and relaxing .
2			economics	basic	good	common	ideal	unknown	concise	clear	fallacies	rare			a brilliant , well written economics primer . hazlitt presents a clear , concise lesson on basic economics . his message is well articulated and well supported . this is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted or is planning to do either because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice . unfortunately , there are some erroneous ideas in this book . hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy ; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the common good . however , these fallacies are rare , and they do not significantly detract from the a great back to back lesson in economics and its moral base , read this book followed by capitalism the unknown ideal by ayn rand .
1			it	good			boring . for more than half of the book i wanted to throw it out the window . sure it was good at the end , but the only reason i kept reading was because i had to read it for summer reading .
1			waste	total	book	great	book	bad			great book written from the perspective of a 15 h century dark ages idiot who's thoughts inspired the events of the inquisition . to say this book is bad is an understatement . from the introduction stating that witches conjured lucifer it quickly went down hill from there . this author if you want to call her that , is living in the dark ages and probably would have been in collaboration with sprenger and kramer if given the chance . do yourself a favor . if you are looking for a book on magic and wicca or witchcraft look elsewhere . this is a total waste of your time . you have been forewarned .
1			point	satisfied	evidence	scientific	tastes	good	tastes	various	books	available			a disappointment . the author develops his ideal diet based on the scientific evidence that we have the ability to sense various tastes , such as sweet , sour , bitter , etc so far , so good . he then suggests that our brain has set points for these and if we eat one of the tastes , such as sweet , we have to keep eating this until the set point is satisfied . maybe . where this falls apart in my mind is his dietary suggestions , supposedly evolved from the above observations . that is , such things as the peach diet , where the only consistency throughout is the peach with plenty of other opportunities for sour , bitter , savory set points being initiated . i consider this book largely just another reworking of other dietary books already available , with the slight twist of discussing taste as an issue , but not really following through with that so well .
2			book	little	package	little			a neat little book . i haven not finished reading this book , but i can tell you , it's a neat one . alice in wonderland , and through the looking glass , all in one neat little package . it's even got an introduction that i found enlightening . go ahead and buy it .
1			product	poor	price	low	product	sharp	service	sharp	service	poor	assistance	little			poor product poor sharp service . stopped accepting dvds in tray after 6 months , endless problems with sharp's authorised dealer in houston . sharp is of little assistance it is going onto 1 year now . do not recommend this player and will think twice about buying any sharp product their service is extremly poor . even for this low price not worth it .
1			it	nice	niece	young			no theme ? i was really looking forward to getting this set and sharing it with my young niece and nephew not to mention being taken back to my own childhood . like most other reviewers , i am disappointed in this set . i can deal with the fuzzy cartoons but i can not believe they left off the opening and closing credits with the theme song how and why would they do that ? it would have been nice to see my niece and nephew singing along with the catchy theme song . oh well .
1			dvd	happy no	sound	good no			not happy . i bought a dvd the sound is not good the dvd was about $ 3.50 im not happy as to return it i have to pay postage which is more than the dvd
1			cookbook	bad no	recipes	good	ideas	new			not worth the insane price . i thought this book would be some sort of wonderful , seeing the price reading the hype on it . it isn not a bad cookbook by any means , i like that it has new ideas for some handy tips . however , i would never buy this for myself it was a gift , simply because it is definitely not worth the price tag . i guess if you have the money , go for if not . i m sure you can find good recipes online . this cookbook uses a lot of not so everyday so you definitely have to plan ahead with the recipes .
1			singer	new			can we say over rated ? i can not even hear the lead singer over the music in the song's . the band can really play but they need a new singer , and they need to fix their production value so you can hear everything clearly . i can not believe this was so hyped on mtv 2 way overated . check out these better bands . blindsideproject 86 hevellejuliana theorycrash rickshawbrandtsonmxpx
1			movies	worst	review	helpful no			i m falling asleep just thinking about it . this was possibly one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i don not mind if this review is not helpful to you , i just needed to get that off my che st don not see this if you have a pulse .
2			book	excellent			multiple streams of internet income . how ordinary people make extraordinary money online . the book was excellent and gave me several very exciting ways to make money in this economy . i also received it in a very timely manner in excellent condition .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			absolute crap low def ! must say i was very only reason i bought this dvd was beqause it was filmed in hi def and they go on and on about the excelent hi def guess what , as soon as you open everything they have written on the dvd it self this dvd has been down converted to work with existing dvd technology . so there is no hi def quality to be seen here and it is actually lower quality than any other dvd i ever tested . i m looking forward to the day when you will be able to search for actual hi def movies on amazon and find some movies that are actually hi def when you play them ; so any way neither as an aquarium dvd or hi def is this disk any regards
2			i	free	visitor	happy	neighborhood	new			defender of the yard . i bought this because several dogs run free in my new neighborhood and have been leaving me morning deposits in my ya rd not wanting to keep receiving these gifts , i needed a way to keep these visitors from coming back . however , i wanted a humane manner in which to do this . i purchased the scarecrow and it has done wonders for me . no more deposits . no more foul smells . now i have a happy , visitor free ya rd i can not think of a better way to keep my property poo free .
2			music	great			blast from the past . discovered the song shine as end credit music on a dvd . what can i totally caught my ear . great music & lyrics . a keeper for sure . nuff said .
1			editing	bad	scene	entire	movie	classic			bad editing . the giant behemoth is a classic brit scfi movie . the problem with the vhs version is that the entire ferry boat scene was omitted . the dvd version is unedited and the quality is much better . the vhs probably came from the public domain .
2			performances	effective	story	dramatic	cast	entire			intriguing drama of sibling conflict . beautiful ohio stars william hurt and rita wilson as simon and judith messerman , progressive parents who want nothing but the best for their two boys , clive david call and william brett davern . clive , a math prodigy seemingly a shoo in for the top prize at an upcoming mathematics competition , often disconnects from his doting parents by speaking in a made up language that nobody but himself can understand . william , on the other hand , is just trying to get by as he struggles to work his way out from under the shadow of his elder sibling . director chad lowe has elicited effective performances from the entire cast and fashioned a dramatic story that could easily have gone the way of dreary soap opera . instead , it draws us into the family with humor , emotion , and intelligent pacing . the bare bones dvd contains no extras .
1			flicka	dead	movie	horrible			my dead flicka . i refuse to see this movie and i urge anyone who cares about the welfare of horses and animals to do so as well . this is not a movie for horse lovers . fox killed 2 horses in the making of this horrible movie and then tried to cover it up and did nothing to try to help . look it up for yourself ! boycott flicka ! let fox know this is not ok !
1			mouse	big	mouses	regular			mini it isn not . i don not know how they could advertise this as a mini mouse . it's maybe 1 4 inch shorter than my regular size mouses / mice ? and the same width . i bought it for my asus eee computer , so the mini mouse was way too big for my mini laptop . i was hoping for something the size of my targus mini mouse , which broke . it's about 2 -1 2 times the size ! i can not tell you how it works , as i returned it immediately .
1			girl	old	songs	good	album	next			a little redundant . while there are some good songs on this album don not say you love me , our song , girl in your dreams , they wear out quickly unless your really into teenie bopper pop music , or your a 13 year old girl . mostly all the songs just seem like variations of the same theme . the only thing that about m 2 that caught my attention is don not say you love me from the pokemon soudtrack and i dont even like pokemon . from what i have heard , their next album is just going to be more of the same .
2			memory	great			favorite ! this is a movie we used to watch on vhs and now we can watch it again on our dvd . thanks for bringing back a great memory !
1			puppets	scary	they	scary			the puppets are too scary . everytime my 2 year old sees the puppets in this video , he asks that the video be turned off because he says they are too scary . but he likes other portions of the video , especially the monkey dance and the fruit salad songs where he actually dances to the rythy ms
1			seat	flimsy	strap	flimsy	strap	short	i	pleased no	sides	weak	armrests	flimsy			middle strap too short and seat is flimsy . today was the first time my daughter used this seat and i was not pleased with i came here to see the reviews . needless to say , the exact things i didnt like are the same complaints others had . the middle strap is way too short ! ! my daugther was sceaming also when i was trying to buckle it . the armrests are also flimsy and i was just waiting for the day until my daughter snapped them off . the sides also are weak . i just excepted more for the price . nothing like my marathon britax . thanks everyone for validating my thoughts . i will be returning mine too .
2			artist	great	album	big	music	concerned			i love merle's music . i knew some day merle would record a big band album and i have been waiting for can not hardle do anything bad as far as music is concerned . if you are a dyed in the wool merle haggard fan as i am you will buy this album . the four songs that make it worth the purchase are , i can not get started still missing you going away party and my most favorite of all , what love can do this man is a great artist !
2			journeys	personal			a wonderful book for pilots and dreamers alike . richard bach describes the marvel of flight so well in his easily digested shorts about airplanes , personal journeys , and philosophy . i almost don not need the book anymore several of the stories are so easily recalled , not for their context of wings and propellers and runways , but for the enthusiastic care for freedom and self determination that bach extends to the reader .
1			singer	original			let down . not a gem in the mix . becoming x stays on top . spin spin suggar great . this ones dull . bring back the original female singer .
2			read	good			gather together in my name . there's no question why children all over the world are advised to read this book . this is the second of maya angelou's books that i have read , and i really enjoyed it . it's truthful and honest , but frankly , some parts of the book disgusted me . but , although i don not agree with some of the author's choices , this book is a good read . however , because of some of the content , i would only recommended it to a mature reader . if you want to read a book which doens not hide the fact that everyone makes mistakes , give this one a try .
1			fish	biggest	book	unbelievable	he	sorry	shark	good	you	sorry	man	old			the fish swim away in fear of reading this shark tale . this book , old man and the sea , is so immensely unbelievable it isn not even funny . exhibit a it says in the book that the marlin was longer than the skiff . come on , sometimes it takes 2 people to handle a good size shark . on another note , how is it possible for a single old man to hold onto fish that size for that duration of time ? then there are many paragraphs were he goes on and on about how he is sorry for hooking the fish . if you are that sorry for hooking that fish let the thing go . i mean , if you are that torn up about it , then better you live and let it go than get killed adn catch the biggest fish ever . i mean thats just my opinion . well thanks for reading my review . many of hemmingway's other works are good . thank you .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the alpha and omega of literature . conrad says it all in less than 100 book gets better every year .
1			message	general	fan	huge	they	intriguing	it	worth			lackluster installment . while i m a huge fan of the first two series of monarch of the glen , this series really just fails to live up to any kind of a standa rd with jullian fellowes as killwillie out of the picture and no more hector , it seems this series just tries to aim for tackiness . i do recommend the first two series highly as they are intriguing and provide an interesting insight into scottish highland customs , but this installment is just at best overbearing . the plot lines are forced and the general message is cheapness . i really don not even think it is worth bothering with . sorry to be negative , but i m not sure what the bbc was thinking on this one .
1			product	good no	card	dead			it's not a good product . i ordered this sd card last december but i did not use it until a month ago . i used it for a dashboard camera for cars . the sd card was dead when storage was fully used . it can not be read or detected by computer or dashboard camera anymore so i have no way to re format it . my dashboard camera works with other sd cards without any problem . now this sd card is a trash to me .
2			service	exceptional	product	great			puma knive . the product is great , and was shipped in the correct date . there is nothing more to say but the service is exceptional .
1			producer	good			what a dumb song . what this song amounts to , basically , is another advertisment for darkchild ; the producer rodney jenkins . while jenkins is a good producer , must he say or have his name said in the song ? this was what puffy did and now he is gone . and i was never thrilled with him and his materialistic boasting all up in the song . he really spoiled faith evans song all night long doing about the song and toni braxton ; this song is a backward step for mrs braxton who has paid her dues with her debut album . this song seems like something the yet mature tlc would do aside from that no scrubs garbage they put out a couple years back . toni braxton is of a higher caliber than ; this cd single has a david morales radio mix for you are making me high , a butt kicker from 1996 short and sweet and to the point .
2			merchant	local	couple	young	tv	classic	adventure	visual			excellent western adventures . both the opening and closing themes of this classic tv show help to establish the boundaries for an excellent audio / visual western adventure . all four episodes are built around a formula , but it's a workable , proven formula . the plots are well developed for the alloted time and the characters are comfortably the train robbery roy discovers that a local merchant is working with the robbers to take the $ 50 000 loot . he successfully uncovers the villans and saves the town . in ride in the death wagon roy escapes a sinister plot and keeps a widow from being taken advantage of . in shoot to kill an eastern city slicker is caught up in trying to deceive people with his photos , pretending that pat brady is an outlaw , but the tables are turned on him . and in ranch war roy saves the day for a young couple in preventing greedy men from taking the family ranch .
1			products	worst	piece	nice			a nice , shiny piece of junk . this phone crashes all the time . it has trouble charging it won not recognize the charge plug , even sometimes during a charge , so it won not actualy cahrge at all . i have a hard time making calls taht are not in my area code t mobile recognized this did t mobile . don not waste your money . buy motorola sometimes those work or nokia . sony makes the worst products , be it stereos , headphones , cd players or cell phones .
1			thing	good	attempt	horrible	girl	little	thing	worst			worst thing to happen to the omen . this is a horrible attempt of an omen sequal . thi should not even have the same name . and since when is the antichrist a girl isn not the devil's son a guy ? the only good thing about this movie is that the little girl is more menacing then damien .
1			encounters	sexual	others	readable	style	elementary			is this the same chevalier who wrote pearl earring ? girl with a pearl earring was an extraordinary novel , with its simplicity and subtlety and intriguing characters . lady and the unicorn is its opposite , with shallow characters , a silly plot , and an unengaging , elementary writing style . the overabundant references to sex and the raunchy sexual encounters are nauseating . i have read all of chevalier's books , and while none are even in the same league as earring , at least the others were readable . the fact that this book revolves around a beautiful piece of art is immaterial ; it belongs in the dime store novel genre .
1			i	happy no	look	new no			buyer beware . the book did not look new . looked as if it was sitting on the shelf for years . i was not happy with the appearance of the book .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			hooray ! i have been using this peel several times a week for 3 weeks . it has drastically improved my skin tone and texture . i was hoping to reduce some of my acne scarring , and this has definitely helped . i can not wait to see how my skin looks in another month ! it does burn a bit , and it is imperative to moisturize after . i hope it helps your skin , too !
1			skepticism	healthy	references	medical	articles	medical	attacks	personal	fox	new	look	professional no			personal attacks off putting . the author needs to be commended on finding the 160 or so medical references to support his position . in the process he needed to overlook or dismiss 10 or more medical articles that did not agree with his bias for each article he found that he agreed with . like fox new , any claim to being unbiased should be viewed with healthy skepticism . while the author should be allowed to advocate his bias , he should stick with the facts rather than resort to ad hominem attacks . doing so makes him look desperate and unprofessional .
1			movie	good no			get it in the horror classics collection instead . i can tell you this is not a good movie , and i know that you like me will want to see it anyway . go ahead , but don not waste your money on this dvd . get the horror classics collection 50 movie pack instead , where this movie is included , and you get 49 other movies at pretty much the same price .
2			deniro	great	reel	good	dvd	ok			this ain not the sopranos , but it's frickin funny . if you like the mafia , you have to see this billy crystal and robert deniro are great together , and this has some of the funniest mob moments like where he's trying to be a mobster , or where he askes you don not here the word no very often , do you ? and deniro replies i do , but it's more like no ! please god ! dont know ! or where he asks robert deniro to hit a pillow , so he pulls out his gun and starts shooting it . the dvd is ok , it's got a good gag reel , plus commentary from crystal and deniro but not much else . definately one of the funniest movies i have seen in a long time .
2			grounding	great	woman	young	mexico	new	fe	old	statehood	ultimate	inn	old			great read on a southwest vacation ! this book is on loan in each guest room of the old santa fe inn in santa fe , nm . my husband and i stayed there our first night of a southwest road trip , and i so enjoyed the first few chapters of wind leaves no shadow that i purchased a copy for myself . great grounding in the early history of new mexico from the perspective of a young woman who ultimately owns her own gambling salon in old santa fe . spanning the area's rule under spain , new mexico , and ultimate statehood plus gold fever , ongoing indian conflict and tension with all parties plus texans i recommend the history and the adventure !
2			they	worth	size	normal	they	comfortable			i love my frye campus boots ! i was a little afraid of spending the money but believe me they are worth it ! they are very comfortable , fit well i ordered my normal size and they come about 3 inches below my knee , and soooo stylish . i wear them with dresses , jeans , even under khaki pants . i have had many people ask me about them , in fact a girl at a restaurant the other night approached me just to tell me she loved my boots ! they are very well made and will last forever . i highly encourage every woman to purchase a pair ! !
2			pan	heavy	storage	easy	workhorse	great			swedish pancakes just like grandma used to make ! great for making swedish pancakes , eggs , you name it . no oil needed everything slides out of the pan with ease . cooks evenly and holds heat well . this is a heavy , mulitpurpose pan that i know i will get years of use from . small enough for easy storage but large enough to be a great kitchen workhorse . one of my favorite kitchen tools !
2			i	good	you	young	movie	ok	gift	great	movie	good			a good movie if you are young . this movie is ok , but it is more focused on littler can tell that it is by the songs and stuff . this movie doesent really go indepth on some of the key events that happen in the if you dident know about all those events it's a good i sugjest that you watch the movie before you read the book , but make sure you read the movie is a great gift for a younger brother or sister .
1			cripples	emotional			i watched the whole film and now i wonder why i did . i kept waiting to care about the characters in this film but , after wasting the nearly 2 hours it took to get to the end of the story , i found that none of the characters had a single redeeming or likable quality and i couldn not have cared less about how any of them ended up . i will admit that i have never much liked helen hunt as an actor but , since i do usually like the other leading actors , i didn not but should have followed my better instincts to just shut the film this film shows are 4 different examples of totally messed up adults that never managed to mature . the only grown up decision was made by one of the characters at the age of 15 beyond that , nothing but emotional cripples . sound like your cup of tea ? it sure doesn not come close to mine ! i would recommend you pass on this one . 2 stars instead of 1 simply because i like watching a couple of the actors . probably should have given it only 1 star .
1			cd	suck	beats	repetitive	list	short	man	suck	all	suck	metal	heavy			these guys are a joke . man , this cd and all of cannibal corpse's cds suck ! the beats are extremely repetitive and are completely lousy , the guitar riffs are even worse , the lyrics are beyond disgusting , the lead singer can not scream well at all and when when he trys it sounds like he's got a sh load of food in his mouth . most christian heavy metal groups blow this crap away ! to give you a short list , living sacrifice , zao , extol , project -86 blindside , pod . eternal decision , piller , embodyment and travail . if you ever some how get a hold of this cd , first smash the hell out of it with a sledgehammer and burn it ! ! peace .
1			piece	black	side	wide	piece	useless	thing	solid	price	reasonable	it	awkward			breaks quickly . i bought one of these , thinking that the price is pretty reasonable . i got what i paid you try to slide out the grater , so that you can clean inside of the ridges that hold the two plates into place , it's awkward , because you have to align it just so , or else it won not come out . i would toss it in the dishwasher after using it . after the first round we don not use the drying cycle , because it costs so much electricity , it came out with multiple cracks along the side . a couple months later , the plastic underneath the fine grater broke off . that made it so that the black piece up top is absolutely useless , because now it won not rest comfortably on the table . then , the wide side broke . i went to walmart , and got an $ 8 box grater . that thing is solid .
1			music	traditional	music	popular	credits	tiny			dissapointed . if you want traditional tibetan music this is not the reco rd unfortunately , when you buy the cd there is no indication something is amiss unless you read the tiny pin size credits on the back that mention taiwan . and the chinese names of the performers is a give away , but you cannot read them until you open the cd by then , too late to return it . if you like chinese popular music this is the cd for you .

1			thinkers	critical			waste of time . this book is advocating an elitist and pointless view of education . bennett , has missed the core issues of what it means to be an educated person , especially in our every widening global society . bennett advocates a people who are full of facts and trivia knowledge rather than pushing students to be critical thinkers who can solve problems , read with intelligence , and interact with the world from a stance of tolerance and intelligence . there is no yard stick that can measure intelligence . what rubbish . this book is designed to shame parents rather then educate anyone . don not waste your time .
1			i	upset	thing	good			country gospel . i was a little upset when i receive my cd . it was shown as a three disc set but i only received one cd of the three . the cd is the case was different then the what the case showed . only good thing was that i did receive a country gospel cd just not what i ordered and i would be too much of a hastle to return .
1			technique	literary	book	difficult	salts	real	waste	total	story	little			a most wretched book . bottom of the barrel . looking for a bit of sea adventure ? fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them ? well don not go looking to redmond o hanlon's trawler . o hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas and blends them into a putrid stew of is a very difficult book to read . physically difficult ! aye ! o hanlon's pointless , manic use of exclamation and emphasis emphasis ! aye ! lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story , it's really no loss . trawler dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel . i found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by o hanlon . aye ! i won not ! never !
2			anchors	strong no	product	good			needs better supports but good product . good product . solidly built . it is sagging on the wall , with the belts on it . the drywall anchors are not strong enough to hold it securely .
2			companies	familiar	it	interesting			a mu st i love this book . i looked up every cosmetic and skin care product i own , checking for review . i will continue to look up products each time i must replace a used product . it's also interesting to read the product ingredients and also the parent company of many of these name familiar companies .
2			cd	good			wonderful music . i love this cd . it's perfect chill music , but with a holiday tone . it's very chic , without being slick and over mastered . i wish they would come out with a cc 2 very good cd .

2			amount	small			angel eyes works . i have had dogs for many years and many types of dogs . i really dislike any discoloration from tearing even if the dog is not white . finally i found a product that does the job by simply adding a small amount to the food . it does take about a month for the results to show but it really does work . also helps with discoloration around the mouth . love it !
1			enough	good no	picture	good	screen	large	sound	terrible	it	long no			no good . i was really looking forward to a large screen . however when this arrived i was disapointed . when the picture filled the screen it looked way to streched and out of proportion . by the time i had a good picture i could have easily had a much smaller screen . the sound from the speakers is terrible and it will not be long before i buy addition speakers for consider this item , its just not good enough
2			documentary	great	ideal	good	features	extra	i	positive			a great documentary and interviews . i got this video and love it . but i want everyone to know that the henry's review on this is misleading . the guys say it has all of gaga's music videos on one disc . well it is one disc , but there is not even one of her music videos on the disc . i have checked everywhere including the extra features and i m positive . so if you like lady gaga as much as i do , then i think you will like this dvd . but just know you will only see bits and pieces of a few of her videos during the documentary . thankshenry maybe it would be a good ideal to watch dvds before you write a review on it . also if you were just mislead than why didn not you change your review and take that part out of it . people are still just going to read the first part of your review and order this dvd thinking that all her videos are on it and none of them are .
1			part	good			why can not i rate this a 0 . this movie totally blows . i like all the rest of the friday the 13 h movies but this one i rather watch one of those dull julia roberts films then this . jason only appears at the beginning and he possesses souls through out the only good part is that cute girl having sex in the tent and when jason steps on the rubber outside the film i guess took 8.00 to make so don not buy this hunk of garbage

2			dark	best	servings	free	it	great	itself	flawless	seem	flimsy	roast	good	stirring	important	machine	flawless	ground	fresh	roast	strong no			dark is best . i found the mild was undrinkable and the medium barely tolerable . but the dark roast is quite good . its on the starbuck type bitter side , but not as strong . none of these single serving coffee machines will taste like fresh ground . that is why you get some one star reviews for the senseo . i keep the senseo in my office for hassle free single servings and it is great for that . even the dark roast is really not strong enough to qualify as espresso , so i suggest you just use the double packets and make a large is a further hint . use a 10 oz cup , not a standard 8 then put your milk in the cup and microwave for 30 seconds before you make the coffee . after coffee is make make sure to stir with a stirrer . stirring is important and is actually recomended by long as your expectations are down to earth you should enjoy this product . the machine itself has been flawless and doesnt seem flimsy at all .
2			books	serious			i enjoyed this book . i found this book fun to read after reading more serious books in the story , too bad there is no sequel .
1			ticket	current	i	good			the good and the bad . the good i bought this brand passport holder in red because it had a zipper pouch on the backside . i wanted to hold a few dollars there as a convenience . well , it was all that i had hoped for . the convenient zipper compartment until i used this bad the folder that the airline tickets come in would not fit in the case and folding the e tickets prsented a problem , is fine to keep the current airline ticket out the airline folder but when you have multiple boarding passes and ticket receipts it is inconvenient to have to fold the folder to save it in this passport case . also the baggage tickets on on the airline ticket folder . i would love this passport case if it was just a smiggin wider to hold documents because it is the only one i can find with a zipper beware your documents may not fit in this case ! unless they have revised it .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			wont stay running . right out of the box , it wont stay running after it warms up . looking into sending it back or having it serviced , if it has a warranty . very dissatified .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			just kidding around . this book was hilarious . i read it yesterday , and i am still laughing my asimov . get it ? hahahaha . huh . okay . nevermind .
1			stars	stars no	i	disappointed			duplication . i was greatly disappointed because the on line description was vague and this dvd was mostly a duplication of episodes i had previously purchased . i really rate this zero stars but , you have to check at least 1
2			books	special	i	amazed			this is a book you will want to keep on your bookshelf forever . i recommend this to everyone of all ages and reading levels . i fell in love with this book after the first page . i was amazed with wagner's writing style . his poetic descriptions make the characters and the world he writes them into come alive . after reading this book i immediately went back to the beginning and started reading it all over again . this is one of those special books i will read and recommend to everyone again and again .
1			product	poor	buy	poor			extremely poor product and even worse service . never , never , never buy m 500 or any other palm unit . if the unit gets cold below 45 it doesn not work ; if it should slip out of your hands to the seat of your car it doesn not work . i called customer service and was told to send it back . 3 weeks later they say they still do not have it even though i have the tracking receipt which says they have had it for the last 2 weeks . the excuses 1 they have moved the repair center 2 so many units coming back for repair cannot repair fast enough 3 has only been 3 weeks most repairs take longer anyway 4 no one working this week because of the holiday 5 what do you expect me to do about it things take product poor service buy from another company
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			borrow , don not buy . no sense buying this book . plenty of copies of this are sitting gathering dust where kids like mine left them to rot . if you are reading this horrid book hoping it gets better in eldest let me save the trouble by stating emphatically it doesn not .
2			sound	great	something	new	movie	solid	effects	special			this movie breathes life into the sci fi genre . on top of being a solid action movie , this movie definately brings something new to the world of the sci fi movie . after lucas did it with star wars back in the late 70 s , the wachowski brothers do it in the late 90 s . this movie breaks to mold as of late and uses special effects to tell the story and doesn not put them on center dvd is awesome , with plenty of extras . a super clean transfer , and great sound . this moive is a must see .
2			it	good	albums	available	i	happy	novelty	good	bridge	vocal	album	good			good album by a forgotten progressive rock band . this is a 3 -1 2 star album , but i m happy to round up to 4 because it's good to see these albums available on cd . when i looked two years ago , i couldn not find anything by focus for sale . focus is a dutch progressive rock band that mostly does instrumentals , centered on jan akkerman's guitar and thijs van leer's flute . hocus pocus is as good a novelty single as prog rock ever produced , with its combination of power chord guitar , yodeled verse , a vocal bridge that sounds like popeye on uppers , and tull like flute solo . janis is a lovely flute based piece . eruption is a long piece with several repeated riffs ; in true annoying prog rock fashion , each riff is given its own name .
2			program	hard	one	great no			nice . i ordert two of them , one works great the other one not so good , we have to push the botten a few times for it to work . not to hard program .
2			statesa	united	fans	new	mix	awesome	music	good			i couldn not be more impressed ! when i bought this cd , i wasn not quite sure what to expect . sure i have heard help me on the radio , but i wanted a surprise what the rest of the cd as going to be like . i have to say i love it . nick has proved himself , to fans of bsb , and new fans that he wants to try something different . and by all means he did so ! his rock / pop mix is awesome . i think he proved that he can make it as a solo artist not just a member in a group . with songs like blow your mind , this cd has a different vibe for each song . and the fun loving girls in the the united statesa . you cant help but smile when you hear him mention your town . i recommend this cd to anyone who wants to hear good , fun , different music . buy it today , you won not regret it !
2			serial	original	comic	great			great comic . what a hoot ! as one who remembers the radio show and early tv , this was fun to watch . i also have the original movie serial from the 40 s .
2			songs	worth			a perfect follow up . i became an instant fan of josh groban with his debut on my favorite tv show , ally mcbeal . with the release of his self titled first cd , i was ecstatic and blown away . now with closer , his follow up , josh groban has basically become a household name , and he deserves it all . closer is groban's second cd and slowly moves his towards the pop arena . his first cd was a mix of pop and opera with a mix of english , italian , and spanish . this cd is mostly sung in english and still showcaes groban's beautifully gorgeous tenor voice . as with his first cd , all the songs on closer is worth listening to over and over . there is not one to be you haven not heard of josh groban , i suggest you pick up this cd and give him a try . you won not be disappoitned .
1			design	bad	bag	mixed			mixed bag . i really wanted a cover for my bowl for raising dough , covering things to be used later , etc the dip in the lid makes storage hard and takes up a lot of space bad design . i understand why it's there , but how many people store the lid and bowl together ?
1			place	local	number	large	instruction	bad	i	impressed no	footage	nice			don not buy the dvd , and don not buy into the fabricated 5 star reviews . i purchased this as a video , and was not that impressed . it has nice surf footage , but the yoga instruction is really bad . the time would have been better spent slowing going through each yoga pose , versus racing through a large number of poses . skip this dvd , take a lesson at your local yoga place .
1			accessory	hate	investment	good	end	low	one	old	machine	electric			a waste of money from a company that knows better . i love my mixer this is my second kitchenaid ; i upgraded from the low end model and gave my mom the old one ! but i hate this accessory . i already had the meat grinder and figured that since we like pasta so much this would be a good investment . wrong ! it simply doesn not work . all the strands of pasta stick together as they come out of the holes , even when using the recommended / included recipe . save your money and buy a hand cranked fettuccine maker , or splurge and get a dedicated electric pasta machine .
2			activities	high	bit	little	sports	good			good sports bra for the price . i have used this bra for several years . they are well constructed for the price point and i find them well supportive for high impact activities . because i am bigger now after having kids went from a 36 to 38 / d , i find a little bit of a uniboob problem than before kids .
2			price	reasonable	memories	great	series	classic			classic . this bought back great memories of childhood , classic series and well packaged with bonus features at a reasonable price .
1			skill	great	number	laughable			genius ? as has already been pointed out by other reviewers , the numbers here just don not add up . a win rate anythingclose to what they boast should give a far greateroverall return . boast being the operative word bythe way . the number of times we are told how smartthese people are is laughable . let's examine the evidencefor this genius . they counted cards . so what ? anyonecan learn to do this in a few hours . this was inventedover thirty years ago . they played in tea ms again , a lot of people have done this . i believe this was alsodone in the seventies . they got caught . not evidenceof great skill there . in fact , if they were not mitkids there would be absolutely zero evidence of any intelligenceabove average . seems like a case of a few college kids who happenedto know the author .
2			product	great	price	unbelievable	price	great			great product at a great price . bought this cable for an unbelievable price and it works perfectly with my mac mini hooked to my hk home receiver .
2			songs	great			an epic . entangled , would ance on a volcano and ripples are great songs . mad man moon is an epic . why can not tony banks write like this anymore ?
1			opening	big	product	good	cleaning	easy	reviews	good			can you get your hand in the carafe to clean it ? i can not ! what are the people who design this stuff thinking ? i don not want to put in some cleaner and wait and pour it out , i want to scrub my coffee pot . i bought it after reading so many good reviews on it what are the people who review this stuff thinking ? took it out of the box , saw the flaw with the carafe , and thanks to amazon , am immediately sending it back . oh , and the quality ? incredible , it is lightweight enough to be made out of papier mch . is it ? so , on goes my quest for a decent coffee maker . one that is apparently glass with a big opening for easy cleaning , quality no object since they are mostly all junk today , probably a mr coffee since a higher price doesn not guarantee a really good product , one that permits a permanent filter since i don not do paper filters , and , most of all , one that doesn not require water filters . what a scam , the requirement of water well , welcome to this century . what a world .
2			story	great			great story . simple , funny , all together great read if you have spare time . if you are a fan of alice hoffman you won not be disappointed with this novel .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			beautiful , simply beautiful . perfectly cast and well acted . this a very touching movie without being sappy .
2			story	great			love it . i love this author . he is an awesome author , his work rocks . this was a great story . will reccomend highly
2			book	good	thing	negative	story	great	parts	slow	it	entertaining	thing	slow			over all the book was good , but some parts were slow . the book had a great story behind it and it was told well for the most part . the only thing i could say that was negative about it was some parts were slow . it was mostly a book for the twelve and older range , but for the most part , it was entertaining .
2			hundred	extra	looked	flawless			100 satisfied . now . i bought the unit , got it home , and played some movies through my hdmi hookup . it looked flawless , even better than how the store demo unit looked . by comparison to seeing blu ray in action , hd dvd completely blows it away . unfortunately , the player i bought had a glitch that caused the hdmi port to fail . returned and exchanged it , and my second unit works flawlessly . i have had a couple of the lockup problems , although none ever during playback . its just a matter of turning off , unplugging , then replugging and turning the unit on again . i guess thats the price to pay for such wonderful technology as an early adopter , but i wouldn not give this thing up at all . it works wonderfully as an upscaling dvd player . if you are considering an upscaling dvd player , just spend the extra few hundred and buy this . you won not be sorry .
2			cd	best			a wise man once said . i think there's something strangely musical about noise . well , i have to say that there is something strangely musical about trent reznor that makes nine inch nails one of my favorite bands . pretty hate machine is by far the best nails cd ever to be released ! however , if you have only heard stuff off of the downward spiral , broken or the fragile , you might want to concider listening to the cd first before buying it , cause no nin album is alike .
1			books	worst	this	hate	it	bad	blood	suck	story	real			soooooo bad ! i had read all the other books about alex cross and liked every one of them . then along came violets are blue . it is the one of the worst books i have tried to read . i quit after 125 pages . i just gave up . person after person is killed and the blood sucked out of them . all done by vampires no less . it is so bad . no real story except alex trying to catch them . just killing after killing . i really hate this . i liked james patterson so much . i don not know if i will ever buy another one or not , wish i had not bought this one .
1			character	main	flits	main			yawn if you need to fall asleep . the beginning of the book leads you to believe it will hold your attention and interest , but rapidly fails on all fronts . the relationships are superficial at be st i learned more about gardening in a drought than i care to know and the fact that the main character knows more arsenists than the fbi is main character flits around her life through most of the book , then to wrap it all up , the action quickly takes place in the last couple chapters . save your money for another book . boo !
1			wages	poor	race	current	states	united	book	definitive	health	real			more bs from a wanna be . who could nt take it . after reading this book and surviving 29 years in the trucking industry i am greatly inclined to agree with mr pendergast's points of view . too much is wasted on trying to fit in with a lifestyle that needs to change , not be adjusted to . sweatshops on wheels was the definitive book on the current race to the bottom of the trucking industry . want poor wages when you add up your total time put in and no life ? no real health benefeits or pension if your non union ? then by all means come join us in the trucking industry and completely throw your life away . everyone talks about doing something to help the driver , but as usual nothing is ever done . truck drivers are still the only labor group in the united states not covered by the fair labor standards act . and this book still does nt address that .
1			copy	personal			this may not be what you remember . we have tried 2 videos from this site looking for a personal copy of a program we saw on tv in 1995 this has been scrubbed for g and does not include the funny dialoge we were expecting .
1			ravioli	fresh	dishes	new	sites	similar	recipes	good	it	annoying			dissapointing . the book came from amazon took almost a month which is far too long compared to similar sites , the sleeve was dirty and looked like it had been sitting in a warehouse dusty corner for years , that wasn not the disappointing part the book has no images just recipes , for an amateur cook it's very annoying and hard especially for new dishes i have never tried . probably wouldn not recommend it but there are a few good recipes such as fresh ravioli etc
2			book	little	affection	amazing			wolfling review . this is a gorgeous little book for lovers of wolves . yes it is an older book but the affection between the boy and the wolf is amazing and will touch the heart of animal lovers .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			fan . my husband got me to watch the series and i bought this for him for part of his birthday present . i really enjoyed the series and thought that he would like this . we have not finished the dvd , but it's been great watching it !
2			it	adjustable	seats	cheap			a little pricey but well worth it . now i know why the cheap potty seats are so cheap . wish i has been able to see this side by side with the cheap ones . if i had this would have been the one i would have bought . this potty seat is well designed , doesn not rock , and is one piece . it's adjustable and easily fits the toilet at my son's house and the one at my house . my granddaughter wouldn not sit one the cheap one bought originally but really likes this one . dry days are coming soon , wish they had these when my kids were at this stage .
2			i	disappointed no			if you value your finger nails , don not read this book . i had never read lisa gardner before , so i had no idea what to expect . i was not disappointed . it had me on the edge of my seat from the very first chapter . i read the third victim in one seating , and immediately logged on to amazon to buy all of her books . this book doesn not pull its punches , it has you gripped until the last page , and leaves you deflated when you have finished . not for the faint hearted !
1			one	old			cclimate control . i had 2 climate controller ship to me for a 03 envoy when you put it on cool you get heat when on heat you get cool i put my old one back in works fine only the led light don not work on one side .
2			understanding	basic	chapters	dull	review	critical	understanding	technical	literature	confusing	understanding	legal			excellent critical review of progress under cwa . cwa literature is overwhelming , dense , and confusing . this book is a refreshing change the progress under the clean water act is presented in a very simple manner . good for basic technical and legal understanding of the subject . epa and state level programs and reports are brilliantly critiqued no wonder , the book is produced by nrdc ! the text is supported by excellent research of legislative history of the chapter 2 out of 8 chapters is a little dull . in chapter 2 the figures could have been more illustrative , and the discussion of numbers could have been livelier . overall , the most interesting and understandable book on cwa .
2			struggles	serious	thing	good	journals	best			one of the best gratitude journals i have found . even when faced with serious struggles , i like to say to myself , the good thing about this is . simple abundance offers gentle reminders that there is always something to be thankful for . keep it by your bed for sweeter drea ms
2			message	deep			get this book ! mark spitzer is genius . chum's message is deep and hidden under a steaming pile of bile and goo ; and he forces you to dig through it to find it . this is the most skillful writing of any author living . kudos mr spitzer , my chum , my chummy chummy chum .
1			quality	terrible	concept	great			terrible quality . great concept , absolutely painful execution . i get accounts that subtract when they are supposed to add until you close and restart the program , downloaded transactions between accounts that don not connect , screen flicker as the program refreshes for over a minute , the list goes on . and the bottom line is the numbers don not add up , especially on my investments . some of the errors amount to 50 of the account value . it's rediculous . i hear ms money isn not much better , so you are probably better off not buying either unless you really want to spend a lot of time on this to generate pretty graphs .
2			son	old	i	proud	i	happy			superb . i love it and so does my 3 year old son . i bought him a karoke machine for christmas so we could sing it . on the way to work / school every morning we sing i love you baby . i m proud of lauryn and happy for her . keep up the superb work . it was always something about her that i knew she would be a success .
2			it	effective no	watch	original	bang	great			best bang for the buck ! i originally bought one of these many years ago for work and it performed very well considering the type of work i do . paid about $ 10 or $ 11.00 for it and after about 3 years the band broke . since it's not cost effective to replace the band on a $ 10 watch , i simply bought another one for around $ 13.00 a couple of years ago . the 2 d watch and band are still going strong . since i like the watch so much , i just ordered a 3 d one on amazon to be sure i have it if / when the 2 d watch or band good timestopwatch functionwater resistantlong battery life i still have the original watch with the broken band and it's still running cons cheap band but hey , it's a $ 15.00 watch alarm is too quietall in all , this watch offers great bang for the buck ! i recommend it .
2			i	glad	section	final	book	good			good , but . i have loved andrei codrescu's nonfiction for many years , and am always pleased to hear him on is the first work of fiction by him that i have read . casanova in bohemia is a fascinating book . i liked , and was grateful for codrescu's obvious and careful research . i have always thought there was more to casanova , but was not compelled to do my own characters are well drawn , particularly laura , casanova's maid and muse , and the settings are one objection is to the final section of this good book . i did not find the last section of the book , a time travel episode , to be very me , it rang a little hollow . i am glad i read this book , however .
1			history	bad			disappointing . the author fails to see things with the eyes of the generation about which he is writing . that makes for bad history , merely the out of context attachment of situations , strung together into a book . how disappointing . however , he cannot be very lonesome . i m afraid he has the company of a lot of clever , educated , useless historians so called these days .
2			it	hard			wonderful ! this book shows the way the family lived and what types of people they were . at times it is hard to keep all of the people straight , but there are footnotes and a family tree which 's along book , but don not let it's length stop you from getting it you will love to read it !
1			maker	great	popcorn	delicious			broke after 8 times of use ! this popcorn maker was great the first 8 times we used it . the popcorn was delicious . unfortunately , the heating element broke off in the base and is no longer working . what a bummer . do not buy this popper !
2			none	superior	album	bad			bad , you know it . supreme ! ! i always thought that the bad album and tour was his stamp as a solo artist , when you look at other artist at that time and today , michael is superior bar none . who's badd !
2			one	bad	cd	great			a groovy cd all have got to have this ! it's koo ! unlike most cds this cd does not have one bad 's a great cd , packed with intersting songs that really make you only do you relate to the music this is music you can feel , get into , when you listen to it . i hope that they come out with another cd soon that's just as is a must matter what kind of music you like you will like this cd . i was unsure of it when i got it because i m into switchblade symphony and groups like that but i really love joydrop .
2			novel	great	invasion	scary	story	great	book	great			wells wrote one heck of a book . wells wrote a great story that has been redone so many times now . it wasn not written in the 50 s as many people might think . it was actually written in the 1890 s . and wells creates a story about alien invasion that is so scary and well put together . it has martian's coming to corral the humans . and the humans at first have no way to beat them . they keep getting beat and it almost seems as if we are going to be killed at any moment only for the humans to come out on top . a great victorian style novel that stands the test of time a la independence day . though this book is ten times better than independence day . a great sci fi book that will forever be the blueprint for alien invasion novels or movies .
1			carb	low	store	local	recipies	best	foods	low			not very useful for anyone on the go . i found the informaton in this book to be helpful for a low carb diet , but most of it is already covered in the low carb diet book that got you started . the recipies are best for someone with a lot of time to shop for the specialized ingredients and then to prepare the meal . and if you are expecting that with 500 recipes there must be some winners which i thought , you need to know that most of the recipes are merely variations on a single recipe . this may be helpful since each provides the actual carb counts , but i could have figured out the difference with any carb counting i add in the value of my time , i found it more cost effective to purchase the prepared low carb foods in my local health food store . when i cook , i stick to the simple recipes in the diet book .
1			book	awful	it	hate			this book was awful . this book makes absolutely no sense at all . i read the first page and i didn not like it . i have to read it for school and i have fallen asleep 4 times reading it . all of my friends hate it to . we have a test on the 2 d day of 8 h grade . even using the cliffs notes didn not help at all . i don not recommend this book to anyone .
2			ingredients	additional	i	creative	mix	great			no msg . i try to be creative and add additional ingredients and seasoning to personalize the soup . having said that , this is a great soup mix . i was concerned about msg , and asked the company in hearty bean soup mix , one of the ingredients is hydrolyzed vegetable protein . is this msg ? their response if msg is in one of our products it is listed as msg in the ingredient li st we do not disguise it in other ingredients . please look at the health corner . of our website where we have a list of many of our products that do not have msg .
1			i	disappointed	librarian	italian	references	literary	flame	mysterious	references	cultural			the mysterious flame of queen loana . as an eco fan , i could not wait to read his latest novel . sadly , i was deeply disappointed by this pompous , self indulgent , virtually unreadable monster . the cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70 something italian librarian .
1			case	original	weakness	common	reviewers	previous	use	normal			my clip broke too . like a couple of the previous reviewers , the clip on my original case broke within a month or two of normal use too . luckily i was sitting on the train when it snapped rather than walking down the street , so no damage was done to the case works fine otherwise , but now it's carried in my coat pocket or in my messenger bag . i wouldn not buy another one of this design now that i see that the clip seems to be a common weakness .
2			it	worth	numbers	cool	numbers	musical			fun stuff still holds up well . this is a fun movie and the musical numbers are pretty cool . it's worth it . stockard channing's rizzo is a standout .
1			information	wrong	book	pretty	books	new	book	worst	amount	small			inaccurate garbage . i would give this book a zero star rating if it was possible . as a professor of music technology , new books cross my desk constantly . this is hands down the worst music technology book i have ever seen . it is chock full of inaccuracies and is written in the style of a freshman term paper . the majority of the book is devoted to simple audio recording a rehash of gibson's other books . there is a small amount of information dealing with sample editing which is the one saving grace of the book . the midi information is simply wrong . finally , there is far too much filler writing about how gibson dislikes hardware samplers but loves macs , steely dan , and toto . the book is pretty , though .
1			book	fine	imprecise	poor	translation	bad	stories	basic			bad translation . sure , this kindle version may include all of the stories written by andersen , but the translation is poor and imprecise , which i felt detracted too much from the stories themselves . if you want to know the basic stories , then this book is fine , but if you want to enjoy well worded story telling , this is definitely not the version for you . for those who enjoy a beautiful telling , i suggest purchasing one of the better translated , illustrated kindle versions .
2			i	pleased			wood owl self feed bit . the company sent the product in a very timely manner . i was very pleased with them .
2			thing	medical	it	new	it	great	shape	great	she	excited	thing	little			great shape . i gave this series to my sister for christmas and she was so excited ! she loved that it came in a cute little medical chart thing . it was brand new , no scratches , never opened . it's great
1			character	main	authors	repetitive	on	dead	character	stupid	book	good			this is a good book . another beautiful lie . i listened to this book on cd , it was probably the most mind numbing ten hours of my life . this book had an interesting premise but the execution left me wanting to scream . the main character ridley was so stupid and insipid a character that i actually lost my patience . i really hate when authors are repetitive to the point of annoyance , this is one of those cases . not only is ridley the saddest character i have run across in a long time , not because of her situation but because of the way that her character comes across . if i were to meet here , she would get on my nerves inside of five minutes , the conversations just drag on forever . the conclusion of this book was watery and there was no ah ha moment , just more vague conversations . i wouldn not recommend this book to anyone , it was recommended to me by because of my book purchases . most of the time , its dead on , this book was a disappointment , big time !
1			recommendation	negative			disappointed . i ordered this item despite the negative recommendation written by other users assuming that i will get the item no matter what . i requested it one month before the exam day , but 5 days left & still i didn not get the item neither an update from the seller ! so i contacted the seller where he advised that it is a tracking system issue & will be solved within a week or so ! which means , exam is already over ! so i asked for refund & recall the item back . two days later i got the refund ! i hoped the processing speed for sending the item was as much as refuning itself !
2			range	open	enemy	common	guys	bad			open range . stunning ! ! look past the actual plot of the movie of cowboys and cows and bad guys and greed and you will see a deeply profound story of relationships , of longing to belong , of sacrificial love of intimacy longed for but afraid to step out and say something , until a common enemy and a noble cause bring down all pretenses you expose the yearn in your heart ! ! must see movie ! !
1			opposite	complete	i	satisfied no	condition	horrible			cengage advantage books sociology paperback . the book was in horrible condition . there was writing and highlighting absolutely everywhere . the front cover and book seemed very mistreated . for the description that was given about i feel like it showed the complete opposite . i was not very satisfied with that purchase .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			excellent . product was recommended by my eye doctor . i really have no way of knowing if it is helping , but will continue taking it as long as my doctor recommends it .
1			types	interesting			disappointing . i personally didn not enjoy this book . it's printed on cheap paper , and it doesn not contain any photographs or illustrations , except for a few line art pictures for decoration only . the bulk of the book describes 24 types of book could be interesting for people who are in a romantic relationship who would enjoy reading about and trying out some different kissing techniques described .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			misleading . this video does not qualify as a fitness video . it did not have enough information to even begin . would not recommed it to anyone that want's a to pole dance as a fitness program .
2			one	best	stories	smart	writers	great	books	best	turn	big	ideas	new			the best for couples . i have read a lot of best erotica books and this one is really top notch . it's the best one for couples and way better than most of the women's erotica out there . there are some really great writers in sweet life . the stories are really smart and a big turn on for both of us , and have given us a lot of new ideas .

1			character	main	courses	reasonable	ending	awful	circumstances	similar	story	entire	it	worth no	sense	awful			not worth watching . this movie just does not deliever . the story makes no sense and the ending is just awful . the children do not act like any children would act under similar circumstances . the adults don not either . when given reasonable courses of action the character played by ms kerr rejects them in favor of outlandish actions . as the person with some rationality in theory and control ms kerr's character acts very irrational and as someone without wife believes the main adult character played by ms kerr is nuts to start with , and that may explain the rest of the film because the entire story is told from her point of view . but that isn not made clear at any point . and if she was irrational to start with it isn not brought out . if she becomes irrational during the movie it isn not clear what might have brought on the breakdown . i do not recommend this film . it is not worth watching .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			ann marlowes heroin book . ive read this book , but more importantly lived this craziness and will attest to the accuracy of her observations . as i read some of the passages i could actually taste the taste and started to sniffle , my nose began to run . it scared the hell out of me . i wish i could say that life style was behind me , but anyone who has done heroin will admit you never stop wanting it , that you sometimes still dream about it , and know intimately the situations you put yourself in . jim michaels
1			t	complete			shindig presents british invasion part 2 vhs . just like the first part of this british invasion series , the 30 minute running time for this vhs is not worth the price . this video is fit for the archives alone and not for viewing enjoyment . i highly recommend the hullabaloo dvd collection series instead which presents complete t . v . shows and has a running time of almost 5 hours which is worth the price of this dvd .
2			story	believable	heroine	serious			lush setting , action story sets up romance . gillian is summoned by the man who murdered her father when she was a child to determine the location of a stolen treasure . as she tries to find a long lost sister who may have the treasure , gillian turns to scottish chieftain brodick . as he tries to help her find the treasure and save her uncle , she unwittingly marries brodick , who has decided he will simply take what he wants , a tradition of his people that does not sit well with english born gillian . his strength and bravery win her over , however , as the two take on all of england to clear her father's name and restore her family's is a well spun tale . although the highlanders are a little edgy and rough , and gillian keeps changing from flimsy damsel in distress to fighting , serious wound enduring heroine , i liked the pair and their many cohorts . not a believable story in many respects , but an entertaining one .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			sorry i wasted my money . instead of buying this book all you have to do is read the summary and you will have the whole idea . he uses about 1000 words for every one that he needs , just to state the obvious , over and over .

1			quality	poor	camera	new			poor quality and even worse support . skip this camera and focus on a different manufacturer . we bought this camera as a christmas present , and less than 4 weeks after it was opened , the camera was broken the lense was stuck . we were informed by sony that since they didn not have any parts for the camera , we had to either take a refund , or a refurbished model . even though we bought a new camera , we now have to accept a refurb since you can not even buy this camera for the same price anymore .

1			sync	active			too good to be true . i was looking for compatibility with certain win ce tells you nowhere that it has its own casio proprietary customized operating system , that does not allow running active sync which is the interface between your pc and this dumb pda instead it has a program called pc connect and very few programs have been written for it . very dissapointing and deceiving
1			mountaineering	real			not for mountaineers . if you like to read about real mountaineering , try a book by joe simpson or jon krakauer . if you want to read a book about a guy who blows off his family to climb , and all the damage he does because of it , then this book is ideal for you . i was hoping to read a survival story , instead i got family dynamics .

1			series	new	season	amazing	doctor	new	one	new			i tried ! terrible . can not take this new doctor . have been a fan for years and always found it difficult when a new doctor i liked left and a new one appeared . but i always ended up liking the new doctor and stayed a fan since the tom baker years . the new series i thought would never work but to my surprise the first season was amazing . then i see christopher eccleston is leaving the series and david tennant is taking over as the new doctor . my first thought was what a dumb move they will never find a new doctor like chris eccleston . but to my amazement they found an even better doctor in david . i even loved billie piper and hated to see her leave . but this third doctor is pure torment to watch . i have tried , i honestly have tried , and it saddens me there is no possible way into tricking me into liking this new doctor . horrible and terrible ! ! should have ended the series after season four .

2			me	mad	draft	original	series	best	it	good	it	excellent	risk	great	characters	new	story	new			the prequel to the best series of games . when i first heard about this movie i thought heck yeah , this is gonna take right off the games and when i heard george romero was writing the script i was enthrilled even more . i later found out that he was fired and his script would be scrapped , that really made me mad especially after reading romero's original draft for the movie . i found out they were going to have a new story with new characters and only 3 monsters the zombies , howlers , and licker . i got back into it because i found out this was going to be a prequel to the games giving them a back story . i downloaded it first off the internet to see if it was truly good and it was . then i saw it in theatres . it was excellent , it suprised that the guy who did mortal kombat anihilation did this film . this film was really a one of a kind deal and a great risk because it didn not follow the games but it followed through . i will buy the dvd , you should too .

1			it	bad	thing	due			oh , my . so incredibly bad it's bad . this movie has to fall into the catagory of a dog with no legs or tail . my wife has a crush on jake gyllenhaal is my only defense for sitting through the whole thing which was hard enough due to the fact that the film acctually produces anti laughter . the 1 star is for a flick actually having a character named dr phreak .

2			corman	important	performance	finest	shatner	best	issue	tough	it	worth	series	classic			shatner's best . i came upon this film by chance on tv , and was stunned by how well it was executed . not only does this deal with a tough issue on racism , it portrays two sides of a coin . i don not want to give away the plot , but it is well worth checking out . arguably the most important film roger corman has attempted . i think he succeeded . i am also a lifelong trek fan , and as much as i admire shatner's performances in trek ii and classic series , i believe this to be his finest performance . nuff said .

1			it	hate	it	simple	bitching	hate	book	hate	character	hate			love it or hate it . essentially this is a character novel , if you like the character you love the book , if you hate the character you hate the book . it's as simple as that , there are no other characters besides holden , no plot besides his narrations which are a series of complaints . i hated holden and his obnoxious bitching over everything that happens to him . the book is basically a review of the things he finds most annoying in life and his complaints on them . it gets really tiring after only one chapter , not to mention the annoyance of his comments after making an observation , such as honestly , i m not lying , i swear i m not this really happened this phrase or something like it are once a page . the novel is a love it or hate it novel depending on whether you love or hate holden and i found him one of the most obnoxious characters in literature .
1			gift	true	example	great			hemingway good , story bad . i have often wondered how i got through college as an english major without reading any hemingway . the classics have always been my favorites , and american lit specifically . so , as an adult , i have tried to add some of those critically acclaimed books i missed in undergrad to my have read li st the first hemingway book i read post college was a farewell to ar ms i liked it . not loved , but liked it enough to read more of his work . but this one . i struggled through it . i felt like each page was the same group of friends who don not all like each other and lots and lots of alcohol . i did make it to the end despite my minimal interest in the story or lack there of because , no matter what the story is , ernest hemingway's style of writing is a great example of a true gift .

2			tracks	new	it	great			falkenbach returns with more of the viking / folk / epic metal they have been known for throughout the years and once again they fail to disappoint . the album begins with heathen foray , a song i swear i heard on their 1998 album magni blandinn ok megintiri . but it seems to have been given a reworked touch here . the same applies to song 6 laeknishendr . if i m keeping count correctly , this is the 3 d time this song gets re recorded . the rest of the compositions show the majesty of clean vocals if used the right way , along with choir chanting , giving an aura of mental landscapes viking era bathory like in the song heralder . new tracks like walkiesjar and of forest unknown display a degree of freshness and epicness . overall , it's great to see this band hasn not lost its style and keeps producing majestic metal that lasts for ages .

1			things	important			helped very little . i was expecting this book to help my playing , but it helped very little . it seemed like i was reading more than even touching the pianumber the book is a ok referance book , but didn not explain some of the important things in enough detail . so it really wasn not what i was looking for in a self teaching book .
1			it	hate	gorilla	annoying	gorilla	cute	scientists	complete	story	basic	it	scary no	sphere	fantastic	it	difficult			seen the movie ? hated it ? here's why . i actually wondered whether this was the same writer who gave us the fantastic sphere and jurassic park . congo is really something better left to airport bookstores . the basic story is that a group of scientists complete with an intelligent ape which can sign , travels to the congo to investigate odd goings on . at least , that's what we are lead to believe . instead , the plot meanders around , often going into completely irrelevent sections on computer programming and terrorist activity which has nothing whatsoever to do with the story . the gorilla , amy , is actually quite annoying rather than cute and the whole idea is a bit unlikely . finally we meet the nemesis of the congo and then everything falls flat . it's not particularly scary and to be honest , it's difficult to care about the characters . the movie didn not do much for this book , granted , but to be honest , it couldn not have made it worse .

1			set	worst	i	disappointed	product	poor	colby	ashamed	headphones	cheap			not worth the cost of its plastic packaging . worst set of headphones i have ever used . i wasn not expecting much considdering the cost of the item , even so i was extremely dissapointed . i know colby headphones are cheap in comparison with other brands , but this model is seriously lacking in quality even by their standards . the highs almost werent there , sounded like the top of the frequency responce cuts off at about 9000 -10000 hertz , the description says they have deep bass , nothing could be further from the truth , i have used ear buds even colby ones ! that had 10 times the bass responce . colby should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a poor product on the market ! since the price was so low i did not bother sending them back for a refund , i simply threw them out with the trash , it seemed an appropriate place for them .

1			i	surprised	reviews	good	shots	decent			slow and ineffectual . this might be one of the slowest moving movies i have ever seen . the plot really only takes place in about the last 30 -45 in . then when it does , it doesn not go very far . i m really surprised at the number of good reviews of it . i gave it 2 stars since there were a couple action shots that were decent and it did have a halfway decent ending . although , that could have been my joy it was over .

1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			manufacturing problem ? like quite a few others i received this set with the primary 1 t disc being in fact a duplicate of the 5 h disc which is just a workcut of the film . amazon quickly sent me a replacement . but that set has the same issue . disc one has different and correct artwork so it appears the manufacturer had some issues when they printed these discs and there are a glut of them out there . i sent amazon another e mail to see how to proceed and don not know how that will go since they apparently won not do a refund for this order and a third replacement seems likely to offer the same proble ms but buyer beware if you are planning to pick this set up through amazon right now . not sure if other retailers are having the same issue also .
1			anchors	normal	side	fine	pack	fresh			don not believe their load rating . i used these for the first time today thinking they would save time , and be a neater solution to the wall anchors . however , it turned out to be four times the work , and a lot of frustration . i was hanging curtains in the living room . i ran out of my normal wall anchors and had a fresh pack of the 50 lb wall dogs . i used two in one holder a total of 100 b support , then hung my curtain . the side with the wall dogs was sagging . it was nearly all the way out ! the side without only 40 b rating per anchor the wall dogs was just fine ! i had to remove them , but that had weakened the drywall , so i had to go to the store to buy even bigger anchors to put in the two gaping holes the wall dogs had created . i will never buy these again . you have been warned .
1			characters	sick	characters	boring			look elsewhere . i can not believe i wasted not only my hard earned money , but my precious time watching this many people have referred to it as brilliant , funny , and artistic . it is none of the above . the characters in this movie are sad , boring , lonely , sick , and perverted . i made the mistake of pausing the movie on many occasions just to get a break from it . unfortunately , that only made the movie seem three times longer than it really was . please don not make the same mistake i did by buying / watching this mess .
1			leak	free	boy	little	one	little			bothered baby skin . i usually love pampers , but the baby dry pampers really irritated my little boy's skin . he didn not have any leaks but the angry red marks on his skin negated the leak free aspect . if your baby's skin isn not super sensitive , these would be great but if your little one has sensitive skin , skip these and go for the swaddlers .

1			part	important	reviews	good	book	general	me	crazy			not very well organized . despite some of the good reviews , this book drove me crazy ! it does not sound like it was written specifically for the inet exam which is what i was expecting . this is more of a general internet book that missed the mark on the inet te st i took and passed the test though , but after having read further material specific to the exam . i really wonder if the authors even took the exam , because that should explain why some things where covered that were out in left field and why some things werent covered out all or skimmed over that were an important part of my exam .
1			it	odd	books	good	end	hate	it	realistic no	it	cool			the giver . . a weird book . can you imagine living in a world where there are no memories or feelings ? this book written by lois lowry , was alright until the ending . it was pretty cool how you found out that these people are color blind but it was totally unrealistic . there were many surprises that i didn not expect to happen but it was kind of odd that the community didn not even know what pain or love was . i personaly hated the end of the book because they left many things unanswered like what happened to the giver , what happened to the community , and what happened to jonas and gabriel . i would recommend this book to someone who likes wierd books but not to someone who likes good books like me .

1			sense	common	white	little	knowledge	elementary	age	new			schnoebelen's little white lie . this book and its author lack any creditability . anyone with even an elementary knowledge of wicca and the new age can easily tell that my schnoebelen has no idea what he is talking about . if you want to learn about wicca read a book written by a wiccan . its only common sense . one wouldnt expect to read a book about christianity written by a wiccan author . the same is true for this .
1			one	worst	e	free	script	heavy			incompetent proofreading in the kindle edition . it's understandable that free e books from the 19 h century would have a few typos , but this is ridiculous . when you are charging money for an e book , you have a responsibility to make an effort at accuracy . some of the chapter headings in w&r were originally printed in fraktur heavy germanic script . the worst one i saw was zrandator o aoreworb , which was supposed to be translator's foreword

1			product	poor			very poor product . i installed this myself using the incredibly lacking instructions . i tried tech support but they refused to tell me anything , saying instead that he could not help me until i researched installation procedures and terminology . it worked for a few days and then suddenly quit working the next time i tried to burn a cd . the troubleshooting manual said that it may stop functioning if you have more than one burning software on your computer . i had windows media player and quicktime installed when i used the included nero burning software successfully several times . after it quit i uninstalled all burning software and only reinstalled nero but in continued to not function and i even took the actual drive out and reinstalled it but that did not work either . tech support is incredibly awefull , save yourself the trouble and by a respected brand of equipment .
1			ones	hate	taste	good			sticks to your teeth ! there are lots of choices in fruit snacks and thought i would give this a try . well , these stick to your teeth when you are eating them . they taste good but not as real tasting as the others like minute maid . if you are like me that hates the ones that stick , then avoid these ! what am i going to do with the 99 pouches i have left ?
1			movie	worst	film	expensive			one of the worst movie endings ever , i . just like most french movies , it just ends , there is no ending , not even a wind down . i guess film was expensive back in those days .
1			movie	good	sound	bad			buy cheap buy twice ! the movie rocks . the dvd does not . the sound is bad and in some parts of the movie the heads are cut off ! its like one of those movies you down load that have been taped in a cinema ! honestly this movie is so good it deserves a better viewing than the one this cheap dvd offers . i have learned my lesson ! !
1			design	old	cuts	short	port	common	style	old	version	old			cheap replacement but not really a replacement . i bought these to replace my 2 way fuel valves in my 1966 -1977 early ford bronco . first , these valves are cheap chinese versions of an old american design that you can still buy through parker hanfin . i only learned this after i bought them . second these valves do not replace the old style american valves because the common port should come out the bottom not on the side as these are . third on the old american version the handle turns 180 deg to switch tank feeds . these do not they only turn 90 deg . fourth the chinese design took some short cuts and the parts are not interchangeable so that means what i bought is useless to recommended if you want a quality replacement for an old american design that you can still buy from an american manufacturer .
1			eaters	good			works , hard to make your pets take it . i have a maltese and a malti poo , they are normally good eaters . althought after a few days , they refused to drink the water bowl that contained angel eyes . we tried to put it in their food , but that failed as well . we gave these to a friend and had the same results .
1			it	fresh	price	typical	section	difficult			dont buy this pocket knife trader's price guide volume 8 . well its a typical price guide . the values in it are way overinflated and none of the knives actually bring that much money . it is also missing prices for several highly collectible case xx section of this book is kinda difficult to find what you are looking you are thinking of buying this book then dont , i would recommend pocket knife trader's price guide volume 8 it is much easier to figure out and has actual prices and it is cheaper . it is also fresh off the presses and is written by a group of people who are directly involved with case and tony foster who knows everything about knives .
1			satire	political	satire	dead			cinematic satire is dead . tom lehrer once said that political satire died the day henry kissinger was given the nobel peace prize . thus it is with cinematic satire as this film won the oscar for best adapted screenplay . there is no story of any worth here . it adds nothing to our understanding of the human condition which other reviewers seem to imply is where its value lies per se , it is merely a series of sketches in search of a coherent theme which fails qua entertainment . mckellan and redgrave do their best , but with such prosaic material to work off they cannot save a very boring film whose raison d etre escapes the ever increasing somnolent viewer . that it won an oscar for the screenplay says far more about the academy's often appalling decisions than anything else . perhaps , like the american presidency , lobby money can buy anything .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			should be presented unabridged ! to much is left out in the abridged . it really needs to be presented in unabridged . i have been told by publishers that will not happen because the people that have the rights will not release them . that is not right to those of use who a wait the unabridged story .
1			i	disappointed	breadman	new	setting	free	i	excited			impossible . i was excited to use my new breadman for the first time because of the gluten free setting . i was really disappointed when i couldn not remove the bread pan from the machine . it was impossible to get it out . needless to say , we repackaged the breadman and are shipping it back today !
1			reviews	previous			mine broke also ! ! ! as stated by the previous two reviews , mine broke and lowe's nor home depot have them in stock so now i have to pay extra for shipping ! ! now , i know to put twice as many as they recommend . i will be putting twice as many as before . take note and add extras before your's break !
1			film	worst	shakes	great	waste	complete	fan	huge	film	horrible			i would rather watch an episode of voyager ! i am a huge star trek fan , and this is the worst star trek film ever , i promise . as i said in the title of my review , i would rather suffer through a first season episode of voyager than watch this tripe again . horribly written , with zero regard for continuity or the consistency of characters , this ranks as a horrible film in all aspects . i like insurrection a thousand times more than this film , and insurrection was no great shakes . avoid this film , it's a complete waste of time . i guarantee !
1			situation	current	i	disappointed	none	likeable	shape	bad			just awful . in the middle of a festival of gay themed movies read downbheat and depressing i looked forward to this offering for some light relief and humor . i was totally disappointed on all counts . none of the characters are likeable and if it is a study of humanity , both gay and straight , then the world is in pretty bad shape . the film portrayed most characters as mercurial , unstable and morally could have been a movie relevant to the current situation of gay marriage turned out to be a lesson on why most people are skeptical of the relevance of such unions .
1			tryin	rich	massacre	suck	sales	great	album	great	music	great	album	good	ludacris	weak	sellout	biggest	machine	huge	album	crappy			the massacre sucks ass . don not waste your time on this crappy album . the massacre is selling units simply because of the huge hype machine that is the biggest sellout in the history of rap 50 rich or die tryin was a really good album and 50 is a decent rapper . my problem with him is that he is such a shameless sellout who cares only about making money , not about making great album is very weak , but like ludacris , fat joe , nelly and all the other sellouts who are contaminating rap these days , 50 knows he does not have to make great music to have great record sales . do yourself a favor and save your money for ready to die , life after death , or one of pac's albu ms the massacre is trash .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			really brief . the reason why people buy official strategy guides in the first place is because they need in depth guide book is really brief hardly telling you where key items are and how to defeat bosses and the right team combinations and skills to use . legend of dragoon is a complicated game and the guide book does not help by briefly describing on the dragoon power , how to boost it up could have been better
1			software	horrible	i	disappointed	i	anxious			5 tars for celine , -5 for sony . i love celine's music , but i was so disappointed to discover that this is yet another victim of sony's virus promoting software xcp . i am anxious to play and ripp this on my pc , but because of sony's root kit software , i dare not risk it . for all celine fans , i suggest you make your voice heard too . sony's decision to install this software without your knowledge , hide it and make it difficult if not impossible to remove , is unethical and probably illegal such as in california . hopefully , celine & other artists who are victims of sony's actions will be able to put preasure on sony to release a clean cd devoid of this horrible software .
1			day	similar	it	good	service	terrible	people	satisfied no	cd	fine	critic	hard no			ok lessons / terrible delivery service . the lessons taught on these pimsleur cd's are fine , but the delivery time was completely unacceptable . i will never buy any such item online again . why would i ? it took nearly 4 weeks to deliver an item i could have gone to barnes and noble and had certainly similar same day . this is the reason people are dissatisfied with online purchases . service when it is good the expectation is for a 5 star review . i am not a hard critic , but i do know what 5 star service is and it was not associated with this purchase .
1			i	wrong			things that make you say hmmm . i bought this album hoping she would finally get the hint that listeners want some jumpy , dance music , but was i ever wrong . she has 3 tracks on the cd that i enjoy , and using the word enjoy is pushing it . she needs to take her music to another level , and i am thinking after her last 2 cd's that level might singing .
1			person	best no	characters	interesting no			boring and confusing . i found this to be slow moving , confusing and boring . the characters were uninteresting and the book just didn not grab me . for these reasons , i didn not finish reading it . so perhaps i m not the best person to write a review . nevertheless , that's my w
1			punk	poor	song	great	mess	big			. i m not a nfg hater or anything but i bought this cd cause i thought all downhill from here was a great song . but this cd is just 13 other tracks of poor pop punk . i cant even remeber any other song off the cd besides all downhill from here because all the songs sound the same and just kinda mesh together in one big mess .
1			i	disappointed			disappointed in your advertising . since i did not reaiize the pilot was also the first episode , i was very disappointed to have purchased it twice . once as the pilot and once as the first episode of stargate atlantis season one . evidently , my fault for not having ever watched stargate atlantis before , but still frustrating !
1			it	hate			i wish this song would go away . this song is more of a destinys child first album song . this didn not sound well coming out of a grown woman at all . i hate it .
1			character	strong			anita deserves better . this series has gone steadily downhill for the last 3 books , in my opinion . lkh has taken a strong female character and turned her into a nymphomaniac . if there was a plot to help things along , i wouldn not mind so much , but incubus dreams has almost zero plot . bring back anita blake , vampire hunter !
1			waste	complete	tv	direct	it	compatible	internet	extensive			not compatible with direct tv . from what i have read in my extensive research internet there is no code that will work with this tv to make it compatible with direct tv or any other universal remote . it works okay as a dvd player and it does have a vga port so it's my emergency backup computer monitor but , as a tv , it was a complete waste of money .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			tiresome and predictable . after several books , alex cross , becomes increasingly tiresome , predictable , and preachy . neither the aforementioned cross , nor author patterson , seems to have grown or matured in this this one .
1			it	difficult			inferior product . the display window does not light up , making it difficult to see at night .90 days after use , the display window went out completely .
1			radio	typical	look	like	they	suck			boaring . pearl jam look like and sound like a typical radio friendly manufactured crap band now , and what the hell is up with vedder ? ! this band used to kill onstage and have brilliant they just suck .
1			i	wrong	itself	excellent	o	big	anime	good	series	entire	vol	complete	anime	excellent			a good anime . the anime itself is excellent . big o will always be one of my favorites but my one complaint with this is the packaging when i bought it i assumed with the name the big o anime legends complete collection that it would well complete collection all the episodes just not the first season . if it had been named the big o anime legends complete collection vol 1 then i could have assumed there would be a second vol but with out that i just assumed that it would be the entire series and ended up buying vol 2 a week later after sadly realizing i was wrong
1			piece	nice	install	correct	seemed	cumbersome			just didn not work . physically seemed like a nice piece of hardware but it simply didn not work . installed the drivers from the web rather than the disk so i would be sure to have the latest version . seemed to install properly and asked me to do a calibration after install . since the calibration ran fine i assumed install was correct . when i tried to scan i got images that looked like digital noise . tried multiple times with the digiscan software , omni page , and with the business card reader . never got anything but noise . tried to call tech support but they were closed . software seemed cumbersome anyway . decided to just return it . am going to try the fujitsu scansnap 1300 more money and larger but hopefully will work better . scanners aren not rocket science and they aren not new so i don not know why they shouldn not just work right out of the box .
1			encounters	good	respect	little			resist the temptation . all these power people pushing their own agendas has left little respect for others . these are the people who drive 95 miles an hour and run you off the road , the people who care about nothing but materialism , the people who are setup for shallow relationships and failed marriages . i don not want to meet power people , i want human beings who care about others , value something other than money and success , can deal with conflict in ways other than trouncing weaker people , who live by morals and ethics and respect others boundaries , who think about something larger than themselves , and who build intimate lasting friendships instead of hollow feel good encounters devoid of meaning .
1			item	wrong	they	identical	series	complete			wrong item ! ! do not order . i ordered this item but instead i gotsonic the hedgehog the complete series . which is an item i already own ! check the product details . they are identical tosonic the hedgehog the complete series ! ! do not order until the problem is fixed
1			space	large			defective . this is the only sd card i have ever had that gave me errors . i have a bunch of transcend 4 b cards which work ok . this card is garbage . if i shoot a bunch of photos with it , several will have a large rectangular blank space in them . no way to fix the files . this is completely random happens on maybe 2 of the shots i have taken , but there always are some that have this problem . i m going to try to return it .
1			i	disappointed	way	hard	unit	new			metra 70 -2001 . do your research ! despite what the page says , this harness will not fit a 2004 gmc envoy ! i was very disappointed i had the harnesss soldered to my new head unit and ready to install , only to find out the hard way that i needed to purchase a different harness
1			scholarship	best	figure	historical	fiction	credible no	star	real	joan	real	woman	real			shame on you , luc ! 8 out of 10 for technos ; 3 out of 10 for drama ; 1 out of 10 for history . besson's joan is a raving vengeful femme and bears no resemblance to the real joan of arc , so well documented by dozens of scholars . don not for one minute be fooled by his revisionist joan ; the real woman was a real star and a saint . i was left with a feeling of anger , as if a fraud had been perpetrated , because besson's joan simply cannot have achieved the heroism that the real joan so patently did . her trial and life are among the most well documented of any historical figure , and besson's joan disavows or ignores what the best scholarship has long established . a modernist gothic horror it might be , but it's cheap cinema because this joan is just not credible and even cheaper fiction . don not infect your children with this a history .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			covert operations . i was disappointed with the cd . i was also disappointed with the fact that the samples of this cd did not match any of the songs on this cd . almost to the point of being , shall i say deceptive .
1			music	great	songs	nice	performance	vocal			where is the feeling ? i am a follower of gloria's music , but not of her voice . alma caribena has great music and production , but it lacks of sentiment and feeling from her part . maybe she should think about her vocal performance a little more . nice songs though .
