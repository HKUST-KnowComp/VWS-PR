2			area	rural	it	amazing	me	happy	era	modern	looks	great			in watching how the two brothers interact and feed off of each other through the whole movie makes me personally happy to live in the rural area much like they did in the movie . i have watched this movie countless times and have the book right beside my bible . after watching the movie i agree that this is one of the few movies that does a book justice . i strongly recommend anyone that has the chance to go to montana to fish or be outdoors to do so . it is amazing . i can not think of anyone else that could play the role better than brad pitt . do yourself justice and watch one of the better movies in the modern movie era . strongly recommend and as a guide for fishing trips in both montana and wyoming , do not try to learn how to fly fish from the scenes of the movie because although it looks great on the film you have no idea how much practice and skill fishing like that actually takes . thank you for listening watch this movie please if you would like a long sad movie .
2			skills	good	guy	big	you	familiar	job	marvelous	you	surprised	relief	comic	dialogue	bad	actors	professional no	development	good			i picked this up in the would anger after dark box set , and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of hyde and gackt . i expected a corny horror film that was a huge gore fest and with very bad dialogue . which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in america . instead i found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters , and the way that sho gackt develops through the movie as a person . the acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good , considering they aren not professional actors , and the director did a marvelous job with it all , setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboards . on a side note , taro yamamoto's performance was very surprising . the only other film i have seen him in is battle royale , where he plays shogo kawada , and in this film he seems to be the exact opposite of shogo . toshi is bright , exuberant and hyper , serving as a sort of comic relief with his antics . shogo was the big tough guy on the island who killed without thinking anything of it . so , watch out for his performance , if you are familiar with battle royale , you will be very surprised by him . but don not be thrown off by the summary on the back of the box , because this isn not really a vampire movie . it's just a movie with a vampire in it . that hyde's character is a vampire is almost a background fact with what's really going on in the foreground , and you guys will love the last scene . it's a really moving picture at some points , the photography is really well done . it's definitely something to pick up the next time you are at blockbuster .
2			it	funny	stuff	shocking	it	amazing	it	enjoyable	woman	old	stuff	weird	it	best	boy	young	melodrama	fantastic			perhaps the last film you would expect to come from vittorio de sica and cesare zavattini who wrote the novel on which this film is based . it's a neorealist fantasy , kind of an oxymoron , really . an old woman finds a baby in her cabbage patch and raises him as her own son . after a few years , the baby is a young boy named toto and the adoptive mother is dying . he goes to an orphanage and , when he finally turns 18 he leaves . immediately , he finds that he has no home . toto is optimistic , though , and won not let anything get him down . a man steals his valise , and instead of getting angry over it , toto becomes his friend and goes and stays with him in a small shantytown . toto takes some initiative and organizes the many homeless living in the area and they build a better shantytown . soon , the landowner is trying to sell this plot of land , and the citizens of the shantytown have to protect themselves . after many attempts , the owner mounts a force of police to get rid of the homeless . at this point , the film becomes full fledged fantasy before this it was more comedic / fantastic melodrama in the style of charlie chaplin . this stuff is so weird and shocking that it's probably best for others to see it for themselves . it's quite amazing , and very funny . there are objections you could raise about the plot of miracle in milan , most certainly . fellini and visconti were greatly criticized when they started to stray from neorealism . i think i read this was widely criticized at the time of its release . at this point , though , it's so enjoyable i loved it very much . it might be my favorite of vittorio de sica's films , although umberto d and the bicycle thieves come very , very close . 10 10

2			correctness	political	movie	old	rights	individual	help	little	story	great			let's eliminate any discussion about the use of non asian actors playing asian roles . the movie is 67 years old . in 1937 studio chiefs believed that any actor could / should be able to play any role . actors were under contracts , and did not always have a choice about what role they played . end of story . this is a truly great epic story of love , individual rights , class strata , and men / women issues . the centerpiece of the film is two brilliant performances by luise rainer and paul muni . muni plays wang , a chinese farmer , who is about to take a wife rainer . from the start , he treats her with respect , during a time when women were looked on as little more than hired help . without giving too much of the movie away , they go through the highs and lows of all relationships , and even though the story may take place in late 19 h / early 20 h century , the story and much of their feelings , seems credible . other than the fact that the movie is about 5 -10 minutes longer than it needs to be , and the performances of charley grapewin and walter connolly are typical 1930 s cartoon characters , this is a really wonderful movie that , unfortunately , has become a victim of political correctness . 9 out of 10

2			movie	good	republicans	young	fair	good			excellent good fair poor `go ahead , make my day ! the fourth picture in the series is directed by eastwood himself who was rumored of directing most of magnum force and he brings back the violent society from the first two fil ms however , the film still lacks impact and believability . this film was released in the early ` 80 , the time of regan and the young republicans . the premise of a raped woman taking vengeance on her rapist doesn not appeal to this time frame . this plot would have been better for the enforcer , which actually would have made it a good movie . what sudden impact needed was a plot like in wall street but with dirty harry in the middle . rating 3 stars

2			they	suck	fights	best no	even	best	fights	good	duel	best			scott is right . the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie . the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good . however , the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies . chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value . especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies , japanese movies excel , example being the lone wolf and cub series . even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most , the sheer intensity of those moments made them better . but , this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese . the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever . the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene . if you haven not seen it , you have to . john woo is the man .

2			circuses	different	director	new	it	ambiguous	film	great	manner	definitive	sample	great	window	great	one	single	bit	little	window	true			i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films , because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc so , that being said , i would just like to say that if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great hitchcock film just as much as vertigo north by northwest psycho rear window etc now , that may be overshooting a little bit , the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above , but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920 and early 1930 , i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them . as an almost brand new director , there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career . granted , the film does start with , among other things , the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and i use idiot in the definitive manner , the way stephen king so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people . i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then , but i think it is one of the most off putting sequences in any hitchcock film i have seen . the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round , but when he meets his match , it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger . so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman , who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly . spoilers there is , for example , a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and , just before going into the building , she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss . this kiss is never explained , and there is also the fact that , even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband , or at least ultimately chooses him , they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss . the film is certainly beautifully photographed , even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years . there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack's trainer who , in his stone faced expressionism , reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton . hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous , but this is a great sample of his early work .
2			acting	great	storytelling	great			i instantly fell in love with pushing daisies . this show manages to put a smile on my face with it's great storytelling , witty dialog and great acting . but that's not all it also manages to keep you until the end . the basic idea behind the show bringing people back to life with one touch , ending the undead status with a second is interesting and could still be in later seasons . but the suspenseful murder cases , the unique look of the show and the highly proficient narrator add to the experience . but pushing daisies is more than it's parts . it has a certain charm that i really enjoy and i m looking forward to enter the world of ned and chuck for a second season .
2			media	visual	boards	young			a delightful piece of cinema storytelling in a simple but effective way . cinema after all is a visual media and igor used its full potential . a young restless man boards a train with no destination in mind . in one of the compartments he meets with a girl . words are not exchanged but their laundry washing are and from there we are taken on a ride with other peculiar characters and situations . the two leads are perfectly cast as their unique features tell you a story that needs no words .
2			experience	original	movies	different	production	entire	it	easy	atmosphere	stunning	cars	classic			fido is to be commended for taking a tired genre , zombies , and turning it into a most original film experience . the early 50 atmosphere is stunning , the acting terrific , and the entire production shows a lot of careful planning . suddenly the viewer is immersed in a world of beautiful classic cars , eisenhower era dress , art deco furniture , and zombie servants . it would be very easy to dismiss fido as cartoon like fluff , similar to tank girl , but the two movies are vastly different . fido has structure , a script that tells a story , and acting that is superior . make no mistake , this is a daring black comedy that succeeds where so many others have failed . highly recommended . merk
2			feat	easy			besides the fact that my list of favorite movie makers is 1 stanley kubrick 2 god allmighty 3 the re st . this movie actually is better than the book and the tv miniseries though this is an easy feat , considering the director . the flawless filming stile , the acting and kubrick's all time number one skill the music make it the masterpiece of horror . i watched the tv miniseries a few years ago and liked the story and i had my hopes about this when i got a hold of it . it blew me away ! ! it is far better than i ever imagined it . it starts slow kubrick trademark and has a lot of downtime that builds up the suspense . the intro scene is a classic by all means and i watched it about 20 times just for the shear atmosphere it induces to the whole film . also the film doesn not offer a lot of gore it has just enough and it is by no means tasteless a trend that i hate in recent day horror fil ms just watch it !
2			case	criminal	star	big	movie	good	man	young	believer	great	actor	solid	plot	various	attorney	civil	plot	contrived	man	good	performances	good	confident	successful			walter pidgeon is braley mason , a civil attorney who takes on a criminal case in the unknown man , a 1951 film also starring ann harding , barry sullivan , keefe braselle , and richard anderson . a great believer in justice , pidgeon accepts a pro bono case defending a young man , rudi walchek braselle accused of murder and gets him acquitted . shortly afterward , he realizes that the man is guilty and was extorting protection money from his victim as well as other shopkeepers in the neighborhood . he is advised by the da sullivan that rudi is small change , that to wipe out the organized crime , one has to find the top man . mason finds the top man , and is faced with a dilemma . the unknown man is a small , black and white film that manages to hold the viewer's interest with its various plot twists , though the plot is somewhat contrived . it's really the story of a good man seeking his god , justice , and what he is willing to do in order to attain it . and that's the most contrived part of all . i suppose there was a time before o . j . the menendez brothers , etc , etc , when people believed in justice and the integrity of attorneys . for this viewer anyway , those days are long over . walter pidgeon does an excellent job his handsome , elegant demeanor and declamatory voice show us a successful , confident man but also a deeply caring one . pidgeon had a magnificent career spanning 60 years but never really rose to superstardom . he was a solid actor who could play just about anything and did . it may be because by the time he was getting leads , he was well into his thirties and missed being a matine idol ; or it could be he lacked that certain something ; or that he was typed early on as second lead to a big female star like greer garson . hard to say . he gives an honest and touching performance here . very good movie with good performances .
2			myself	busy	father	old	brother	mad			i keep watching this movie over and over and over . i have to watch it at least once a week . i am from africa and looking at that movie taught me some things that i didn not even know about africa . denzel's movies are all full of lessons for people of walks of life . i wish he was my own brother . i have also seen and love your masala mississipi . what a thrilling situation . when denzel was trying to hook his brother up on the job , reminds me of my teen ages when my brother was always mad with me about getting myself busy all the time . my brother was always caring for my old father and he wants to see me the same way too . by the way where did denzel get that african accent from in the cry freedom movie ? i have first seen that movie in africa and i didn not know then that denzel was american till i moved down here .
2			it	difficult	movies	different	story	personal	stewart	good	it	worth	miles	good			the history of the fbi , as told from the point of view of agent stewart via flashbacks , interwoven with his personal life story . stewart and miles as his wife are pretty good , as is hamilton as an earnest agent . the problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved . it's like watching bits and pieces of a dozen different movies as we get glimpses of a who's who cast of gangsters . some of the episodes are too long , some too short , and some just look out of place stewart's daughter's school sequence . overall , it goes on way too long . nevertheless , it's worth a look for its handsome production values .
2			man	old	we	smart	story	real	g	live	power	real	feel	compelled			on paper , this movie would sound incredibly boring . the idea of a 75 year old man traveling the country side on a riding mower certainly doesn not have much appeal to it , but the real power behind the film is its charm and its intelligence . writers will not find a better study of what makes a movie work than the straight story . the perfect example of this is a scene in which alvin meets a runaway teenage girl . she's pregnant and afraid of what her parents would do if they found out . alvin tells her a story about his own kids , long ago . he had them each take a stick and break it , which they could easily do . then he had them bundle the sticks and try to break them . that bundle , he said , is family . so many other movies would feel compelled to continue and make sure we knew that an individual could be broken but together the members were stronger . the straight story realizes that we are smart enough to understand this and simply leaves us to contemplate the thought and draw our own conclusions . alvin's journey across iowa is full of such refreshingly un hollywood character interactions . each interaction is full of warmth and humor , and alvin is so cute riding his mower that we can not help but smile as he makes his way to wisconsin to make peace with his brother , lyle , who has suffered a stroke . and the simplicity of the final scene emphasizes that the real story here is not the destination but the journey . it's a journey in which alvin shares his life with everyone he meets to their benefit and ours . it's a slow , simple , relaxing ride meant to remind us of all that we have lost with the urbanization of america . the straight story is the rare live action g rated movie that truly should not be missed . grade a
2			hank	great	rage	false	performance	best			i saw this in theaters and absolutely adored it . geoffery rush gave the best performance as a super villain that i have ever seen since gene hackman as lex luther . kel mitchel and paul rubens were a match maid in heaven . this film also introduced me to william macy , who is now one of my favorite actors . hank was great as the blue raja , and i especially loved that the character wasn not really british . the scene with him and telling his mom that he was a superhero almost brought tears to my eyes . i loved the fact that the bowler talked to the ball . some of the funniest stuff involved stiller and his character mr furious's false rage , and the fact that his threats and one liners were all gibberish , and that they never made any sense . i could barely stop myself from applauding when he said fraculater , freinken puss , was said . but one of the things i most enjoyed was that captain amazing actually dies in the movie . i highly recommend this film for any occasion , and i give it my own personal two thumbs up .

2			ranking	good	car	open	picture	new	milestone	french	music	wonderful	experiment	real	experiment	psychological	it	famous	topics	similar	movie	intelligent	movie	thrilling			first time i saw this movie was in the eighties , but reviewed now this thriller is still actual . some newer movies focus on similar topics , but they do not match this french milestone . a president obviously jf kennedy gets shot in an open car during a public appearance . the resulting huge investigation finds the lee harvey oswald figure of this movie guilty , but one member of the jury insists in further inquiry . he reveals some surprising evidence . unlike oliver stone's jfk a movie with the same plot this one does not play with emotions , but concentrates in a exciting description of a conspiracy and how everything fits together , drawing a new picture of the assassination . even a real psychological experiment is used for this explanation of the crime scene . compared to jfk this movie is more reasonable , intelligent and thrilling . parts of the plot can be found in a lot of newer movies , i had a kind of deja vu sometimes sitting in the cinema . i . comme icare is a must see . its unique and brilliant , and the music by ennio morricone is wonderful . this movie deserves a very good ranking , if it was a hollywood production it would be famous for sure .
2			i	surprised	twist	nice			i have seen a lot of tv movies in my time as a student , the majority the normal waste of time that us television throws out . this one , however , was well crafted and plotted and had a very nice twist at the end . having only seen richard dean anderson in macgyver and stargate i was surprised with his excellent performance rather than the rather gamut of expressions from a b that he normally gives . it was a pleasant surprise to see daphne zuniga after quite a long time dating back to the fly ii . also nice to see robert guillaumme in a leading role again . i can not say that i ever take jane leeves seriously after her benny hill days but she just about managed to cope well in her role . all in all a highly recommended film .
2			songs	greatest	n	greatest	alternative	great	tension	emotional	endings	good	series	best			rock star inxs was the best music tv series i have ever watched ! it had some of the greatest rock n roll songs ever written , performed by 15 very talented singers / performers . it also had in my opinion the most heart felt , feel good , surprise endings in all of reality tv . it actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner ! ! over the 13 weeks of this televised competition , the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants . after 30 some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality tv show . and the fact that inxs was , and still is , one of the greatest rock n roll bands ever just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series . if you don not have the series recorded , rock star inxs the dvd is a great alternative .
2			you	sick	actors	awesome	movies	best	track	excellent			as the one line summary says , two movies have left such a remark on me when i walked out of the theater . the one was stir of echoes with kevin bacon , and the second was vanilla sky . its one of those movies that you sit deep in the theater seat and stop thinking about anyone around you , stop wondering what the end of the movie will be and just leave the movie swift you where it wants . walking out of the cinema was a bit weird , like that feeling you get when you are sick and cant think of anything . one of those movies that you become one with the guy , and feel that nothing else moves around you than the things in the movie . one thing is certain . the actors are awesome , the sound track is excellent , and everything in the movie is 9 . surely one of the best movies i ever saw , and the movie that made the best and most shocking awaking about my life and my purpose in this world .
2			others	powerful	facts	real	accusations	naive no	happiness	real	people	different	states	united	couple	happy no	panorama	complex			first of all , i don not understand why some people find this movie so anti american . sure , there are moments when the the united states are accused directly , like at the segments of youssef chahine , ken loach and , to a certain extent , mira nair . but come on , they aren not naive accusations ; instead , they are based on real and documented facts , and all the documents that the cia released about chile confirms this , for example . but returning to the film itself , what i enjoyed most on it is the variety of moods we find in it . we find children being educated for the respect of the all the people who died in the event ; we find a unhappy couple that will be changed by the tragedy of that day ; we find common people that have their feelings downgraded on the shadow of the events of september 11 and react differently to this , with dignity or frustration ; we even find someone in the movie for who the fall of the towers grounds for a moment of real happiness . all these visions and others as powerful as these or even more make a consistent blend and help the spectator to have a glimpse about how different people spread across the world reacted to the events of september 11 h . thus , what we see is a panorama that is much more complex than whites and blacks , and this may make some people infuriated ; but this is the world where we live , and in it there is no place for manicheistic ideologies , regardless of what presidents or priests may say us . finally , i think it's a shame that there isn not even a release date for this movie in the united states of america . it's a shame because most of the american people is asking why this catastrophe happened , and this movie could give some clues to them . this film puts very clearly differently of what some people of this forum think that everything we do today will determine our future , and that the errors of the past will affect how we live today .
2			gamekeeper	jealous	general	popular	upstairs	frantic	count	glamorous	machinations	political	speaker	french			ingrid bergman is a temporarily impoverished polish countess in 1900 paris who finds herself pursued by france's most popular general and a glamorous count and that's on top of being engaged to a shoe magnate . such is the failproof premise that entrains one of the most delirious plots in movie history . there are backroom political machinations by the general's handlers , a downed balloonist and ecstatic bastille day throngs , but the heart of this gorgeously photographed film is the frantic upstairs / downstairs intrigues involving randy servants and only slightly more restrained aristocrats . yes , it's rules of the game redux . before it's all over even gaston modot , the jealous gamekeeper in rules , puts in an appearance as a gypsy capo , no less ! things happen a little too thick and fast toward the end , resulting in some confusion for this non french speaker , but what the heck elena and her men is another deeply humane renoir masterpiece .

2			film	definitive	men	vicious	lake	dead	folk	local	squeal	infamous	georgia	northern			as peckinpah did with straw dogs , and kubrick with a clockwork orange , director john boorman delivers an effective film about man's violent side in deliverance , arguably a definitive horror film of the 1970 . burt reynolds , jon voight , ned beatty , and ronny cox portray four atlanta businessmen who decide to take a canoe trip down the wild cahulawassee river in northern georgia before it is dammed up into what reynolds calls one big , dead lake . but the local mountain folk take a painfully obvious dim view of these city boys carousing through their woods . and the following day , continuing on down the river , beatty and voight are accosted and sexually assaulted the film's infamous squeal ! sequence by two vicious mountain men bill mckinney , herbert cowboy coward . thus , what started out as nothing more than a lark through the appalachians has now turned into a nightmare in which our four protagonists come to see the thin line that exists between what we think of as civilization and what we think of as barbarism . james dickey adapted the screenplay from his own best selling book , and the result is an often gripping and disturbing shocker . often known for its squeal ! and dueling banjos sequences , deliverance is also quite a pulse pounding ordeal , with the four leading men superb in their roles , and mckinney and coward making for two of the most frightening villains of all times . a must see film for those willing to take a chance .
2			american	young	it	strange	details	little	impact	terrible	fanaticism	german	argument	terrible	details	stupid	techniques	new			lars von trier is never backward in trying out new techniques . some of them are very original while others are best forgotten . he depicts postwar germany as a nightmarish train journey . with so many cities lying in ruins , leo kessler a young american of german descent feels obliged to help in their restoration . it is not a simple task as he quickly finds out . his uncle finds him a job as a night conductor on the zentropa railway line . his job is to attend to the needs of the passengers . when the shoes are polished a chalk mark is made on the soles . a terrible argument ensues when a passenger's shoes are not chalked despite the fact they have been polished . there are many allusions to the german fanaticism of adherence to such stupid details . the railway journey is like an allegory representing man's procession through life with all its trials and tribulations . in one sequence leo dashes through the back carriages to discover them filled with half starved bodies appearing to have just escaped from auschwitz . these images , horrible as they are , are fleeting as in a dream , each with its own terrible impact yet unconnected . at a station called urmitz leo jumps from the train with a parceled bomb . in view of many by standers he connects the bomb to the underside of a carriage . he returns to his cabin and makes a connection to a time clock . later he jumps from the train at high speed and lies in the cool grass on a river bank . looking at the stars above he decides that his job is to build and not destroy . subsequently as he sees the train approaching a giant bridge he runs at breakneck speed to board the train and stop the clock . if you care to analyse the situation it is a completely impossible task . quite ridiculous in fact . it could only happen in a dream . it's strange how one remembers little details such as a row of cups hanging on hooks and rattling away with the swaying of the train . despite the fact that this film is widely acclaimed , i prefer lars von trier's later films breaking the waves and the idiots . the bomb scene described above really put me off . perhaps i m a reali st
2			farrell	great	loretta	beautiful			i saw this movie yesterday on turner , and i was unable to stop watching until it was over , even though i sort of could guess what would happen . farrell was great in her role , and everyone else did a super job . some of it seemed to stretch the limits , but all in all , i loved it ! if you get the chance to see it , please do ! i actually cried at a few scenes , but then i guess if you are a mom you would . loretta is beautiful , and i was just in astonishment at the very idea of their being unwed moms there , it seemed ahead of its time . i say , watch it if you can , and don not listen to criticis ms as they say , i laughed , i cried ! i thoroughly enjoyed it !

2			heroes	vulnerable	message	relevant	food	precious	moments	nice	moments	little	visuals	futuristic			soylent green is . a really good movie , actually . i never would have thought it . i don not really like heston in his sci fi efforts . he's one of those actors who , like superman , manages to come across all sneery and invincible most of the time . i prefer more vulnerable heroes . and indeed , he sneers his way through much of soylent green , too , but as he's supposed to be playing an overconfident bully i don not really mind . i can understand why some people would turn their noses up at this movie . soylent green makes no effort whatsoever to create futuristic visuals what do you know it looks just like 1973 , and it's lacking in action . but i admired the film's vision of a complex , corrupt , and highly stratified society , and i was so pleased to see that edward robinson had such a moving , funny final role . nice little character moments like when he shares some precious food with heston really make the movie . the message of soylent green is pretty relevant these days , when nobody seems to know what the hell the government or corporations are up to . funny , isn not it , to see heston in a prototype michael moore movie .
2			movie	best	lines	best	argument	classic	argument	academic	librarians	capable			this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would be librarians . all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship . the public library vs . academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students . it also breaks many librarian stereotypes . librarians might even be capable of having fun even if they don not usually have sex in the romance languages section ! the best movie about librarians ? desk set , with katherine hepburn and spencer tracy , of course .
2			boobies	nice			overall i found this movie quite amusing and fun to watch , with plenty of laugh out loud moments . but , this movie is not for everyone . that is why i created this quick question ere , if you answer yes to any of the following questions than i recommend watching this flick 1 do you enjoy crude sexual humor ? 2 do you enjoy alcohol related humor ? 2 do you enjoy amazingly hot girls ? 3 do you enjoy viewing boobs ? 4 do you enjoy viewing multiple boobs ? 5 did i mention all the nice boobies in this film ? if you noticed the spoiler alert , that is referring the mass amount of nudity you can expect in the movie , i myself have no idea what the plot was about . not that it matters .

2			company	good	nothing	new			i thoroughly enjoyed this movie , but it is nothing new . everyone here is grouping it with other war movies , this movie has been miscategorized ! its not a war movie any more than one flew over the cuckoos nest is a asylum movie or cool hand luke is a prison movie . this is a movie about individuality , nonconformity , self confidence and the costs of that personality type . the plot is the same as one flew over the cuckoos nest and cool hand luke , its in good company , and it holds its own . its these movies it should be held up against and compared , not apocalypse now or platoon . eric

2			actor	great	he	likable	dancing	best	it	great	smile	great	numbers	musical	movie	great			this really is a great movie . some of the songs have become immortal classics and the dancing by fred and ginger is among their best ever . but basically , all of fred and ginger's movies are the same . after the singing and dancing is over , it's the other characters in the movie who make the movie work . what really bothers me is why all the negative comments about randolph scott ? his romance with harriet hilliard and the sub plot of the movie is the reason why i watch this over and over again . he adds to this movie , he doesn not detract from it . he has a winning personality and a great smile . randy is in my top ten all time favorites li st it's great to see him as something other than a cowboy . ok , so he isn not really a great actor , but like so many other stars errol flynn , alan ladd , victor mature , etc he was very likable and could rise to the top on certain occasions . all of fred and ginger's movies had sub plots that depended on other actors to fill in the space between the musical numbers , otherwise the movie would have to be shortened by about a half hour . i just wish more people would appreciate randy and i felt a need to stand up for him .
2			comedy	best	kline	flawless	lady	best	najimy	wonderful	character	hilarious	i	biased	field	perfect			anyone who doesn not laugh all through this movie has been embalmed . i have watched it at least twenty times and i still get tears in my eyes at many of the scenes . sally field is absolutely perfect as celest talbert , a fading soap star whose supporting cast is trying to get her replaced in hopes that their own star will rise . fields , at 45 still has that wonderful and beautiful pixie quality and a perfect figure that belies her having had three children . i m biased , i m in love with her . the cast of soapdish is filled with stars who perform their roles to perfection . kevin kline is flawless , as are robert downey jr . an ingnue elizabeth shue , whoopi goldberg , teri hatcher in one of her early roles , carrie fisher as the oversexed casting director who auditions an actor for a small part as a waiter without his shirt on . kathy najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer , and best of all , cathy moriarty as nurse nan who leads the plot to get fields character removed from the show is hilarious . this movie should have won oscars for best comedy , best leading lady in a comedy , best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests , including writing , directing and supporting actors and actresses . get the dvd so you can watch it over and over for the next twenty five years . you will still be laughing at it when the disc wears out .
2			acting	ludicrous	me	wrong	zorro	best	difference	big	mexico	central	legion	different	serials	best	fans	great	presence	strong			there have been a lot of zorro films made over the decades , but it's a shame that one of the best is probably one of the least seen . zorro's fighting legion is a bit different from other zorro fil ms first off , it's a republic serial in 12 chapters . and this time , zorro is not played by a top studio star like douglas fairbanks , tyrone power or antonio banderas but instead by workman like actor reed hadley . while hadley does not cast as strong a presence over the proceedings as those other , he does an adequate job , helped by the fact that he is not the sole hero here ; as the title implies , he has a fighting legion to call upon . another big difference is that the setting isn not california . the story here take place in central mexico in 1824 where a man posing as a living god incites the indigenous indian population and a band of outlaws to aid him in his plan to overthrow the newly established mexican republic . something , zorro , and a handful of followers plan to do anything they can to stop . don not get me wrong , there is at least one incredibly cheesy moment per episode , from corny twang bow sound effects to ludicrous acting . but overall , this represents one of the best republic serials of all time , and probably the best zorro one . the plot is stronger than most serials and never becomes incomprehensible or meandering . and there's lots of great action fans of the indiana jones movies will notice many bits borrowed from this serial .
2			she	funny	comedy	good	thing	classic	it	bad no	comedy	perfect no	thing	worst	thing	classic no	scene	single			a guy thing may not be a classic , but it sure is a good , funny comedy . the plot focuses on paul jason lee , who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and becky julia stiles lying naked in his bed . before he can figure out what happened , he rushes becky out of his apartment because his fiance karen selma blair is coming . after that , as you could imagine , chaos ensues . almost every single scene in a guy thing delivers loud laughs . the funniest moments come from when paul imagines what could happen if he tells karen . selma blair is a truly talented comedian , and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused . although , she turns out to be more funny than stiles character , who actually isn not that interesting . of course , not every comedy is perfect . as i said , a guy thing is no classic , but it's not bad either , 7 10
2			it	hard	girl	long	jersey	new	girl	little	film	earliest	example	good no	feature	previous	girl	rich	girl	poor			i haven not read through all the comments , but at least one poster mentioned that the 30 minute version might possibly be abridged . i m curious about that myself because the later parts of the film just didn not make much sense to me even when i rewatched them . 30 minutes seems really short for a movie in 1917 also . poor little rich girl which was tourneur's next film is 65 minutes long and pride of the clan which was his previous feature was 84 minutes long . so i m relieved to see that i wasn not crazy , there must be part of this film missing and that's why the resolution didn not make much sense . it's hard to review or comment on a movie that you are only able to see half of . but i would recommend this film anyway because of the really fascinating view that it provides us of the insides of an east coast movie studio of the time . it's the earliest film i have personally seen that's based on the movie industry itself . the main character is a movie star played by robert warwick , who was later a mainstay hollywood character actor and appeared in almost all of preston sturges fil ms he plays a western actor perhaps vaguely modeled on william hart , who warwick does resemble somewhat . after the really fascinating sequences set in the studio we see them on a location shoot where he discovers a country girl doris kenyon and convinces her to come to new jersey for a screen test which goes very poorly . after that point the movie seems to be missing major pieces in the form we have now . again , i would recommend it to anyone who's interested in film history for the documentary value , but in the form we have it doesn not hold up much as a movie and isn not a particularly good example of maurice tourneur's work .
2			yorkers	rich	yorkers	neurotic	yorkers	new	it	hilarious			match point and now scoop have both convinced me that not only is woody allen doing a neat job making movies in england and that scarlett johansson is the right cast member , but corroborated what i have known for years he shouldn not focus on neurotic rich new yorkers . in this case , johansson plays journalism student sondra pransky , whom magician sid waterman allen puts in his disappearing box , where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter joe strombel ian mcshane , who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued london were committed by millionaire peter lyman hugh jackman . so , she gets to know him , i don not know how much i can tell you without giving it away . but i can say that this is probably allen's funniest movie in years . there's his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religion . so , you are sure to like this movie . if nothing else , it will make you fall in love with london . but mostly , it's just so damn hilarious . even if you don not like woody allen , you gotta love this one .
2			glimpses	worth	scenes	worth			fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini . street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching . combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again . . and maybe again .

2			sequences	exciting	friend	best	depth	great	debt	great	boy	young			i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd . james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty , a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent . his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life , which is not all rosy . his wife an excellent portrayal by vera miles lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job , and they even separate for a time ; chip's best friend and fellow agent sam crandall murray hamilton is killed in a gunfight ; chip's son , mike , enlists in the marines during world war ii . through it all , the family carries on with bravery and dignity . the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi documentary style of the film works effectively . and the music by max steiner says it all ; fidelity , bravery and integrity . this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and , yes , to edgar hoover as well . if mr hoover's type of vigilance had been observed , we might have been spared 9 11 the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we have had to put up with since his passing .
2			atmosphere	comic	fans	comic	caprice	big	disorder	severe	book	comic			dick tracy wasn not the best for many comic book fans , because they wanted something with blood like batman . dick tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun . warren beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers . i have liked dick tracy since i was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors red , blue , orange , yellow , green and black . this is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children . al pacino is like the jack nicholson in batman and plays big boy caprice with ze st madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn not play the same boy toy she represents . like i said , no blood , obscenities , sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody .
2			type	big	photography	excellent	film	foreign	movie	big	movie	happy	movie	excellent	job	good			this movie was excellent . a sad truth to how culture tends to clash with the sexes . this is just one big warm fuzzy type of movie . you have the master who is steeped in tradition and kind hearted in his own way , doggie despite being a girl thing to win his affections and you top it off with one cute monkey with a thousand facial expressions . this equals on big happy movie in the end . this movie does a good job at showing how steeped in tradition one can be , so steeped that they are willing to die without sharing their secrets . you see sides to a culture never seen before which helps enhance the drama that unfolds near the end of the picture . the cinema photography is excellent , in particular the opening parade sequence with all the sparkers . bound to be in oscar contention for best foreign film .
2			friends	jealous	friends	best	surprise	unexpected	beginning	new	piece	powerful	instructor	young			this is a very moving picture about 3 forty something best friends in a small england town . one finds a passionate loves and a new beginning with a younger piano instructor , when tragedy strikes and hearts are changed forever . definitely a film to have a box of tissues with you ! a powerful piece of work . this is definitely one of my favorite films of all time . spoiler ! ! spoiler alert ! spoiler ! the main character is taken by her young , handsome piano instructor and a passionate romance blosso ms her two jealous friends play an immature prank which quickly leads to tragedy . she loses her love and her friends in one foul swoop . in the end a unexpected surprise pulls them back together . in my opinion her forgiveness is not warranted

2			cast	entire	it	funny	cast	impressive	descendant	direct			i know , that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of lineage it's a direct descendant of the best years of our lives and the men . films dealing with men who are in the hospital dealing with tragic circumstances . but this film is full of wonderful surprises and performances . it features stellar performances from eric stoltz and helen hunt including a rather risque nude scene and wesley snipes and william forsythe . as emanuel levy wrote in his book cinema of outsiders about the independent film movement the waterdance is coherant , attentive to detail , and unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor it s at once funny and sad , and the entire cast is impressive . i was extraordinarily moved by this film , it's hard hitting yes , but also has very tender moments and laugh out loud moments . a rare gem .

2			way	hard	movies	interesting	man	old	town	safe	movies	old	cooperation	old	cooperation	good	juggernaut	cute			old horror movies are interesting , plenty of screams , plenty of shouts , and plenty of humor to go along with it . the blob is a classic in it's own work . steve mcqueen 1930 -80 plays a teen who tries to be a hero in his town . going out on a date with his girl is rather typical for all teens . but when the old man discovers the same falling object form the sky , he ends up being the victim , and steve helps him out the best he can . when its up to teen power , this movie really provides it . i know most teens have had their hardships when they act up , when danger comes around , they must learn to forget the past and start doing something good to save humanity . when the adults in town ended up learn the hard way about the blob running amok , they must learn to trust teenagers and not let their behavior get the better of them . the oozing juggernaut was rather cute in the day , and in my opinion i think it was jell o ! when everyone pitches in to stop the menace , the town is once again safe , thanks to good old cooperation . i still eat jello and watch this movie all the time , if you don not like jello , tough ! rating 5 stars

2			it	brilliant	fanfare	little			as alan rudolph's breakfast of champions slides into theaters with little fanfare and much derision it makes me think back to 1996 when keith gordon's mother night came out . now for all the talk of kurt vonnegut being unfilmable it's surprising that he has gotten two superb cinematic treatments the other being slaughter house five . mother night is certainly one of the most underappreciated films of the decade and i cannot understand why . it's brilliant ! it stays almost entirely faithful to vonnegut's book without being stilted or overly literary and adds to it a poetry that is purely cinematic . how many film adaptations of any author's work can claim that ? vonnegut himself even puts in a cameo appearance towards the end of the film , and can you ask for a better endorsement than that ? not only is it a beautiful film , it is a beautifully acted , written and directed film and it is among my picks for the top five or so american films of the 1990 . it's a mournful , inspired , surreal masterpiece that does not deserve to be neglected . i would sincerely encourage anyone to see mother night it doesn not even take a familiarity with vonnegut's work to fully appreciate it as slaughter house five sometimes does . it is a powerful , affecting piece of cinema .
2			guy	obnoxious	executive	lucky	instincts	comic	she	happy no	profits	great	it	accessible	roles	dramatic	technology	new	delight	silent	man	new	skills	comic	comedies	great	south	old	films	finest			1928 is in many ways a lost year in motion pictures . just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre , sound was coming in and while reaping great profits at the box office was setting the art of film making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology . show people is one of the great silent era comedies . the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him , learns his lesson , and then redeems himself by winning the football game , the polo game , etc this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane . she had excellent comic instincts and timing . this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies like adventure of peggy pepper marion davies and her father , general marmaduke oldfish pepper , fresh from the old south . general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress . while at the studio commissary , the peppers run into billy boone william haines , a slapstick comedian . he gets peggy an acting job . she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick , but she perseveres . eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles . soon the new found fame goes to her head , and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man , whom she doesn not really love , unless fate somehow intervenes . one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent era films and in its early sound era films is feature shots of how film making was done at mgm circa 1930 this film is one of those , as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph , an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself , and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot . peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn not care for her . truly a delight from start to finish , this is a silent that is definitely worth your while . this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible .
2			filter	soft	tricks	subtle			i lived in tokyo for 7 months . knowing the reality of long train commutes , bike rides from the train station , soup stands , and other typical scenes depicted so well , certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which i really , really liked . there are aspects of japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you don not have to speak japanese to enjoy this movie . director suo's tricks were subtle for the most part ; i found his highlighting the character called tamako tamura with a soft filter , making her sublime , a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that i was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters . or cried . or laughed aloud . wonderful . a .

2			reminder	constant	force	unstoppable			this is one of my all time favorites . if the movie has a flaw , it's that it comes at you like a raging bull . it doesn not so much engage the viewer as assault him . 'scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as tony montana himself . nothing is left to the viewer's imagination . moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee . like the chorus in a greek tragedy , it wails and gnashes , broods and tugs , a constant reminder of tony's inexorable fate . not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress , 'scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train .

2			york	new	jungle	urban	film	great	moves	young	tv	commercial	hit	big	picture	best	city	bad			young , handsome , muscular joe buck jon voight moves from texas to new york thinking he will make a living by being a stud . he gets there and finds out quickly that it isn not going to be easy he goes through one degrading experience after another . at the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled , sleazy ratso rizzo dustin hoffman . together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to florida . but will they make it ? very dark , disturbing yet fascinating movie . director john schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of nyc and its inhabitants . in that way it's dated the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now . he also uses every camera trick in the book color turning to black & white ; trippy dream sequences ; flash forwards ; flash backs especially involving a rape ; shock cuts ; weird sound name it . it keeps you disoriented and off center but i couldn not stop watching . there isn not much of a story it basically centers on the friendship between rizzo and buck . there is an implication that they may have been lovers the final shot sort of shows that . it's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold , cruel , urban jungle . this was originally rated x in 1969 the only reason being that the mpaa didn not think that parents would want their children to see this . nevertheless , it was a big hit with high schoolers back then x meant no one under 17 . it also has been the only x rated film ever to win an academy award as best picture . hoffman and voight were up for acting awards as was mysteriously sylvia miles who was in the picture for a total of maybe 5 minutes ! it was eventually lowered to an r with no cuts when it was reissued in 1980 also the excellent song everybody's talkin was introduced in this film and became a big hit . a great film but very dark . i m giving it a 10 don not see it on commercial tv it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible .

2			it	inspirational	princess	gorgeous	plot	true	music	great	movie	great			this movie is a great . the plot is very true to the book which is a classic written by mark twain . the movie starts of with a scene where hank sings a song with a bunch of kids called when you stub your toe on the moon it reminds me of sinatra's song high hopes , it is fun and inspirational . the music is great throughout and my favorite song is sung by the king , hank bing crosby and sir saggy sagamore . overall a great family movie or even a great date movie . this is a movie you can watch over and over again . the princess played by rhonda fleming is gorgeous . i love this movie ! if you liked danny kaye in the court jester then you will definitely like this movie .

2			balance	good	it	interesting	version	scary	version	new	intro	superb	i	glad	score	superb	it	worth	score	musical	comics	old	job	great	guy	new			this post may contain spoilers although it was 5 years after the series ended and wb was currently working on justice league , this animated movie is a welcome addition to the video library . why ? well , if mask of the phantasm compliments the first 70 episodes of batman the animated series and subzero compliments the 15 episodes of the adventures of batman and robin , then mystery of the batwoman compliments the final 24 episodes of the gotham knights version of batman . kevin conroy once again delivers a voice over performance that is nothing short of excellence and perfection . i admit i was a bit leery when i heard about batwoman and all i could think about were the old 50 s comics of batman . but i was blown away by the batwoman character , her look , her costume which i assumed inspired bruce wayne to create the costume on batman beyond and the fact that this movie keeps you guessing who batwoman is all the way through . if you want to know who batwoman is , then buy or rent the dvd . barbara gordon makes a cameo appearance and i think the writers were trying to hint that bruce and barbara had something going on between them like they did in batman beyond . tim drake appears as robin , but his role is a small one and sadly , there is no sign of or mention of dick grayson alias nightwing , which leads me to believe he has established himself in bludhaven his city in the comics . of the three suspects for batwoman , my favorite is kathy duquesne , who looks an awful lot like halle berry . kelly ripa did a great job as one of the other suspects . when it comes to the villains , i m glad the penguin was one of them , but i did not like the fact that they replaced paul williams with david ogden stiers . pengy just didn not sound right . same thing goes for robin . the new guy did okay , but just as i was starting to get used to matt valencia , they replaced him . it's interesting to note that kevin michael richardson , who voices carlton duquesne is now the voice of the joker in the batman series . and we finally see what rupert thorne looks like revamped since he didn not show up in the gotham knights episodes . the late john vernon will be missed . although i enjoyed henry silva as the voice of bane , if he had to be replaced , they got the right man in the form of hector elizondo . i only wish they could have used two face , riddler , or the scary new version of the scarecrow . the musical score and especially the soft sounding intro were superb . i wish that was on a soundtrack and i especially enjoyed the beautiful and talented cherie in the iceberg lounge along with her song , betcha neva . while some feel that this movie is weaker than the mask of the phantasm and subzero , i find it just as strong and enjoyable as the rest , plus like i said earlier , it's a full length movie based off the gotham knights version of batman , which i think gives a good balance . i would at least recommend renting this dvd first before buying it for those who might be leery of this movie , but personally , it's well worth the purchase . i give mystery of the batwoman a 9
2			look	amazing	setting	atmospheric	topic	important	one	previous	manner	vicious	issues	social	signs	different	cinematography	gorgeous	portrayal	patriotic	night	miserable	centerpiece	psychological	issues	serious	life	true			victor mclaglen , the title character of john ford's the informer , reminded me of the circus man from fellini's la strada . anthony quinn played the brutish man , who may have even been influenced by the pug faced , oscar winning performance given by mclaglen . poverty stricken dublin is the true life , atmospheric setting of the picture , which takes place in 1922 dense fog and a long damp night are the main elements of a story about deep irish patriotism and the fight of the irish republican army . the conflict of individuality and the cause is what makes the informer tick . mclaglen's large , simple character just wants to go to america and we are reminded by signs of the price for a ticket frequently . two different signs become the psychological centerpiece for the drunken irishman . one is the previous , the other a wanted sign . should he do it and get the money to go ? john ford once famously said , my name is fo rd i make westerns . after seeing this film , he obviously could do a heck of a lot more . the serious social issues dealt with here are heartfelt and ones you will find yourself thinking about . and the look of the piece is amazing , consisting of long dark shadows cutting into a miserable ireland night . ford was always known for his luminescent , gorgeous cinematography that helped to foresee the conflicts within his characters . this is hard in color , but he did it in pictures like the searchers , painting john wayne in a sometimes vicious manner . victor mclaglen's performance not only benefits from the lighting , but by the sheer simplicity of his acting . he shoves a lot . he knocks people out . he is a brute who knows no better . he should , however , know whether or not to cross the ira . see the film to find out the gritty details . see it also for mclaglen and ford's patriotic portrayal of the ira . max steiner's score is innovative in how it matches gestures of the characters , placing more emphasis on them . this was usually only seen in silent films , especially chaplin . the topic of naming names or informing is obviously still important . just look at how the media covered this year's oscars , giving much attention to the elia kazan scandal .

2			dimension	new	perpetrator	real	screenplay	great	actors	best			great screenplay and some of the best actors the world has ever produced . montand gives the concept of the lone wolf police detective a whole new dimension of intensity and , most importantly , credibility . when a typical hollywood cop heroe loses family , friends and pets to murder he is usually given his minute of grief . but when the sixty seconds are over , he pulls himself together , packs his gun and goes gleefully shooting up his enemies one by one . montand's marc ferrot , however , is really devastated by his girlfriends murder , of course , but also by finding out that she had another his confusion and wrath he does not seek revenge but needs to keep going to find the real perpetrator of a crime where his fingerprints are all over the scene . thus all his actions become unescapably logical . this is the main reason why this movie glues us to our seats but definetely not the only one .
2			movies	great	performer	great	examples	best	it	real	sync	special	performances	special	remake	musical			barbra streisand is a tour de force in this hollywood story . her performances and the songs are one of a kind and are special in the halls of great movies . the scene where she is introduced to the unexpecting audience by kristopherson , against the crowds wishes and hers , only to turn them around with her magnificent performance of woman in the moon is one of the best examples on film of how well a great performer can win over an audience . it's real . the scene where she records evergreen ranks with the best in the business . all live , no lip sync , very special . streisand is often criticized for being a diva , but she delivers on this one . she is majestic singing with one more look at you . she deserved the oscar she and paul williams got for evergreen . kristopherson had his moments too , far above most of his movie appearances . this version of the born franchise ranks with the first one of 1937 janet gaynor , frederic march although i will always enjoy judy garland and james mason musical remake of 1954 i haven not seen the dvd yet and don not know about its quality .

2			track	good	reflection	solid	actress	great	cinema	french	actors	famous	actors	french	careers	active	she	serious			les acteurs is the absurd story of jean pierre marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water , the story of a conspiracy against actors , the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be , but a stunning tribute to french actors and their cinema . supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting the fourth wall , the hidden cameras , to play or not to play , the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera the film is not voyeur is quite vague , and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing . as andr dussolier quits the film and leaves josiane balasko to play his part great actress , she's hilariously serious especially when , in dussolier's role , she bitches about herself , as actors run in each other on the street , asking for autographs , as fights and gossip happen , we recognize pastiche of other scenes in which each or others have played . actually , for whoever does not know the actors most of them being at least in their 50 or does not know french cinema , this movie has less interest , since most of the references will be missed , but it will still offer a good track of reflection on aging , on acting , on public life .

2			story	interesting			maybe it's because i saw the movie before reading the book , but i really love this movie . i have seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more . it's a compelling story , that's interesting from the beginning to the end . it has everything action , romance etc
2			nature	true	something	good	effort	complete	it	intriguing			if there is one thing to recommend about this film is that it is intriguing . the premise certainly draws the audience in because it is a mystery , and throughout the film there are hints that there is something dark lurking about . however , there is not much tension , and williams mild mannered portrayal doesn not do much to makes us relate to his obsession with the boy . collete fares much better as the woman whose true nature and intentions are not very clear . the production felt rushed and holes are apparent . it certainly feels like a preview for a much more complete and better effort . the book is probably better . one thing is certain taupin must have written something truly good to have inspired at least one commendable effort .
2			mission	serious	performance	best	yard	longest	reader	big	him	convincing	comedy	big	me	anxious	job	good			being that i am not a fan of snoop dogg , as an actor , that made me even more anxious to check out this flick . i remember he was interviewed on jay leno , and said that he turned down a role in the big budget adam sandler comedy the longest yard to be in this film . so obviously , snoop was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops . i m not going to overpraise snoop for his performance in the tenants . there are certainly better rapper / actors , like mos def , who could have done more with his role . but the point is snoop did a good job . he can not seem to shake off some of his trademark body movements and vocal inflections , but that's something even jack nicholson has a problem doing . the point is i found him convincing in the role , and the tension between him and dylan mcdermott's character captivating . mcdermott , by the way , gives the best performance in the film , though his subtle acting will most likely be overshadowed by snoop's not so subtle acting . being a big reader and aspiring writer myself , i couldn not help but find the characters and plot somewhat fascinating . it did aggravate me how snoop's character would constantly ask mcdermott to read his work , and berate him for criticizing it . but you know what ? i m sure a lot of writers are like that . his character was supposed to be flawed , as was mcdermott's , in his own way . my only mild criticism of the film would be its ending . for some reason , it just felt too rushed for me , though the resolution certainly made sense and was motivated by the characters , rather than plot .

2			charming	charismatic	adult	single	life	real	way	easy no	he	scared	morning	quiet	family	entire	it	easy no	burden	heavy	he	charming	film	complete	comedy	new	humori	sharp			marie you are smooth . dan no , i m not smooth . i m dan . if you are anything like me , smooth and single do not go together . you see someone you like , rare enough as that can be , and you want to say something but you don not . or maybe you do say something but it ends up being perhaps the least intelligent thing you have ever said in your life . more often then not though , you stare from afar and admire without having to deal with taking that which most agree is the only way to get anywhere in life a risk . you can not blame a guy for being a little frightened though . maybe he's been burned hard before or maybe he's trying to focus all his energy on his career . there are reasons , some valid , some not , and all of them can be interpreted as excuses rather than reason . you tell yourself you don not need it or it isn not the right time for you but you still wish it were happening . any way you break it down , it's not easy . sound familiar ? if you thought yes even just a little , then dan in real life , the new comedy from director peter hedges , is a must see . it will reach inside of you and somehow manage to both break and warm your heart all at once . the dan from the title is dan burns steve carell , an advice columnist who is admired for his insight into living a balanced , fulfilling and morally uplifting life . four years or so before the film opens on dan waking up to his day , he lost his wife and love of his life . after that tragedy , dan was left to raise their three daughters alone . between that and focusing on his career , finding love again was not one of dan's priorities . and so he became more functional than feeling . removed from the power of intimacy , dan no longer knows what it means to be that close to someone and has resigned himself to never knowing that again . that is , until he meets marie juliette binoche in a book and tackle shop in connecticut on a quiet morning . they are interaction is casual , comfortable and it catches both of them off gua rd there is only one problem really . she is already seeing someone . unfortunately for all involved , that someone is dan's brother , mitch dane cook . his entire family has come up to their parents country home for their yearly visit and dan must now spend the weekend pining and yearning for the fleeting feeling he had with marie that morning . it only lasted an hour or so but it only took that long to awaken dan's heart from its coma . with so many family members to deal with jack mahoney and dianne wiest are at the helm , dan in real life does drift away from its grander purpose from time to time . while the cyclone of kids and parents and aunts and uncles makes for trying times for dan , hedges also uses it unnecessarily as a means to distract , with the presumption that it would ultimately make for a more complete film . luckily , hedges has got carell to carry the heavy burden . it is a pleasure to watch steve carell come into his own more and more with every picture he makes despite the occasional evan almighty sized misstep . he is charismatic , charming and obviously a sharp humori st as dan , he is also self deprecating , awkward and scared . carell is the rare comedian who pushes himself to find character in his roles rather than rely solely on his comedic instincts and established persona . perhaps more importantly , he is entirely relatable as dan . whether he's flopping down on the cot in the laundry room where he is subjected to sleep as the only single adult at this reunion or fidgeting around the kitchen , unable to stan d still in his anxiety , dan is every guy who has even been unsure of himself and felt alone in the crowd . carell gives dan so much heart that he becomes the heart of the film itself at the same time . i wondered after seeing the film if i enjoyed the it as much as i did , despite its slight shortcomings juliette binoche i know you might like to lighten up every now and then but i don not recommend it unless there is chocolate involved , because of where i am in my life . would someone who has found that someone else derive as much meaning and comfort from this film ? i can not say . what i can say , as someone who knows what it means to be lonely , dan in real life knows what it means to be surprised by life and love and how these moments and people need to be appreciated and cherished . it also knows that anyone who might be feeling lonely on any given day or for months at a time needs to be reminded that surprises still happen .
2			things	horrible	film	great	miike	honest	tales	disturbing	fears	real	tales	classic			takashi miike's incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements . this is a fairy tale that dares to be dark . even as a kid , i thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales ; horrible things happen to people in most children's books . miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance . the filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom . he accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with never ending hazardous missions . westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids . i appreciated the fact that miike was more honest than most american filmmakers . he goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain . but a self possessed miike is still stranger than most filmmakers . i thought it was a great film . highly recommended .

2			focus	sharp	film	different	wife	neurotic	one	remarkable			yet again , madhur bhandarkar takes you on a ride to the wild side . and a remarkable one it is , literally and figuratively . mumbai hi society stars and starlets , glam dolls and witch doctors , business tycoons and broker types , yep the whole stinking lot are in sharp focus here . in typical tabloid fashion , their worlds unfold , with every colorful story a clever sub plot in itself . a struggling starlet dumped by the producer after getting her pregnant , the stewardess and her high profile husband , the pedophile businessman and his neurotic wife , the reporters and the police captain ; all shades on display and countless hues in between . bhandarkar does a swell job of digging up the dirt on the drama kings , the dancing queens and the living dead . atul kulkarni packs a punch , as does boman irani and sandhya mrudul . konkona sen sharma is effective as the ex crime beat reporter , but she could have been dolled up a little in keeping with the job change and the party circuit . highly focused running time 140 min and refreshingly different film , well worth the money .

2			aren	good no	color	beautiful	scene	famous	music	glorious	enthusiasts	classical	musicals	classic	favorites	classical	scene	best			a recent viewing of that's entertainment has given me the urge to watch many of the classic mgm musicals from the forties and fifties . anchors aweigh is certainly a lesser film than on the town . the songs aren not as good , nor is the chemistry between the characters . but the film beautifully interweaves classical favorites , such as tchaikovsky . and the scene at the hollywood bowl , with sinatra and kelly emerging from the woods above it at the top , and then running down the steps , while dozens of pianists play on the piano , is the best scene in the film , even though the scene in which kelly dances with jerry mouse is more famous . classical music enthusiasts will no doubt identify the music the pianists are playing . sinatra then croons , i fall in love too easily , before having his epiphany about whom he loves . the color is beautiful , hollywood looks pretty with its mountains and pollution free air can you imagine hollywood in the twenties , let alone the mid -1940 ? and the piano music is absolutely glorious . mgm certainly had a flair for creating lyrical moments like these .
2			film	great	rental	great	it	difficult	date	expensive no	gem	little			i admit i have a weakness for alternate history stories , from its a wonderful life to groundhog day to 12 01 among those greats is this little gem . it's pretty difficult to get through mr destiny without giving a nod of appreciation to each and every cast member , from the goodhearted james belushi to the murderous courtney cox . this movie lacks the gravitas and scale to make it a great film , but it's a fine cheer up on a rainy afternoon . it's also a great rental for an inexpensive date .

2			violence	domestic	end	low	supermarkets	funny	exterior	nice	movie	disturbing			trailers of this movie may show scenes of violence or non mainstream sexuality , but these scenes are just rare fragments , picked out to attract audience . they are , of course showing the main message of the movie people who are constantly kicked on their heads in their jobs and lives , using power , which they may have somewhere else , to notoriously oppress others . and at the low end of the oppression chain , mostly women . a movie showing this as brutally as hundstage is surely tough to face , but having to endure such lives , is even tougher . technically the film is much like short cuts , but consisting of documentary style episodes , featuring people like your neighbour , playing just the way they are . without any glitter , and most disturbingly , without any hope . its documentary style makes the movie even more disturbing , because you realize , such people are out there , and there are many of them , although our society focuses on the nice exterior looks . somewhere the porn industry has to do its business , somewhere unreported domestic violence has to take place , somewhere hopes have to shatter . i sure do know such people . if you want to see a movie without any funny scenes some may think the handicapped woman repeating the top ten supermarkets is funny , but this happens for real and without any melodramatic , go watch this movie . however it will lose when you are focusing on subtitles i fear , as subtitles cant transport accentuation .
2			sociopath	well	film	tremendous			sorry , i don not have much time to write . i am not a psychologist but have known one for 25 years . she said that scott wilson portrayed a sociopath no conscience extraordinarily well . i agree ! she also said that robert blake portrayed a person with anger and impulse control who had a conscience but couldn not control himself superbly . i agree ! what a chilling and tremendous film . i have seen over 2000 films and would rank this in the top 100 my lifelong friend deals with clients such as these regularly . my only criticism was the preachy narration at the end of the film . many people grow up in less than ideal circumstances but only one in a million will behave as these 2 losers did .

2			movies	classic	mcbride	hilarious	way	hard			what was there about 1939 that helped produce so many excellent hollywood films ? well , whatever it was , the magic may also be found in this columbia picture . it's a long forgotten screwball comedy that turner classic movies has begun to show . maltin's movie book does not contain it . in nearly every department , amazing mr williams is a jewel . it's the story of a first rate police detective who can never find the time to marry his intended . as the wedding bells are about to ring , he gets called to the scene of a murder . the lady in question has to learn the hard way not only to enjoy the pursuit of criminals but to belong to the police force . there are a lot of laughs in the process . melvyn douglas proved again that he had few peers in light comedy . joan blondell was at the peak of her career and is a delight . edward brophy and donald mcbride are hilarious . the film goes on a bit too long , but who cares ? the screwball comedies are always able to entertain , and this film belongs right in there with the be st

2			cast	brilliant	idea	good	cast	international	story	complex	production	big	effects	special	it	authentic	television	french	versions	german	tv	french	nausicaa	famous	whole	beautiful	care	good	sword	classic	versions	french	plot	original	version	best	locations	natural			as it was already put , the best version ever of homer's epic . entirely shot in natural locations in the mediterranean . the sea and the sky are strikingly blue , the islands green and untouched . the clothing is linen , wool and fur , the settings stony and bare , everything is somewhat rugged and primitive , a bit what you would find in cacoyannis or pasolini movies , and it makes it all the more authentic . although the story is based on myths and widely goes into supernatural , it gives us a good idea of what life in the 10 h century bc might have been like . the rhythm is somewhat slow and austere , but the whole is so beautiful that you quickly get into it . actually , it is amazingly close to the original plot by homer , if not to the text itself . ulysses doesn not appear until the first hour , the start being centered on his son looking after him . then he suddenly appears lost in a storm , lands on the island of the pheacians where the royal family takes good care of him . his adventures are told in flashback as a narration to his hosts the terrifying cyclop , the magic world of circe , the underworld , the sirens etc he finally comes back to his homeland ithaca after 20 years , and it all ends dramatically with the killing of the pretenders of his faithful spouse penelope . as a story , the odyssey is an unparalleled metaphor of the struggles of a man's life . the cast is brilliant and international here . irene papas gives us a typical greek tragedy style performance as penelope , but most amazing is the albanian actor bekim fehmiu as ulysses . really good looking and totally convincing , it seems the role was really made for him . strange that he was never offered roles of this dimension afterwards . also playing nausicaa is barbara bach as barbara gregorini later famous as the james bond girl in the spy who loved me , and playing athena is michele breton , who was otherwise noted in the strange movie called performance with mick jagger . as it was done 35 years ago , the series was actually quite an innovation for its time , as the first big european co production for tv italy , france , germany and yugoslavia . i have seen this mini series in 8 parts on french television as far back as 1974 i was a kid back then , and although it was all in black and white , it left a very vivid impression . all my life long i wondered if i would ever get a chance to see it again , as it was never shown on french tv later on . i recently found a copy on dvd all in wonderful color through internet . it is unfortunately only in italian with no subtitles , although french and german versions existed back then . i never heard there was any english version of this film as it is widely unknown in the anglo saxon world , and it's quite a shame . if you ever get a chance to watch this , you are not going to forget it ever . there were not many versions of the odyssey before or after that . the one by camerini in 1955 starring kirk douglas is a classic sword and sandal like the 10 commandments , but not as impressive and very short for such a complex story . the one in 1997 by konchalovsky is a meretricious hollywood movie , based on special effects , sometimes quite gory , very poorly acted and grossly afar from homer's story and atmosphere .

2			behavior	bad	magazine	big	way	nice			simon pegg plays a rude crude and often out of control celebrity journalist who is brought from england to work for a big american magazine . of course his winning ways create all sorts of complications . amusing fact based comedy that co stars kristen dunst looking rather grown up , danny huston , and jeff bridges . it works primarily because we like simon pegg despite his bad behavior . we completely understand why kristen dunst continues to talk to him despite his frequent screw ups . i liked the film . its not the be all and end all but it was a nice way to cap off an evening of sitting on the couch watching movies . 7 out of 10
2			seem	familiar	it	available			this tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being . the irreverent pupils , the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils . the adult characters all seem familiar , my teachers , my bus driver , each one of their opinions so plausible and well known . when a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints . all the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip . mr harvey is experiencing much pain throughout . he reminds me of war damaged teachers i did not understand when i was an irreverent pupil . rhidian brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped british film . the acting unblemished , the scenes appropriate , it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity .

2			effects	special	opening	little	production	exceptional	sort	best	type	mysterious			i m not sure i understand where all these enthusiastically anti grudge people are talking about here , perhaps it's just that some people like to rant about things . the movie was certainly imperfect uneven acting , some may have had difficulties with the time changes , actors all too willing to go places i would really rather not go , etc but imho there were some things that more than made up for the imperfections . first and foremost , i loved the breaking of the rules bit . normally when you leave the haunted house the baddies leave you alone , giving you time to regroup , get friends , and find the token mysterious paranormal type . normally semi spoiler alert when you are hiding under the covers they can only get you through that little opening you peek through . normally at the end the ghosts somehow have become less creepy because you have found out they are just misunderstood , or they have been freed , or whatever . secondly , the production was exceptional . while the movie was hardly special effects laden the supernatural bits while brief were extremely well done . probably not the best sort of movie for those who think freddy and jason are the ultimate sort of horror nothing against em , they have got their place , but great for those who have begun to take the conventions for granted and who don not have trouble with the time distortions .
2			opportunity	great	look	comical	experience	enjoyable			interesting way of looking at how we as humans so often behave we are sometimes blinded by our desire to achieve perfection that we some times destroy the foundation of what we are trying to achieve . it also addresses the issue how we tend to ignore those among us who are not as outspoken and by doing this may miss out on a great opportunity . the injection of comedy also makes watching the film an enjoyable experience . a must see for anyone who is interested in a reflective yet comical look at life . i am eagerly looking forward to your next that you will continue to provide us with quality entertainment . excellent work . joanne
2			i	biased	movie	great			i simply love this movie . i also love the ramones , so i am sorta biased to begin with in the first place . there isn not a lot of critical praise to give this film , either you like it or you don not . i think it's a great cult movie .
2			girl	cautious	actor	scary	movie	thrilling	character	bad			red eye is a thrilling film by the creator of freddy kreuger , wes craven . wes craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker lisa . after attending the funeral of her grandmother , she decides to take the red eye flight . during waiting , she meets this man named jack rippner , how fffrreeaakkyy is that ? and they sort of become friends . ironically , both sit right next to each other on this plane . then this is when the horror starts . this movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don not like thrilling / horror films , well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants . this is an excellent example of a bone shaking production . wes craven did well with this film . he chose the right actors , like rachel mcadams , an intelligent , sexy girl who knows what she's doing and is cautious of everything when she's acting in a film . cillian murphy , the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film , and his face can really widen your eyes . wes craven did an excellent job and i hope that he makes more films like this one .
2			screen	big	it	worth			this is a really interesting movie . it is an action movie with comedy mixed in . foxx teams up with comedian epps in this movie to give it a comedic spin . it will keep you wondering whats going to happen to foxx next . it was a well shot movie , the director used the right colors in this movie dark blue colors to give it the right kind of feel . kimberly elise also starred in this movie and it is always a pleasure to see her on the big screen . she plays her role well . even jamie kennedy is in this movie . it's worth seeing it you haven not seen it . it's definitely worth having if you are a jamie foxx fan . it deserves more credit than it is actually given .

2			movie	formidable			in die nibelungen siegfried , siegfried was betrayed . now , kriemhild seeks revenge . she marries hagen , and through a series of events , finally engages in a very drastic but fitting action at the end . one of the things about watching this movie nowadays is that we can look at certain portrayals . attila the hun called etzel in the movie is shown as the strange person from the east , possibly an allusion to the soviet union . obviously , it was not fritz lang's fault that hitler used the nibelungenlied for german national pride in the third reich , but one can see what the fuhrer liked about the story . nonetheless , this is an absolutely formidable movie .
2			movie	good	styles	different	one	good	albums	various	plot	predictable	reviews	good	minutes	total	kung	good			after reading tons of good reviews about this movie i decided to take it for a spin i bought it on dvd , hence the spin pun . i m a dork . the beginning was everything i hoped for , a perfect set up along with some quotes that i have heard on various wu tang albums to what should have been a good movie . but the plot i heard was so great , was so predictable . every time i saw a character except for the lizard i guessed which venom he was . plus , the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie . ok , so the plot wasn not very good but at least there was some good kung fu right ? wrong . the fights were very short and few and far between . granted the different styles were all pretty cool but i wish the fights were longer . i kept hoping to see the lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened . i was hoping to see the centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened . i was hoping to see the scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened . in short , not much happens . the fighting is all pretty routine . don not be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot , it does not mean it's a good one .
2			way	realistic	movie	touching	end	perfect	part	important	scene	dramatic	movie	beautiful	it	scary			i agree with the above comment , i love the realism in this , and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that . they take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again , which i dislike because its not reality . not meaning to say things can not get better , and not meaning to say things don not in this movie , but it doesn not spend most of the movie creating all these problems , and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again . when people have eating disorders people don not just admit it and want to get better , and then life is peachy , it takes time , and i like how in this movie we grow with the characters , we go through the difficulties with them , getting better and worse , because it is a very important part of the movie . it gets into the minds of people with eating disorders , and shows the complications and pain , in a very realistic way , and i loved that . i also love how it shows the secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders , it is scary to see how people react when they find out , especially if they approve of it . i thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told , and defiantly one of my favourites .
2			it	subtle	plot	simple	dvd	great	cousin	little	quality	realistic	novel	graphic	story	complex	movie	intelligent	book	comic			i loved so much about this time taken to develop the characters , the attention to detail , the superb performances , the stunning lighting and cinematography , the wonderful soundtrack . it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won not work for anyone who wants the typical fast paced action flick . if we lived in elizabethan days , i would say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy . but since we don not , let's say it's more like a drama suspense movie . the plot is simple , but the story is complex . the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored . much of the story is shown rather than told , which i find makes it more subtle and moving and which also works well for a story based on a comic book or graphic novel . at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930 , part of this story there was such a realistic yet dream like quality in the style of its telling . i don not often prefer movies to the books they were based upon , but in this case i do . though i did enjoy the book too . i have bought the dvd , which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary . i also took my little cousin , who's a little younger than the boy in the movie , to see it after i saw it for the first time , because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father son issues with him . he loved it and the discussion .
2			comedy	british	word	strong	film	terrible	film	awful			but the opposite , sorry bud , i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject and you have . this film is terrible , the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh , most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not gazing across to another with a look your line now , then i will react . best british comedy ? please buddy , have a strong word with your bad bad the end of the day sun goes this film is awful . i mean well done to the people have made a maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they are nan bought that overly harsh ? i do apologise .
2			sense	visual	dolls	real	personalities	different	doll	french	animation	powerful	something	new	songs	good	seem	necessary no	doll	new	it	believable	quality	aesthetic			this is a very strange film by director / animator richard willia ms all who know of william's work know it's a bit off kilter if not ingenious but this one takes the cake . it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way . the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality ; its strange character designs , its powerful animation , and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary . williams brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls , floppy and darned , rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls , which made it more believable at least in a visual sense . the animation shines on the bring us the camel with the wrinkled knees , whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end , the silent movie chase with sir leonard looney and , of course , the greedy . the greedy animation , on its own , is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i have ever seen . there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop and every second it's something new . living in what was deemed the taffy pit , the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets . he sings a song that i can not help but feel hold some sexual undertones , then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart . the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs . it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them . there are about six good songs which should have been the only ones including i look , and what do i see ? no girl's toy , blue though they didn not need to make him sing it twice , i never get enough , because i love you and maybe i m home . the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren not too amazing to listen to . this is a weird film with strange undertones , but if that's what you are looking for , you won not find better .
2			i	old	fan	big	i	young	music	great	place	special			rock n roll high school holds a special place in my heart because it introduced me to the ramones . i was too young during the band's mid -70 heyday to be very aware of them , although i had an older cousin who was a big fan at the time . i finally saw rnrhs on television one afternoon in the mid -80 when i was about fifteen years old , and laughed all the way through it . isn not it every high school kid's dream to trash his school and blow it up , all set to a rockin soundtrack ? i recorded a subsequent airing of the film a year or two later and kept watching the ramones concert sequences over and over again , thinking man , these guys kick ass ! i have to check out some of their albums ! the rest is history . twenty years , umpteen ramones lps / cassettes / cds , and three ramones shows later , they are still one of my all time favorite bands and rnrhs still cracks me up every time i watch it . now that joey , dee dee and johnny have left us r . i . p . all at least we have this movie and tons of great music to remember them by .

2			insights	good	plot	romantic			i have long wanted to see this film , being a fan of both peter cushing and david mccallum . i agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time , but the talent of mccallum shines through this juvie role . thank heavens for turner classic which aired the show last week . i can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war , especially with the way things were throughout the 1950 . some of the boys are a bit scary . i certainly wouldn not want to met them on a well lit street , much less a dark one . there were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well , or as they call him , a firefly .

2			china	rural	compliment	great	china	contemporary	action	good	guy	bad	fight	passable	jokes	visual			one of the better kung fu movies , but not quite as flawless as i had hoped given the glowing reviews . the movie starts out well enough , with the jokes being visual enough that they translate the language barrier which is rarer than you would think for this era and make the non fight dialogue sequences passable for a kung fu movie , this is a great compliment . unlike other chinese action movies , which were always period pieces or in the wake of jackie chan's police story i cop dramas , pedicab driver gives us a look at contemporary rural china . unfortunately , in the latter 1 3 of the movie it takes a nosedive into dark melodrama tragedy which i thought was unnecessary . the action is overall good , featuring a duel between sammo and 1 2 of the shaw brothers only 2 stars , kar leung lau and then a fight at the end with that taller guy who always plays jet li's bad guy . there's only 20 minutes of combat here , which is standard , but what annoys me is the obvious speeding up of the camera frames . i get that they have to film half speed to avoid hurting each other , but there are smooth edits and then there's this . it really takes away from the fights when it's this obvious the footage was messed with . that said , if you like kung fu movies , my opinion here won not dissuade you , and if you don not , you just wasted 2 minutes of your life reading this .
2			effects	special	score	great	scene	lesbian	thriller	hard			this is an excellent but hard to find trippy world war i spy thriller in the inimitable 60 s italian style . from the psychedelic graphics of the introductory credits and the great score by ennio morricone to the lesbian love scene with capucine and the elaborately produced apocalyptic no man's land battle scenes with poison gas and german cavalry in full gas proof 'storm trooper gear , this is a movie that should not be missed . it is a film that captures the horrors and cruelty of war and the ruthlessness of the players on and off the battlefield . apart from the battle scenes , some of the production and special effects are primitive , apparently because the bulk of the budget for this movie was saved for the battle scenes , but for lovers of 60 s cinema it should not be an issue . i first saw this movie on television many years ago and had the foresight to tape it on vhs . i still have the tape and enjoy watching it again from time to time .

2			challenges	old	interest	noble	woman	young	ruby	beautiful	person	young	evil	good	charming	quiet	ashley	gorgeous			ruby in paradise is a beautiful , coming of age story about a young woman , ruby lee gissing , escaping her stifling roots to become herself . although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd in likely her first movie role , albeit one to be quite proud of the emphasis is not upon becoming somebody , a la the next madonna whether jesus mother or the lurid , attention hungry singer . it instead emphasizes following ones instincts and being somewhat introspective about them , to grow into one's ideal , adult self . note this isn not an action movie ! ! it uses an occasional voice over narration by ms judd while writing in her journal and oh , i see i have just lost the male half of the readers out there . but be patient with this beautiful movie , where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in oh , i dunno , carrying water and chopping wood . actor / director / writer todd field , who played nick nightingale in eyes wide shut , co stars as ruby lee's noble love interest , one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth . but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee there's no external hero imposed upon her . the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves . writer / director victor nunez , who also wrote / directed ulee's gold , did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself confronting age old challenges of good evil along the way . the supporting cast is also stellar , and the music used , particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips whom i hear is the wife of bone burnett , is right on most especially trying to hold on to the earth . now , when i hear the first few chords of that song , tears spring to my eyes , pavlovian and unbidden not sure if it's the music , or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet , charming message of empowerment . this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his / her way . for any woman of any age , it is a must see ! the downside it is not on dvd , except in spanish . we learned , however , that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version , which can be readily found online . my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me . although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on air on an indie channel , usually you can not count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world . so buy a copy for yourself . this movie should have a major re release , and it would , if i were queen of hollywood . figgy jones

2			artist	comic	photos	old			some thirty years ago , author numa sadoul published a book length interview with the belgian comic book artist georges remi better known as herge , the creator of tintin . this movie catches up with sadoul today as he recalls the interview , while we listen to the cassettes herge died in 1983 and see some old photos and footage of the man himself . some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of herge , and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife , after he had an affair with one of his collaborators who years later would become his second wife . an interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books tintin in the congo , tintin in the lands of the soviets to fairly anti imperialist books just a few years later the blue lotus . on the whole , i come out of this movie knowing a few more things about herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when i come in to the theater .

2			movie	good	level	different	picture	different	ninja	mysterious	losses	miserable	feature	nice			it's a rather good movie , but too americanised in it's predictability . change the kung fu for football and the turkish family for a pakistani one , and you get to watch bend it like beckham 2002 almost scene for scene . a nice feature the serves as the backbone of the movie is the progression of fights with the mysterious ninja under the highway , beginning with miserable losses and slowly progressing until the last fight is a win against oneself , as the kung fu master stressed several times . on a different level , the danish life is revealed quite different than the image it has by outsiders the non indigenous immigrants that make a large proportion actually , the majority of the danish citizenry , the graffiti in the copenhagen suburbs , the taunting of the immigrant girl in the begging of the movie . all portray a different picture than one has in mind when one hears the word denmark .
2			hit	direct	d	former	bureaucrat	young			this is one military drama i like a lot ! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett . this marine is no nonsense , in your face , and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done . there you have billy zane the phantom and others who plays richard miller , a former swat form d . c . works for the government and takes orders only from them . who needs a bureaucrat ? i don not ! when these two are paired , sparks should be flying . and how . however , beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works . when the other sniper hits , it's wits vs . wits , cat vs . mouse , gunman vs . gunman . and when the seasoned sniper is caught , it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him . who needs politics when you a pro like beckett , he took orders from no one but himself , plays by the rules and not the book , and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics . the movie was a direct hit . watch it . rating 4 out of 5 stars .

2			acting	awesome	cinematography	great	sound	strong			the title says it all . i m not a film critic nor will i act like the rest of the snobbish people commenting on this movie . obviously this movie didn not have a multi million dollar budget , but the plot was very well done , the acting was awesome and the cinematography was great ! it looked like you all had a lot of fun making this movie ! i voted 9 out of 10 as the sound was strong on only one channel instead of both , but i imagine this might have been an error in the recording of the dvd . i will definitely be checking out other movies produced by brain damage films ! dylan o leary , cast and crew , i thank you !
2			man	young	job	remarkable	movies	best	actors	brilliant			this is absolutely one of the best movies i have ever seen . it takes me on a a roller coaster of emotions . i laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love ! all this in a little over two hours of time ! the actors are all brilliant ! i have to mention the leading actor of course , michael nyqui st he does a remarkable job ! i also admire the actor who plays tore , who plays this mentally challenged young man in such a convincing way ! he sort of reminded me of leonardo di caprios roll in gilbert grape ! and then there is the most beautiful song in the world gabriella's sng . i recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy !
2			light	constant	it	hard	effects	special	imagination	little	music	nice	e	little	fi	low	family	likable			bizarre , trippy , forget about a story and full steam ahead low budget sci fi about the williams family , living in the california desert . they become witness to a series of events that escalate in their level of strangeness ; apparently , they have been caught in a time space warp , where past , present and future collide . this is the excuse for a parade of highly amusing special effects a constant light and sound show , dinosaur like creatures that have at each other , a friendly and tiny little e . t . who enchants the granddaughter , and so on . this picture does show off a little imagination , if nothing else . very nice music by richard band , engaging special effects work from the likes of david allen , randall william cook , and peter kuran , and , importantly , a likable family are key assets . it generates a sense of child like amazement ; it may very well be that it's more of a romp for kids or the kids inside many of us who are able to gloss over any flaws in the narrative or presentation . i found it hard to resist ; it's a short and sweet 80 minutes diversion , and a decent credit for director john bud cardos of kingdom of the spiders fame and executive producer charles band . 7 10
2			i	wrong			as i saw the movie i was really shocked to see what the 60 s was about . i know i may be wrong about some things , but it seemed like the 60 s really had an effect on people of the time . some people said they would want to go back to the 60 s . from what i saw i would say yes for the excitement and no for the outcome . but that's my opinion .
2			you	good	determination	important	suburbs	poor	thing	worst			saw this film on dvd yesterday and was gob smacked and flabbergasted . the unaffected acting of ddl just blew my mind , and i was surprised by the whole cast and its superb acting . all of the character were so authentic to me , i really took ddl for christy burns and brenda fricker for his mom . go and see it ! you will cry your heart out , but you will experience a wonderful catharsis ! besides , it teaches you one important lesson determination is everything . you may be a cripple in the poor suburbs of dublin , but when you are headstrong enough you will have no problems at all . if you can only operate your left foot you are still good enough to be a painter or a writer . the worst thing you can do when you are mentally challenged is to indulge in self pity . it won not get you anywhere and the only person who will pity you will be yourself .
2			vampire	humorous	hyde	good	concept	original	film	amazing	character	lucky	movie	dramatic	movie	humorous			this film was amazing . it had an original concept that of a vampire movie meets yakuza mob film . it is a humorous and yet highly dramatic and tragic movie about friendship , love , immortality , death , and happiness , and comments subtelly on society . on the part of gackt camui , the role of sho was excellently delivered , and hyde was surprisingly good for his first film as the tortured yet humorous vampire , kei . i also laughed and cried at the happy go lucky character , toshi , who grew up with sho . i loved each and every second of this this film , especially moments such as the funny cigarette scene , the fighting scenes , and most of all , the heartrenching ending .

2			good	different	film	different	acting	superb	appeal	wide	looked	different	viewing	great	movie	great			i don not know why i picked this movie to watch , it has a strange title and from the description it just looked like something different . every once in a while its good to try a film that's slightly different from the mainstream hollywood hero / thriller flick and this film certainly was different . right from the beginning this film had me intrigued but i couldn not figure out why until the end if the film when i realized that the movie was great because the characters were so real . i thought the acting was superb and the character development really makes you care about them and hope things turn out well for them in the end . i think that everyone who watches the film could in some way relate to one of the characters and this makes for great viewing and some good laughs at the sheer ordinariness of the actors . at the culmination of the movie you definitely get a sense of well being , and are left with the not hings are going to be ok type of a feeling . i m sure this will have wide appeal and should be given a chance .
2			stuff	great	nitrate	single	it	ok	it	inventive			first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i would stumbled across it years ago . the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion , and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated . so , it's rocky viewing in places , but i have seen and survived much worse . it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus ; in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging , no parking signs in latin ; in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump . both him and beery are after the girl through the ages , a never ending tussle . favourite bit as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera an amazing second or two ! great stuff , reaffirming my love of silent film comedy .
2			people	realistic	weren	identical no	numbers	big	numbers	lavish			while there aren not any talking animals , big lavish song production numbers , or villians with half white / half black hair . it does have 1 thing . realistic people acting normally in a strange circumstance , and walt & roy did in their eras with the studio . if you thought think the castaways or the island at the top of the world weren not identical , or you hold them to a higher authority than atlantis , then your idealism is just as whacked as keeping your kids up till midnight to watch a friggin cartoon .
2			scenes	worthwhile	script	nice	films	original	clues	little	ending	rare	diggers	mechanical			i watched this film sort of by accident , having bought it as the b side on the omega man dvd . the omega man was a bit of a disappointment except for the beginning , which was clearly the inspiration for 28 days later , the rest of it is just the stuff of tv movies . but soylent green is in a whole other league . i bet this is one of tarantino's favourites . there are at least 3 scenes in the film that i have never seen anything like before . heston casually getting into bed with the furniture while discussing something else completely unrelated ! a whole crowd of people being scooped up by a fleet of mechanical diggers ! a priest taking confession and being shot by the confessor . ok maybe that's been done since but there aren not many films that are so consistently original like this . and what the heck is going on between heston and edward robinson ? is this the most unlikely gay couple ever , or what ? luckily , i saw this film without knowing the ending which apparently is rare . then i watched it again , and enjoyed all the little clues that make the long early scenes worthwhile . a very nice script and some great sets too . just when you thought you would seen everything . .

2			sister	interesting	stuff	classic	scenes	best	she	beautiful	anything	ludicrous	movie	great			spoilers ! classic 70 s sex trash ! the swedish gal helga was what made this movie so great . she was beautiful , but what really got to me was how sexual she was . she exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film . her best scenes were when she was , er , stimulating herself . whenever she was on screen , i became transfixed . also , the doctor julia sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film was very interesting visually . although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than julia , she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt also grabbed my attention unmercilessly . you also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid ; i don not know if i have ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time . classic stuff !
2			horrible	sensitive	scenes	painful	subject	horrible			saw this movie at the rotterdam iff . you may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut . especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch . hope it gets the distribution it deserves .
2			show	good	personalities	realistic	snobs	pretentious	they	noble	trek	original			the pilot of enterprise has one thing that has been lacking since the original star trek a dose of realistic , flawed personalities . the utopian characters of the next generation got tiring , they were so noble as to be unbelievable . i also like the sub plot that humans are bitter toward the vulcans . its funny seeing them as pretentious snobs . it makes me look forward to seeing when the humans become the dominant race between the two , though i don not think it would work in the time frame of the show . the only negatives that jumped out at me were the quick cut off the ending at 2 hours feel of the end , which is common among many of the trek shows . the second was the shameless dig for ratings by a couple of senselessly sexy scenes . it was out of place , a good science fiction show should be able to stand on its own without trying to pad the pre teen audience with some skin . but its not my job to make the show profitable , so oh well . lets see how the next episode does .
2			movie	good	favorites	young	movie	bad no	problem	big	character	evil	songs	good	feelings	mixed			this is my favorite of the three care bears movies . once again i liked all the songs . the big problem however as most people have pointed out was that this story contradicts the original . for those that saw the first movie recall the bears met their cousins who they apparently never knew about . it wasn not of course until the end that the cousins received their tummy symbols after proving how much they cared . in this story however the cousins grow up with the care bears and have tummy symbols all along . that being said this isn not a bad movie as long you keep it separate from the fir st i thought the darkheart character much more evil then the nicholas of the fir st but at the same time i felt it added a sort of balance to the sweetness of the care bears . i also liked the we care part at the end , although i know other people had mixed feelings about that scene . and of course i loved the songs . my favorites being growing up and forever young . the care bears movies have always had such good songs . ten stars for a very good movie .
2			films	new	trilogy	original	looks	bored	makers	concerned	it	hard	story	central	han	convinced	anything	new	experience	new	film	good	film	weakest	handling	weak	drama	real	battles	impressive	wookie	big	thing	contrived	he	central			this film is to my mind the weakest film in the original star wars trilogy , for a variety of reasons . however it emerges at the end of the day a winner , despite all its flaws . it's still a very good film , even if a lot of its quality depends on the characters that have been built up in the superior 2 installments . one problem here is the look of the film , which isn not very consistent with the other 2 fil ms i put a lot of that down to the departure of producer gary kurtz . the first 2 films have that dirty , lived in look with all the technology and so forth . in jedi on the other hand even the rebels look like they just stepped out of a shower and had their uniforms dry cleaned . this makes for a much less textured film . also the creatures were excessively muppet like and cutesy . at this point it seems like the film makers were more concerned with creating the templates for future action figures than with the quality of the film itself . another aspect is its lack of originality . where star wars created a whole new experience in cinema and empire brought us to alien worlds of swamps , ice , and clouds , jedi lamely re cycled the locations of the first film . first we are back on the desert planet tatooine , and then we are watching them face another death star maybe the emperor couldn not think of anything new . but you would think lucas or kasdan could . also we have these ewoks , who really are just detestable made for mattel teddy bears , in a recycled version of what was supposed to be the big wookie fight at the end of star wars if they hadn not run out of cash . it just feels like lazy construction . the most unfortunate aspect of jedi for me is the weak handling of the han solo character . whereas he is central to the plot of the first 2 films here he is struggling for screen time , trading one liners with the droids . instead of a real drama we are stuck with the lame pretense that han is still convinced leia loves luke as if the conclusion of empire where she confessed her love of him had never happened . the whole thing is very contrived and barely conceals the fact that the solo character was not part of this film's central story after his rescue . ford , for his part , looks bored and lacks the style that distinguished his earlier performances . this is more like a 1990 ford performance , bored and looking above the film itself . fisher for her part is visibly high in some scenes . lando , an interesting character introduced in empire , here is stuck as the ostensible person we care about in the giant space battle . only hamill , given an interesting development in the luke character , is really able to do anything new or interesting with his character . probably he was the only major actor in the film who still cared about his work . and to be fair the script gives him a lot more to do than the other characters . really it is his story and the other characters are only there as part of the package . ian mcdiarmid does excellent work as well as the emperor . the film would sink if he had been too far over the top as he was at times in the new films . visually and in terms of effects work , other than the clean look of everything it's hard to find fault . jabba is a very effective animatronic character , one of the most elaborate ever constructed . the space battles towards the end are very impressive . ultimately this film coasts to success based on the accomplishments of its forebears . but on its own , it is a satisfying piece of entertainment and imho far superior to any of lucas later productions .
2			breakthrough	real	studio	french	folks	young	initiative	french			if the answer to this question is yes , then you should enjoy this excellent movie . i have just seen it a couple of hours ago here in paris where the action of the movie takes place and i can still feel the huge trauma i received in the back of my a visual shock ! i have never seen such a beautiful black&white photo and such a drastic change in the way of doing animated movies . i strongly believe there will a before and after renaissance , similarly to what we saw with pixar movies or the akira and ghostintheshell experiences . this is a real breakthrough in the small world of animated movies and i hope this french initiative a small unknown french studio with a few young folks who had a dream named renaissance . will receive the success and recognition it deserves . vive la france !
2			plot	simple	roles	different	caine	big	we	best	life	good no	us	careful	names	big	moments	important			i actually like this movie even though i don not fancy james belushi very much . in this movie , you can actually see several big names on the rise , linda hamilton and courteney cox namely ; caine's was already big of course . the plot in this movie is simple ; its just like that sliding door movie . it however was told in a light hearted manner and i like the comedy moments in it . it made me trying to relive my own important moments in live , eg what if i have taken that girl out for a movie , and not the other etc it tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to change . it also reminds us to be careful what we wish for . life is not always as good on the other side as we think ; maybe , what we have now is the best for us , all things considered .
2			story	simple	animation	great	plants	flat	warrior	big	story	bad	development	real	girl	little	it	reminiscent			the world of the dragon hunters is a 3 gravity challenged world . planetoids , bits of buildings and strange flat plants float around in the atmosphere while the ground towards most of the characters are falling is nowhere to be seen . it is a world reminiscent of neverending story , when the nothing came to eat the world away . funny enough , the villain here is the world gobbler , as well . this time it is a huge skeleton dragon with fiery eyes . the heroes are a big yet taciturn warrior , an annoying and greedy sidekick managing the entrepreneurial side of the duo and a strange useless animal . they are joined by the most talkative little girl in the world who , to my chagrin , did not die a horrible painful and hopefully early death . the animation is great . the voices and the sounds are top notch . too bad the story is as simple as one can possibly imagine . they go to stop the world gobbler , they reach him almost immediately , they defeat him . the end . no real character development or story twists . not even the ones i would expect from a movie with such a plot . bottom line it's a cute thing to watch , kids would probably enjoy it , but that's about it . no depth to this world pun intended .
2			atmosphere	gripping	knock	real	holiday	conventional	story	important	film	good	example	good			the combination of the superb black and white photography and the eugene onegin with a twist plot made this a real knock out for me . the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping . there was a superb moment where where transparencies apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by lensky's heart wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin . for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium , which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film . krisana is in the same mould .
2			women	happy no	performances	romantic	it	amazing	classic	enjoyable			it has been about 50 years since a movie has been made about romance and mysticism . the only two movies i can think of is enchanted april 1992 and the enchanted cottage 1945 . both movies used wonderful actors not stars . in both movies , all the actors gave their best romantic performances . enchanted april is about four english women after wwi who are unhappy with their lives and find happiness in italy while on vacation . it is amazing enchanted april was made in 1992 it stands out as an enjoyable classic .

2			moments	comical	plot	original			i watched lion king more times that all my friends put togther . having a baby sister . you know how it is . by now i memorized both the plot and the lines . after lion king 2 came out i was like ok well let me see . the second one was significantly weaker . then i saw an ad for lion king 1 and 1 2 . i was like ok there we go again . after watching the 1 1 2 i was like wow . all my expectations for repetitevness were broken . a truly lovely and original plot keeps you glued to your seat for the entire time . i have noticed that the cartoon was filled with so many comical moments that roflmao will apply here 100 . i definetly recommend seeing the cartoon .

2			all	enjoyable	characteristics	similar	frankenstein	young	leads	great			let's set one thing straight this movie does not seek to redefine the genre , it's not dr strangelove o young frankenstein . it's a silly flick , with three great female leads can not remember any other comedy with similar characteristics , rachel dracht and amy poehler from snl and indie queen parker posey , charming as ever . the story is basic the three gals were losers in college , and are still after wards it . poehler is a dog trainer who can not even get a date with a blind guy , posey is an assistant for a senator who hasn not been touched by a man since clinton was in office . i catched that one several minutes later . i m a little slow , ok ! and dracht has a gay fiance seth meyers from snl , funny . they have to prevent the uncool daughter of the senator the always cute amber tamblyn from the tv series joan of arcadia to embarrass her during spring break . so of course they have to go to watch over her , and some hilarity ensues . all in all , a light , simple comedy , quite short , and quite enjoyable

2			ounce	original	looked	great	images	fresh	people	religious	crowd	modern	you	offended no	messiah	modern	world	modern	ounce	entertaining			i thought the whole movie played out beautifully with fresh images and interesting cinematography the whole way through it . the actors were on top of their character's backs in nearly perfect timing and looked great . the music was lush and well thought out . it even had a decent twist of an ending . so what's with everyone voting it down ? the story wasn not entirely fresh felt like a remnant of running man with the whole television show idea , but the attitude towards christianity and judaism about how the public picks their messiah certainly sounded true enough . it made sense to follow this one man who was put before a modern crowd and to put him on a pedestal because of his opportunity . it's possible that christians or other religious people pick this up because the movie has the word god in it , but that shows what the filmmakers were trying to do is to teach a possibility to people who maybe never saw the world like this , especially in the modern world where christianity has been more and more accepted and forgotten about by some . i gave it a 7 10 stars here on imdb . i thought every ounce of the movie was entertaining and original , for the most part . check it out if you are not too offended to see an entertaining film from madrid , spain , about possibilities of the coming modern messiah to a tv near you .

2			channel	special	thing	best	ability	legendary	you	disappointed no			i remember stumbling upon this special while channel surfing in 1965 i had never heard of barbra before . when the show was over , i thought this is probably the best thing on tv i will ever see in my life . 42 years later , that has held true . there is still nothing so amazing , so honestly astonishing as the talent that was displayed here . you can talk about all the super stars you want to , this is the most superlative of them all ! you name it , she can do it . comedy , pathos , sultry seduction , ballads , barbra is truly a story teller . her ability to pull off anything she attempts is legendary . but this special was made in the beginning , and helped to create the legend that she quickly became . in spite of rising so far in such a short time , she has fulfilled the promise , revealing more of her talents as she went along . but they are all here from the very beginning . you will not be disappointed in viewing this .
2			version	original	action	great			if you are a fan of zorro , indiana jones , or action in general this is a must see . directed by republic's ace team of william witney and john english , and starring reed hadley as don diego / zorro , this serial delivers ! i won not bore you with the plot who cares ? less talking , more fighting ; what really matters here is hadley's superb interpretation of the character / s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt . stunt spoilers follow you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter , trapped on a rope bridge a la temple of doom in another , does a raiders horse to coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him , exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom . in addition to all this , the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains , swings to safety , etc with his trusty lash . most of the sword work is fair to lame , except for chapter one , which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword / stunt legend ralph faulkner , who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez . this was the first serial i ever saw , on matine at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since . zorro's fighting legion delivers z goods !

i started watching in reruns and the more i watched , the more i liked ! now , it is the only show premiering post -1990 that i watch regularly . although that 70 show mimics some of the styles , attitudes , music , and tastes of the 70 , it does not mire itself in that decade by going overboard with the references and look of the 70 . it contains so much funny , witty , biting dialogue that is delivered with confidence and certainty by its main cast that it overcomes any 70 clichs by just being humorous . the humor is what keeps the show eternally watchable . although a hilarious sitcom , no matter what time period , the uniqueness of mocking the 70 does work in its favor as it gives the show a signature identity . but its the focus on universal issues family problems , teen angst , marital issues , peer pressure , dealing with all of them with comic aplomb , that gives the show a mass appeal . the show's center is one eric forman played to absolute comic perfection by future superstar topher grace . eric is a super skinny , geeky looking , non athletic teen and still comes off as super cool due to grace's brilliant self deprecation of the character . eric has 5 friends donna , hyde , kelso , jackie , and fez played respectively in hilarious fashion by laura prepon , danny masterson , ashton kutcher , mila kunis , and wilmer valderama . we get to see life in point place , wisconsin through the eyes of these 6 teens and boy do we get a lot to see ! donna , a forward thinking feminist , is the object of eric's affection and these 2 have the core relationship of the show . they become a couple pretty soon after the show starts and they are never a boring couple . most of the shows eps end with them having a meaningful conversation about them and their future and it works as a great insightful bookend , which works as a perfect counter to the prior hilarity . hyde is eric's best friend and soon moves in with the formans when his mother abandons him ; hyde is the mellow , zen , cool one of the group and just sits back , observes , and makes fun of his fellow friends with easygoing aplomb . kelso is the dumb one of the group and kutcher plays it the absolute hilt , displaying amazing physical comedy as well as telling some of the most absurdly hilarious ideas and stories ever ! jackie , who starts out as kelso's girlfriend , is a verbose , self absorbed debutante cheerleader and is at first only accepted as part of the group b / c of kelso , but she manages to ingratiate herself to the point where they all have to accept her ! and finally , fez ! fez is the foreign exchange student from some unknown country we never know exactly where and he is a scene stealer ! i said good day ! you son of a b tch ! valderama is only sporting a foreign accent here as he hasn not one in reality and he is always in character and creates one of the most unique characters i have ever seen . his scene stealing moments often help make the show for me . the show constantly takes us into the minds and thoughts of these characters through engaging fantasy scenes of how they would like or imagine things to be . the gang repeatedly gets into trouble most of it on purpose . they constantly play gags on the point place residents as well as each other . they hang out most of the time in eric's basement plotting , pontificating , or just plain playing around . also figuring prominently in the show are eric's parents , the menacing , commie hating red and the lovable , happy go lucky kitty played memorably by kurtwood smith and debra jo rupp . these 2 adults give the show a much needed mature point of view and constantly berate and advise the 6 ne er do wells . red and kitty are ably supported by donna's parents , the buffoonish bob played wonderfully for the full run by don stark and blonde bimbo daft midge the super sexy tanya roberts , who was on the show for about half it's run . additionally , for 3 full seasons , eric's sister from hell laurie played brilliantly by the wickedly sexy farrah fawcett lookalike lisa robin kelly was a major refreshing relief to counter the shenanigans of the main 6 and to be the thorn in eric and her parents sides ! kelly came back as a guest character for a few season 5 eps . but , unfortunately , kelly's personal problems led to her being replaced by a terrible new actress in season 6 the newbie didn not last , thankfully , and was gone after a few season 6 eps ! sadly , at the end of season 7 topher grace eric and early in season 8 ashton kutcher kelso left the show and it never recovered as season 8 turned out to be it's la st grace and kutcher returned for the series finale , though , giving the show a satisfying end . a lot of great supporting and cameo characters would help keep the show fresh through added nostalgia and humor . top notch supporting players were eternally high leo played to the hilt by tommy chong , pastor dave , roy the terrific comic jim gaffigan , big rhonda , mitch , earl , etc they also got legends marion ross happy days and betty white the mary tyler moore show to play red and kitty's mothers , respectively . many celebrity cameos from the 70 made appearances as well , from shirley jones partridge family to pamela sue martin nancy drew to charo to ted nugent to k . i . s . s ! it goes on and on ! with great nostalgic 70 homages and references , hilarious dialogue and delivery and a nonsensical , take no prisoners style of comedic storytelling , that 70 show is a television classic !

2			none	good	writing	solid	heart	strong	sequences	great	fluidity	great	none	bad	raya	young	characters	strong			saw this movie twice at community screenings and really loved it . i work in the jane finch community and feel the film really captured some of the essence and flavour of the community grit , determination , exuberance , creativity , in your faceness with a dose of desperation . the writing , dialogue and acting is solid and i really found myself drawn into the story of the young woman raya as she struggles to pursue her goals and not lose herself in the process . great dance sequences and it is not only the bodies that move smoothly and with electricity but the camera moves with great fluidity and intelligence as well . all the characters are multi dimensional none wholly good or bad and the women characters are admirably strong . this is a film that has a strong beating heart and celebrates the irrepressible spirit of youth , hip hop and communities like jane finch .
2			effort	best	thing	single	rest	well	name	famous	performances	exceptional	looks	beautiful	story	true no	film	best	performance	natural	score	fine	direction	ordinary			based on fact , this is the story of a teenager named homer hickam jake gyllenhaal , growing up in a coal town in west virginia where a boy's usual destiny was to end up in the mines . but homer had his eye on the sky and a love for flying rockets , to the dismay of his mine foreman father , and the consternation of the townsfolk generally . a misfit for sure , he and three of his equally outcast buddies begin making rockets , which they fly from a patch of barren land eight miles out of town , so as to no longer terrorize the community with their oft times errant rockets . unfortunately , most of the town and especially homer's father chris cooper thinks that they are wasting their time . however , the people become intrigued and soon start coming out in droves to watch the rocketboys send off their homemade missiles . only one teacher laura dern in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize . now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars . director joe johnston has always been a famous name for his movies such as jumanji & jurassic park 3 & october sky surely stands above all of his other fil ms without any doubts , october sky is his best effort & obviously his best film . it's not only a true story filmed extremely well , but even as a movie , it has every single thing , which is required for a top level cinema . and along with johnston's extra ordinary direction , are some exceptional performances . jake gyllenhaal was around 19 when this movie was released & he gives a beautiful & natural performance . he is a perfect actor . chris cooper as his father , also gives a very fine performance . the same goes for laura dern & also she looks beautiful . even the rest of the performances are extremely well . the background score was fine . highly inspiring movie , which lifts up your spirit sky high . one of those movies which definitely inspires you for all of your life . an amazing inspiring movie along with loads of entertainment . not to be missed .
2			grass	dry	it	exciting	it	worth			good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds . lots of tough guys throughout ; cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type . several holes appeared in the picture , but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing . one really dumb scene shows heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire . to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo . the grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let er rip ?
2			movie	good	movie	hate	something	mixed	something	exotic	fan	big	addition	necessary no			i must admit the only reason i bought this movie was because i am a big fan of gackt and a huge fan of hyde . i was expecting a good movie with a lot of shots that were , shall we say , pleasing to the feminine eye but a slightly cheesy story . i mean , the synopsis sounded really out there . and now that i have just finished watching it i feel the need to tell the world of its brilliance ! hyde and gackt both gave heart wrenching performances , and my eyes are still hot from the crying that lasted throughout the last half of the movie . you get sucked into the story , and you really feel for the characters by the end . the element of vampirism which i love , but is very easy to overdo or to ruin a movie with is subtly mixed into the storyline as to make it something merely exotic , normal to this setting , rather than a random unnecessary addition to the story . i ranked it at a 9 out of 10 at then i went back and tried to think of why i wasn not giving it that last point . came up with nothing . so a ten out of ten it is . after all i m not much of a critic the fact that i m bothering to write a review at all means i either really hate the movie or really love it . you can tell what side i m on with moon child .
2			you	wrong	mcintire	excellent	respect	due	mann	good			another very good mann flick thanks to the father / son combination of walter brennan and jimmy stewart . brennan ben tatum is often the comedic conscience of either stewart or wayne red river / rio bravo . he's there to see that the younger man takes the ride fork or bend . you are wrong mr dunston . jeff webster stewart gives off the impression he cares only for himself but it is clear he cannot desert brennan . john mcintire is excellent as the law of skagway with due respect for the trappings of justice over the reality of it . another key theme is helping people and in turn being helped by people . the loner can do neither and suffers for it . the caption above plays on tatum's assertion that he can not live without his coffee . this nicotine addiction proves fatal . probably the first and last time on the screen . i recommend this film and now own the dvd .
2			things	best	rolls	strong	audio	hard	audio	fair	movie	entire			i have , things to come , on d . v . d . and it's very clear compared to my vhs version . the audio is fair , but can be hard to understand at times . i liked the movie so much that i searched for a copy of the book and found gave details of why some things happened . the best things about the movie are the small things that i didn not notice at fir st such as , john cabal playing with a toy airplane at a christmass party , like it was a dive bomber , out dateing sea power by naming a battleship , dinosuar . ships sunk by air power , an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes . swept flying wing planes . strong rolls for the women through the entire movie . there are more , see the movie to enjoy them .
2			insulting	weak	story	true	it	enjoyable	plan	great	dealers	big	fact	insulting			the true story of a bunch of junkies robbing a not so honest businessman of drugs , jewelry , guns , and money . some would say this is the tragic tale of america in the excessive eighties where the high of the peace and free love sixties had crashed into drugs and aids . honestly , this is just regular people with no aim in life who sit around getting high and decide to rob a ruthless man . what is the second part of their master plan ? once they have his will sit around and get high again . great plan . even if you don not know the story , there is no suspense in this movie and no surprises . the fact that cox tries to make some kind of folk heroes out of these characters , with party scenes and a montage of their loot , is weak and insulting . the story was better off with a more straight forward approach . as it is , this is just a sad story of small time drug dealers getting killed by big time drug dealers . the bigger story , in more ways than one , is john holmes . he is the center of this story anyway . this movie should have been all about him , his life . he was the one in wonderland , with the wonders about to fade away . ps although it isn not official , boogie nights is a better version of holmes life . it isn not entirely factual , but it's far more enjoyable .
2			people	real	thing	hard	it	available no	masterpiece	real			i have been trying to find out about this series for ages ! thank you , imdb ! i saw this as a child and have never quite been able to get it out of my mind . as a 6 year old , of course , i was particularly struck by the episode of the cyclops , which was absolutely chilling i talked about it so much that my older brother made me a cyclops out of a plastic cave man figurine , which i still have what i also remember , though , was the atmosphere , which was unusual right from the beginning mysterious , austere , and extremely authentic . when i read the original many years later i experienced that same sensation . it's a very hard thing to capture and probably impossible in hollywood . every odyssey i have seen since has been an enormous let down . the characters in this series seemed genuine , real people ancient greek people and not some hollywood stars in costumes . this is a real masterpiece ! but why is it not better known ? and why isn not it available on vhs or dvd ? i would just love to have the chance to see this again !
2			buildup	nice	victims	potential	change	nice	scene	famous	comedy	romantic	seems	complicated	jackson	complicated	it	unexpected	thrill	great			i didn not want this to get complicated , leese . i have to assume she's gonna read that . fear takes flight at 30 000 feet in this taut , action thriller . an overnight flight to miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when lisa rachel mcadams realizes her seatmate cillian murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot . as the minutes tick by , she's in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late . one of the many reasons i love this movie , is because of the chemistry between the two stars , mcadams and murphy , who are also two of my top favorite actors . for example , the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other . i got to hand it to the two as well , for making a film like this work . especially , murphy's character . jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent , yet he's trying to do his job and make lisa feel trapped physically and mentally . i mean , in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for lisa . a great thrill ride all the way through . a lot of films i would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about , but actually i wouldn not mind a prequel to this one , which would take place with jackson surveilling lisa . favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene , because it was so unexpected . there was also that nice buildup to the famous pen scene . when is she going to make her move ? there was also that nice change in mcadam's lisa , where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back . i also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court . how great was murphy with his whole weezing . .
2			effort	terrible	world	entire	luck	great	one	impressive	part	appealing	help	generous	reporter	hysterical	event	terrible	danger	big	release	international	segment	good	suspicion	terrible	york	new	segments	different	episodes	great	end	happy	one	real	things	good	segment	best	nair	strange			it was clear right from the beginning that 9 11 would inspire about as many films as world war ii and vietnam combined ; however , there is certainly a big danger that most of these films to come are about as good or rather bad as pearl harbor . it is a great luck that the first international release about 9 11 is not a cheesy love story starring a bunch of pretty faces , but a collective work of 11 directors from the entire world . i m not intending to say that all 11 episodes are great youssef chahine's , for example , has a needless prologue with too many cuts and shohei imamura's has a really bizarre ending or that the segments are in the right order imamura's , being the only one not referring directly to the twin towers , should open the film , not end it , alejandro gonzales inarritu's should be the last one instead , as it's the most impressive one . but it is an impressing effort and an interesting portrayal of the way other parts of the world react to the collapse of the twin towers . consider samira makhmalbaf's opening segment , in which an afghan teachers tries to explain to her pupils what happened in new york and unsuccessfully suggests a one minute silence . or idrissa ouedraogo's part which features a bin laden double so much resembling the real one that you will be shocked when you see him , i promise , in which 5 boys muse about good things that can be done with the reward put out on laden . there's a surprisingly good and extremely angry segment by ken loach about a man from chile talking about what he calls our tuesday september 11 that september 11 in 1973 when their elected president allende was killed and pinochet installed his dictatorship with the generous help from henry kissinger and the cia . this could have become a terrible effort in anti americanism , but it did become a sad tale and shares my recognition for the best segment with inarritu's mainly sound impressions and phone calls from the hijacked planes to a black screen , sometimes a few pictures of people falling down the wtc and finally a collapsing tower , ending with the screen brightening up and one question appearing and amos gitai's about a hysterical reporter trying desperatly to get on air after a car bomb exploded in tel aviv hard to recognize , but this one is a masterpiece of choreography . all these different segments i haven not mentioned yet claude lelouch's about a deaf girl , danis tanovic's about a demonstration of the women of srebrenica , mira nair's strange , but it takes an indian director to make the part that is probably most appealing to western tastes about a muslim family whose son is under a terrible suspicion after 9 11 and sean penn's with ernest borgnine yes , ernest borgnine as a widower leading the most depressive life one can imagine add up to a unique film not easy to watch and hard to forget . i am sure this film will be a classic known to everyone thirty years from now . i hope it will be remembered for starting a long tradition of world cinema movies . but , alas , it's far more probable it will be remembered as a one film only effort . and as the one of the few 9 11 movies made by then that don not reduce this terrible event to a love story with a happy end just to please the audience .

2			gem	true	laughs	great			paul hennessy and his wife , cate must deal with their two teenage daughters and weird after the untimely passing of john ritter , the show became more about coping with the loss of a loved one . i found this show , passing through the channels one afternoon and i have to say i was laughing myself till my ribs ached , simply at the range of characters ; the witty lines and the situation paul would find himself dealing mostly with his then on , i caught the rest of the show when i was free and i have to say the writing was very then i read about john ritter's death . shortly afterwards i watched goodbye part 2 and i have to say i was nearly in tears , watching the emotions of the characters , losing a loved rory punches a wall in anger and cate deals with having to sleep in her bed all alone . briget and kerry talking about what they should have done . but the show does move on , bringing with it jim egan and cj barnes who provide great laughs , as cate's father tries to protect his family and give man issue talks to the true gem is is absolutely hilarious as the wild cousin . it will always be john ritter's masterpiece .
2			humor	good	scenes	hearted	b	glorious	it	bad	scenes	best	use	little	gathering	social	moments	finest	man	alive	performances	best			errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john sullivan ward bond went around claiming that he could beat any man alive . both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen . raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style , capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm hearted and full of good humor . all the warner contract players make up the fine cast including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father , proud of his son's fighting abilities , and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one liners dealing with his conceited manners . all of the 1880 atmosphere is captured in glorious b&w , although it's too bad warners didn not have more faith in flynn to do the film in color . he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time , engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out . the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen , with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action . and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor . summing up maintains interest all the way through , whether you are a sports fan or not .

2			seem	real	organization	foolish	film	entire			this installment very much makes the cia look like a very foolish organization . in reality , perhaps they are . after all , the way the plot goes on this it very much looks like one man has the power to sanction killing everyone including his own people in order to kill jason bourne . matt damon does a very credible job as bourne trying to stay one step ahead of being killed the entire film . he is still trying to remember who he was & how he has gotten where he is . he gets help from a couple of folks & it seems like every minute of the film , somebody is trying to kill him . there is little time for rest in this film & the action sequences seem very very real . there are a lot of chase sequences filmed with the shaky cam which in a way add to the realism & make it seem less hollywood than many pictures . these sequences add realism to the film in feeling . the suspense in some of the sequences is brilliantly done as you wonder if someone is going to die or if bourne can head them off . this is the kind of action suspense you go to see when you want to be entertained & i am sure this one will lead to the next film in the series .

of course andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with morning rise don not ask , and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex . when it's first discovered andy is a virgin , at 40 his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers david paul rudd , jay romany malco and cal seth rogen all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman , which couldn not be any further from the truth . the truth is , andy loves women , but past traumatic experiences revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence have put him on the sidelines for good . david , jay , and cal each embark on a mission to get andy laid , so help them all . but you know that such escapades will only end in disaster , as proved by one date with nicky leslie mann , who puts andy through the worst drunk driving experience i think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with beth elizabeth banks , the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend . things brighten up for andy when he meets trish catherine keener , the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on ebay for people . hmmm . and with that nice looking collection of action figures , you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him , that is if he can ever do the deed . at last , this is the sex romp we have been waiting for . it deals with a very real issue a lot of lonely guys probably go through , not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture how many of us lonely guys want to be a lonely guy forever ? the important thing we are taught in this picture is that lonely guy must be himself . i don not think he needs to go through body waxing like andy does which is side splitting to be honest , and according to this website and various other news articles , was in fact real , and so was the blood on carell's shirt afterward . the 40 year old virgin was directed by judd apatow and co written by himself and carell , which originated as a skit that starred carell . carell is sweet and human , as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut . this is probably one of the most intelligent romps i have ever seen and is not offensive a whole lot because its characters are treated with dignity and respect . even carell's buddies , who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities , can be related to on a fundamental level . the way the 40 year old virgin plays out is indeed funny in the end , but i will leave that up to you , the viewer , to observe . surely , if anyone can go through the things andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as catherine keener , then it's true it is never too late ! 10 10

2			answers	funny	jokes	subtle	racy	little	them	thin	people	good	series	old	smells	different			with films like wallace & gromit and chicken run under their belt , the good people from the other side of the pond , aardman animation , are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of creature comforts . derived from a short done early in their careers , creature comforts is a slice of life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort . aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as , are you a liar ? and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives . the answers , while seeming to be boring and mundane , are actually quite funny , when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later . how many of these animals look like the person making the statements ? one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman , i like them kind of thin . is an insect , the walking stick . there are two dogs discussing odors and smells , while sniffing the behind of a poodle , as they talk about the different smells of a woman . there are two birds in a cage . as the wife tells the litany that is her health , her long suffering husband stands by her , saying nothing . while it might take some time for creature comforts to find it's legs , it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary . while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills , creature comforts is one of a kind and definitely worth watching . some of the humor might seem a little racy , it's the claymation that catches the attention of the children like the old batman series of the 60 s , the jokes are subtle enough the kids won not get them and it's the jokes that are there for the adults .
2			errors	serious	basis	daily	brutality	gross	expectations	low	ambiguity	moral	means	eventual	side	wrong	texan	rich	need	powerful	nature	troubled	model	successful	attempts	various	andrews	new			new york police detective mark dixon dana andrews is a guy who has to deal with his own demons on a daily basis at the same time as coping with the normal ups and downs of everyday life . the strain produced by his internal struggle and his intense hatred of criminals , leads him to make serious errors of judgement and to fail to recognise the need for any code of conduct to be adhered to in his dealings with people on the wrong side of the law . he has a track record of treating suspects and known criminals with gross brutality and this has brought him into conflict with his superior officers who have censured him for the amount of violence he has regularly used . dixon cannot reconcile these calls for restraint with his own extreme and irrational hatred of all criminals . he is tormented by the fact that his father was a criminal and has been left with a powerful need to live down his father's reputation and to avoid fulfilling the low expectations that many people have of him as a consequence . when a rich texan is murdered following an evening's gambling run by gangster tommy scalise gary merrill , dixon is assigned to the case . scalise tells dixon's superior officer detective lieutenant thomas karl malden that the victim had been accompanied by ken paine craig stevens and his wife morgan gene tierney and that paine had committed the murder . dixon goes to paine's apartment and questions the suspect who is both inebriated and uncooperative and when paine punches him , dixon retaliates and paine collapses and dies . dixon goes on to dispose of the body in a nearby river . paine's wife is questioned and after describing what had happened at scalise's place , adds that her father had gone to paine's apartment later that night to take issue with him about the fact that she would returned home with facial bruising . paine had previously attacked her on a number of occasions and her father , jiggs taylor tom tully , had threatened that if it happened again he would beat paine up . this information leads to taylor being arrested and charged with murder . nobody accepts dixon's explanation that scalise had killed the texan and then had paine killed to eliminate him as a witness . dixon continues to make various attempts to get scalise convicted but eventually realises that the only way to successfully achieve his goal is to write a confession about his own role in paine's death and the cover up . he does this and also records that he is going alone to confront scalise so that the police can arrest the gangster for dixon's murder . the confrontation with scalise and the eventual means by which dixon achieves his own redemption , provide a tense and fitting conclusion to this gritty thriller . dana andrews strained and preoccupied expressions convey his character's perpetually troubled nature and his anxieties as he deals with a series of misfortunes which include and follow paine's accidental death . dixon , however , isn not the only one to experience misfortune as morgan , a successful model loses her job because of all the trouble surrounding her . her father , who would some years earlier been awarded a diploma for assisting the police , unjustly finds himself charged with a crime he did not commit . ken paine who would been a war hero had experienced unemployment and a loss of self esteem which led to alcoholism and wife beating and scalise who would been set up in business by dixon's father also suffers his own misfortunes . where the sidewalk ends is a thoroughly engaging tale involving a group of interesting and diverse characters and a main protagonist who is the absolute personification of moral ambiguity .

2			role	famous	nomination	best	belly	big	sequel	forgettable	friend	best	oscar	best	performances	single			the late dudley moore had the most famous role of his too short career in 1981 s arthur , a raucously funny and alternately touching tale that generates warm smiles , big belly laughs , and an occasional tear if you are in the right mood . moore received a best actor oscar nomination for his performance as arthur bach , a drunken playboy who races cars , plays tennis , fondles women , but he has weekends off and he's his own boss . arthur is destined to inherit 750 million dollars when he marries a snooty society girl named susan johnston jill eikenberry who is the spoiled daughter of an undercover gangster . things get sticky when arthur meets linda morolla liza minnelli a waitress / struggling actress from queens who steals neckties for her father's birthday . moore lights up the screen in one of the single funniest performances of the last 50 years . the late sir john gielgud won a best supporting actor oscar for his flawless turn as arthur's acid tongued butler and best friend , hobson , whose outward disdain for arthur's behavior covers more paternal feelings . there are other funny contributions by barney martin as linda's father . stephen elliott as susan's father , and geraldine fitzgerald as arthur's demented grandmother . the film was directed with a keen eye for comedy by a first time director named steve gordon , who , sadly , died the following the year . there was also a forgettable sequel several years later , but this instant classic is not to be missed .
2			reception	poor	song	memorable	life	real	music	limited	i	sorry	music	good			i am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film which i first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently . in my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the european sense of humour than to for example the american maybe we in europe can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more , since we are closer to some of them in real life ! particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song it's a fine , fine night , which was issued separately on an hmv 78 pm record 10 inch plum label , i think ! in the fifties . i would urge anyone interested to give it a try if you get the chance you may have a pleasant surprise .

2			aspects	important	aspects	historical	states	united	job	great			i wouldn not be surprised if soderbergh was pressured to avoid making pre revolution cuba as graphically corrupt as it was . merely reciting a few statistics isn not going to make it with the younger crowd . still , part one , which is almost entirely shot in the jungle , does capture the feel of that place , especially when traversing the mountainous areas of cuba . i liked del toro's interpretation of che guevara's personality . and the actor who plays castro , bichir , also did a great job , against all odds . it's clear soderbergh doesn not look down on these people , but it's also clear he's not going to plea their case to yanquis far removed from the recent pa st some of the more important historical aspects contradict what i have read . to my knowledge castro did not court the soviet union until all attempts to gain acceptance from the united states were exhausted . but on other aspects he is right on , especially as to the looting by the expatriates as the island went other rebel control . the country's treasury was left empty .
2			talents	local	beam	constant	work	shoddy	composer	exceptional	writing	superb			i would just like to state that this may be biased , as i am a producer on the film . however , i will maintain some sense of dignity . the star of the film , oscar ovies , gives a stellar performance as jeff grinderlin , a nebbish hypochondriac who spends more time worrying than living . he brings a certain touch to his character that really allows the audience to connect with him , by stating his mind often and with a sense of harsh comedy . his mother , played by christine haber , is the constant support beam , that without , he would crumble upon himself . his friends also lend a hand in jeff's life , often making choices for him rather than letting him use his free will . which often times he neglects is there anyway . the writing is superb , and the conversations flow like scenes from a kevin smith movie , with half as much ben affleck boo hoo fests . the camera work is a little shoddy at some points , and the sound could also use a boost , however the performances out shine the minor details . it is also backed by a beautiful soundtrack with local talents and an exceptional composer . all in all , this was a treat . a rare gem , among many jewels .

2			movie	good	regard	little	story	available	library	sad	movie	available			absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch . i highly recommend this movie . her performance , in my opinion , was academy award material ! the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn not seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format , whether it be tape or dvd . they are ignoring a very good movie . but universal has little regard for its library on dvd , which is sad . if you get the chance to see this somewhere not sure why it is rarely even run on cable , see it ! i won not go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film , and too many reviewers spend hours writing about the story , which is available anywhere . a 10
2			movie	best	lines	stupid	movies	greatest			this is one of the greatest child pet movies ever created . i cry every time i see shadow yelling wait , wait for me peter ! as the family car is pulling away . this is a must see if you love animals ! best movie ever ! the lines in the movie are sometimes stupid . like when sassy says to chance ; cat's rule and dogs drool ! lines like this i could do without , but when i was six i bet i loved that line . the storyline may seem hooky to some , but i like it . shadow as the older dog who's preparing chance to take over for him when he's gone is really moving when you think about it . it reminded me of my childhood dog . i think everyone can find a piece of themselves in homeward bound .
2			showdown	inevitable	deal	great	nature	spontaneous	production	imaginative			a well made and imaginative production , refreshingly free from clich , this somewhat picaresque affair recounts a tale of a close friendship that develops between a man and a boy under less than ideal conditions the man an escaped convict who has kidnapped the youth for his value as a hostage . expertly directed by alan gibson with a fine sense for balanced narrative movement , the film provides freshness in nearly every scene , as felon martin steckert richard harris , believing that his rejection for parole was particularly undeserved , contrives a convoluted but ultimately successful escape plan , following which his spontaneous nature comes to the fore as he flees to the lakeside residence of his childhood . often bursting into song or dancing a few steps , the capricious steckert gradually gains the trust and affection of his captive and , as police close in for an inevitable showdown , the tethered pair are seen to be a great deal alike in their responses to forms of rejection , as discerned by a psychiatrist lindsay wagner assigned to aid a zealous police lieutenant james coburn who is in charge of the manhunt for steckert and his prisoner . this is an engrossing story , worth telling , a quickly paced and novel adventure that profits from a capital performance by harris , fine turns from wagner , coburn , and karen black , along with justin henry as the snatched lad , with an appropriately whimsical score contributed by wilfred josephs , and top notch cinematography by frank watts , with all footage shot in a beautiful autumnal ontario province .
2			use	outstanding	york	new	themes	relevant	injustice	social	power	extraordinary	standing	equal	story	moving	print	good			the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time . stunningly shot , with lighting effects that are truly sublime , this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d . w . griffith and maurice tourneur . how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know , but this film still has extraordinary power . the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york , is very moving . the themes of social injustice , revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today . the use of close ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying . what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema .
2			part	important no	one	alive	transaction	big			recap it's business as usual at louche's casino in tanger . the casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day . the owner louche and some staff leave for the night , leaving modesty in charge . suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino , shooting wildly . unknown to modesty , they have already killed louche , and are now after the money hidden in the vault . but no one present , and still alive , at the casino knows the code to open the vault . the vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants can not blow the door as planned . suddenly modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters leader miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy . comments this is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about modesty blaise , as i have neither seen nor read any of it . the first point i like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified . foremost i thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between modesty and miklos as the main plot . sure , there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story . as already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense filled scene , is the game between modesty and miklos . it's an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character , and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time . someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a tv series , and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such . but , i felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done . i was in no way disappointed in the lack of action , instead i enjoyed this game , the history much more than a simple action movie . i think the two main stars , alexandra staden and nikolaj coaster waldau did very well . staden especially portrays modesty very well , and really carries this confident and talented character . 7 10

2			it	hard	thing	nice	guy	bad	scenes	inventive			it's a colorful slasher movie . that's about it . it has the mystery element that scream made so popular in slasher movies , but i never care for such things . figuring out who's the bad guy is not that interesting considering the clues are all misleading anyway . the death scenes were inventive and gorey , bringing back memories of 80 s horror movies like friday the 13 h . another nice thing about this movie is that it's hard to pinpoint the surviving girl , unlike in scream and ikwydls where it was obvious . people who don not like slasher movies won not like this movie . as simple as that . i truly enjoyed it and i plan to watch it again while waiting for more of the same . mb

2			director	bad	people	former	music	stupid			i love this movie , but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid . the fateful game took place in 1972 that means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 but almost all of the music played at the dances etc is from the 1950 and very early 1960 . having just attended my 30 h high school reunion , i can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents music . i understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970 music we all know what a desolate time it was musically . but it wasn not completely bereft , and the producers of the film should have taken more care . i found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film . this was a bad director and / or producer decision .
2			it	good	it	annoying	bombadil	old	job	miserable	way	different	i	happy	gandalf	excellent	weren	old no	bits	little	songs	bad	friend	old			as an animated film from 1978 this is pretty good generally well above the standard of the days when disney hadn not done anything good in years and tolkien cared little for disney anyway . it gets major points for innovative and careful camera work , applying cinematic techniques with relative success . the much maligned rotoscoping actually works pretty well , especially with the ringwraiths , and the opening narration . however , it is so drastically overused possibly as a money saving technique that it detracts from the overall effect . the same technique that makes wraiths spooky and otherworldly doesn not fare so well in the prancing pony . as for the adaptation of the story , it's actually quite good . we lose little bits here and there , minor details such as the old forest and tom bombadil , the gaffer and the sackville bagginses . we compress a few characters , such as revising legolas as one of elrond's household and an old friend of aragorn's , but that's a rather wise decision for film . in books you have room to include the references to the larger world of the elves and middle earth's vast history . in film , you trade that for visuals and sound that convey the same elements in a different way . nothing critical is truly lost here , and although i have minor quibbles about some of the changes , i m generally pretty happy with it . if only the dratted writers had managed to remember saruman's name he's frequently referred to as aruman , a decision probably made to make him more distinct from similarly named sauron ; it took me a second viewing before i was certain i hadn not misheard it . it's also annoying that boromir is a bloody stage viking , and irritable from the start . however , gandalf is excellent , and most of the rest of the voicework is excellent . if only john hurt weren not too old to play aragorn ; i love his voice . of course , with the film ending at the midpoint of the story , there's a vast disappointment built in . what makes it far , far worse is the altogether miserable job done by the rankin & bass crew on the sequel . that they were permitted to do return of the king after butchering the hobbit remains a huge mystery ; they seem more interested in bad songs than in proper storytelling . for all its faults , this film's heart is solidly in place and it tries very hard to accomplish a nearly impossible task . i can only hope that the upcoming series of films keeps as true to its vision .

2			movie	good	serious	real	quirks	little	awakening	serious	story	different	versions	good	friend	new	interpretation	true	emma	best	person	remarkable	version	good			this is the best emma in existence in my opinion . having seen the other version 1996 which is also good , and read the book , i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece . the 1996 movie with paltrow is good too , it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether . it's very light and fluffy , you don not see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie , that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points , such as the churchill / fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non existent . but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit , more real and multidimensional , the 1996 tv version is the superior . emma is a remarkable person , but she is flawed . kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character . you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith , yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending . you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own ai ms for emma , it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage . for frank churchill , it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret . in the book , she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made . both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like , selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult . both versions are very good but i prefer this one .

2			direction	poetic	girl	rich			i fell in love with emily watson in breaking the waves , then grew even more fascinated by her range and adeptness in hilary and jackie . now comes this stunning portrayal of a rich girl who spurns breeding and convention in favor of mothering the tortured soul of the child of a man clearly in need of mothering . her eyes are the mirror to his soul and what gentle and beautiful eyes they are . those who take things literally will find marleen gorris poetic and allegorical direction quite frustrating . romantics who are willing to go with the amazing kinetic energy is this filmed allegorical poem will be well rewarded .

2			judge	best no	she	funny			jane austen would definitely approve of this one ! gwyneth paltrow does an awesome job capturing the attitude of emma . she is funny without being excessively silly , yet elegant . she puts on a very convincing british accent not being british myself , maybe i m not the best judge , but she fooled was also excellent in sliding doors . i sometimes forget she's american ! also brilliant are jeremy northam and sophie thompson and phyllida law emma thompson's sister and mother as the bates women . they nearly steal the ms law doesn not even have any lines ! highly recommended .
2			person	dead	breck	old	it	interesting	it	entertaining	film	little	opening	gothic	counter	active	history	visual	lugosi	terrific	ray	fun			the third collaboration for karloff and lugosi sees a move away from poe and into the realm of the science fiction serial . karloff plays dr janos rukh , creator of a device that can capture light rays through his telescope in the carpathian mountains and translate them into pictures that form a visual history of the universe . before several guests , including lugosi as dr benet , an astro chemist who had previously scoffed at rukh's theories , he demonstrates the existence of an unknown radioactive element , here termed radium x , contained in a meteor that fell to earth in darkest africa several thousand years ago . karloff joins the expedition to prove his theories , but radium x is a tricky compound it levels mountains at long range , and cures blindness at short range . rukh is careless , however , and poisons himself , glowing in the dark rather like those old ready breck commercials ! dr benet is on hand to devise a counter active for the radiation , but combination of poison and cure drives rukh insanely paranoid . convinced he has been cheated , he seeks out the members of the expedition in paris , including his estranged wife , and his very touch while in his radioactive state means death . along the way we get the old pseudo scientific idea that a dead person's eyes record the image of their killer a remarkably distinct karloff ! and the radium x device used to symbolically melt statues that represent the expedition members . and even a touch of james whale in a cockney landlady in paris ! the invisible ray is great fun , aside from the gothic opening it's interesting to see universal move the action around to africa and paris . the film lacks pace , but is always absorbing . karloff slightly overdoes his performance but lugosi is terrific . universal used the basic story outline again in man made monster , this time with lon chaney jr as the glowing menace this time caused by electricity and lionel atwill as a much madder doctor than lugosi is here . the invisible ray is a sombre and clever little film with much to admire . not as famous as other universal horrors , perhaps , but it works and is highly entertaining .
2			i	glad	budget	low	looks	real	you	glad			i wasn not sure what to expect but am i glad i went to see this . a smart , slightly twisted comedy that makes you think . i wasn not quite sure how a director can create nothing , but leave it to mr natali and the brilliant individuals at c . o . r . e . to create another low budget set that looks real as real as nothing can be . well worth your time and money , if you have the opportunity to see this , please go . you will be glad you did .
2			turn	real	truth	single	people	real	element	thematic	form	highest	quality	excellent	lanquage	original			the key to the joy and beauty , the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we don not constantly struggle against that single compelling truth . in so doing , we find peace . elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp . in this film , the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way . this is a beautiful yet simple story , more of a fable , which is played very well . watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors . i struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it . i m at a loss . the story is about men in a bath house . sounds like a real turn off , right ? but , nothing could be farther from the truth . the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film , which is the bath . i m still at a loss . talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice . so , i will just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was . i was also quite entertained . i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them . for any story , that is the highest form of praise . if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less , then make sure you see the shower . netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent . i watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed english subs .
2			sister	big	animation	modern	scenes	creative	violence	gratuitous	animation	superb			best animated movie ever made . this film explores not only the vast world of modern animation with absolutely boggling effects , but the branches of the human mind , soul , and philosophy . the story features a family of cats , where in the big sister dies , the younger brother sees this and rescues her body , but when she awakens she is left without a soul . so , the two sibling cats embark on a journey to find it . i have related this journey to many things . the history of the world , the bible , the cycle of life , and every time i watch it i discover more and more hidden themes and metaphors . if you aren not so into the physiological aspect of it then , you will still adore it . the animation is superb , and the creative scenes will have you attached to the screen . for example , the ocean freezing in time , god eating soup out of the earth , a strange and slightly snm retelling of hansel and gretel . to conclude , cat soup is an absolute treat for anyone . ps not for kids , gratuitous violence included .

2			success	commercial	courtney	talented	story	great	documentaries	best	failure	successful	job	great	relationship	hate	job	hard	reason	good			anton newcombe and courtney taylor are friends , they both are the leads in their own respective bands ; anton with the brian jonestown massacre and courtney with the dandy warhols . what's interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals ; its a love hate relationship . at times you both hear them praising one another , but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are . while the dandy warhols went on the reach commercial success , bjm still was stuck in the underground scene ; and for good reason why . the focus of dig ! is more towards anton and the bjm , as they have a lot more substance . they are the most dysfunctional band . during gigs they will fight and bash each other . anton will hit other members if he feels they aren not performing correctly . with the amount of drugs an alcohol they consume , fight was always waiting to happen . you know how people go to car races just to see if a huge car crash happens ; that's why people would go to their gigs , for the fights . anton is very unstable . always thinking himself as a music messiah , he wants to change music and create a revolution , but he could never get out of the underground . he is a very talented musician , its amazing how many instruments he can play and with such skill . but his draw back is he cant escape the world he created ; a prolific musician stuck in a black hole drugs , alcohol and depression . on the other side , the dandy warhols were having their own troubles . they didn not find much success with their first album and were constantly fighting with their record label . but they found huge success in europe . but courtney keeps being sucked back into the world of anton . its interesting that both anton and courtney both had what the other needed . courtney always wanted to be musically talented as anton , though anton wouldn not say it , he needed the commercial success that the dandy's had , to make his revolution . over the seven year course the film crew followed these two bands , there is a lot of footage . there is never a dull moment in dig ! it is constantly moving along as it doesn not have time to slow down as it has to much to say , seven years of story telling in the 1 45 ins is a hard job . ondi timoner has done a great job of piecing together one of the best music documentaries that makes you always wanting more . even if you don not like the bands it still deserves viewing ; it transcends the music to reveal a great story of a successful failure . you wont be disappointed .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the appeal of ancient films like this one is that you get to see an actual moving image of life over 100 years ago . here are a lot of people leaving a factory , all of them dead by now and none of them even remotely aware of the magnitude of the invention that they are walking before . i was shocked to read one reviewer call this film as boring as home videos today , and at least one other mistakenly identified it as the first film ever made it was the first film made at the rate of 16 frames per second , rather than the then normal 46 frames per second . sure , all you see is a lot of people filing out of a building and passing before the cinematograph on their way home from work , but this is a curiosity piece for dozens of reasons , not the least of which is that it was the first film made by the lumire brothers , who probably had a stronger impact on the development of the cinema than any other individual or group of individuals in history .

2			plot	simple	it	hate	liners	best	film	fantastic	acting	impressive	caprice	big	characters	best	strip	comic	something	rare	language	bad	movie	amazing			dick tracy is one of my all time favorite fil ms i must admit to those that haven not seen it . you will either really love it or really hate it . it came out a year after the success of batman . so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple . but its based on a comic did you expect ? creatively , this movie is amazing ! the sets , make up , music , costumes , and the impressive acting make this film fantastic . the film has bloodless violence and no bad language that's something rare these days . directed , produced , and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs . madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney . this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played . she has the best one liners i have heard ! madonna fans would love it ! one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip . this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public . to sum things up , this film brings out the child in all of us . it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end .
2			saget	hilarious	character	funny	girls	young	friend	best	character	believable	values	moral	joey	best			i loved this show growing up and i still watch the first season dvd at age 19 today . what can i say ? i grew up in a house much like the one on full house . i had a dad , two sisters , and a dog . i guess the only difference was that i did not live with my uncle and my dad's best friend . also , i grew up with my mom in the house . i don not know what i would have done without full house on television . i think that stephanie played by jodie sweetin , d . j . played by kirk cameron's sister candace , and michelle played by mary kate and ashley olsen are my favorite characters . i can relate to each of them because i am the middle child of my family like steph , i am a younger sister like michelle , and i am an older sister like d . j . i really like how the show always has moral values because i don not really like any of the o . c . like shows today . i like the comedy of full house , too . uncle jesse john stamos , joey dave coulier , and danny bob saget are hilarious as the girls uncle , dad's friend , and dad , respectively . the story goes that , after the girls mom dies , danny's best friend joey and his brother in law , jesse move in to help raise the kids . three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious . each character on full house is full of heart , funny , and genuinely believable . joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid's heart and soul . jesse is the cool , motorcycle riding , tough guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces , and later , his wife becky laurie laughlin , from summerville . both kids and adults will love this show . guaranteed .

2			choices	different	understanding	hard			this movie is one of my favorites because it makes me think of all the choices i have made and how my life would change if my choices had been different . it plays right into the multiple universe theory . the only thing that doesn not ring true is how larry burrows james belushi has such a hard time understanding what is going on , that everything has changed .
2			her	fun	grayson	bland	songs	dull	it	interesting	girl	little	number	hilarious	girl	sweet	story	fictitious	sailors	good			this has some excellent spots but the length of the film can not sustain the wafer thin plot . it is another sailors on leave film , zippier than astaire's follow the fleet but not as good as on the town . kathryn grayson is bland but kelly and sinatra work well together . their if you knew susie number is hilarious as they make up the song as they sing it . i begged her is also fun with sinatra showing how adept he was at hoofing . sinatra's solo songs are dull and seem to be inserted to show off his singing rather than as part of the story . fortunately there are accomplished supporting actors like grady sutton , rags ragland , carlos ramirez and pamela britton and an unlikely but impertubable jose iturbi as himself , to keep one watching . kelly is the star of the film , although third billed and it is interesting to see him interact with children , which astaire never did . dean stockwell plays a child who wants to be in the navy and latches on to the kelly character . he also visit a school resulting in him telling the children a fictitious story of his life in the pomeranian ! navy which leads to his wonderful dance with an animated jerry mouse . in another scene he dances a charming mexican hat dance with a sublimely grave faced little girl , sharon mcmanus , that is entrancing and sweet . very pleasant then but a bit too long . a taster of better musicals to come .

2			conflict	strong	menace	formidable	it	animated	everybody	familiar	charm	essential	gown	gorgeous	numbers	musical	story	predictable			walt disney's cinderella takes a story everybody's familiar with and embellishes it with humor and suspense , while retaining the tale's essential charm . disney's artists provide the film with an appealing storybook look that emanates delectable fairy tale atmosphere . it is beautifully , if conventionally , animated ; the highlight being the captivating scene where the fairy godmother transforms a pumpkin into a majestic coach and cinderella's rags to a gorgeous gown . mack david , al hoffman , and jerry livingston provide lovely songs like a dream is a wish your heart makes and bibbidi bobbidi boo that enhance both the scenario and the characters . even though cinderella's story is predictable , it provides such thrilling melodrama that one shares the concerns and anxieties of the titular heroine and her animal friends . both the wicked stepmother and her dreadful cat lucifer present a formidable menace that threatens the dreams and aspirations of cinderella and the mice . it is this menace that provides the story with a strong conflict that holds the viewers intere st the film's suspense , however , is nicely balanced by a serene sweetness , especially in the musical numbers . it is in these segments that reveal the appealing personalities of cinderella and her friends , moving the viewers to care for them . overall , walt disney's cinderella is wonderful family entertainment that has held up remarkably well after half a century .
2			she	ill	tragedy	romantic	nothing	special	duet	classic	music	golden	pakeezah	least	poetic	serious	film	musical			at last i have finally got round to it and managed to see a clean copy of pakeezah ! up until now i have only had a mangled scratchy jerky version taped off dubai tv sometime in the 90 s , with quirky english subtitles , dizzying widescreen coverage and a fluid colour with a mind of its own . having thought the world of such a poor and short copy i find the decent one was well worth the wait and the full 140 minutes even more of a pleasure than i thought possible . this was the lovely meena kumari's film from start to finish , and i believe was planned by her from 1958 on , finally realising it in 1971 what a shame it was that chronic alcoholism finally killed her soon afterwards , and in fact that she was too ill to perform in some of the scenes in pakeezah , necessitating a body double . in some scenes the strain definitely shows in her face . the story of purity versus adversity i can only treat as fiction having no experience of anything remotely close to it , but i m led to understand that it faithfully depicts a world now gone that must have been common at one time in india . it's a sparkling and colourful film with a simple relentless epic message , an intense romantic tragedy which is somehow simultaneously feelgood too . but to me it's the peerless golden music by ghulam mohammed as sung by the incomparable lata mangeshkar especially thare rahiyo and its part in the unfolding of the story that makes this film so outstanding . i have seldom heard such serious , beautiful , poetic , wondrously sung and played songs on any movie soundtrack . singin in the rain may be my favourite musical film but pakeezah has my favourite music yet lata said that the songs themselves meant nothing special to her . the only pity is that the also unique mohammed rafi only had the one song in here , albeit a classic duet with lata . because of all this but not blind to its faults , pakeezah is my favourite indian movie , filmed at a time when the westernisation of india was gathering pace and watched now when western values seem to be state sponsored and de rigueur . at the very least watch pakeezah for a taste of what indian pop music had to offer the world before it was all jettisoned for drum machines , the bollywood beat and bhangra .

2			it	accurate no	problem	real	i	glad	it	difficult			i don not know what it is with this movies . but movies about history or religion are always criticised by their accuracy . of course it's not 100 accurate . it's difficult to make 100 accurate films nowadays when even the experts disagree with each other . therefore i rather like to judge a movie by what it is trying to say than pick on all the inaccuracies . so i start by saying that i liked this mini serie . but i do agree with the critique that his childhood years went by too fa st the series should have been a three part story , his childhood being the first part . but if they didn not have more money to shoot more story who am i to criticise that ? ? there's only one real problem i have with this movie and that's the fact that it's told in a history book way . especially the second part which is just a sum of events that happened . i rather would have liked to see hitler more humane more scenes where he doubts himself etc . noah taylor did that more in the movie max which seem to work better i think . nevertheless i m glad this was made and own it on dvd . just to remember more vividly what happened and see carlyle giving his be st 7.5 10

2			hammer	poor	budget	low	psychiatrist	mysterious	contribution	solid	line	famous	hammer	old			i love this film . the noir imagery combined with spillane's no nonsense character mike hammer works marvellously to create a mood and feel seldom found in low budget detective films of the early fifties . it may not be not he maltese falcon but this film makes it's own solid contribution to the genre . spillane is often criticised for alleged misogyny etc , but his would ames are way above their male counterparts in terms of cunning and intelligence . poor old mike hammer , as effectively played by biff elliott , is blinded by the beauty of the mysterious psychiatrist whom he meets when investigating the death of an army buddy . when the penny finally drops his face is a picture . good to see that 50 censorship did not force the film makers to omit the famous last line . a bona fide low budget classic .
2			rest	bad	dialog	good	scene	memorable			this is one of those westerns that , well , stands practically alone in the unrelieved quality of its dialog . very few can hold up to it over the long haul . that said , the rest is pretty bad . nevertheless i am giving it an eight because there is no other western with such consistently good dialog with maybe the exception of the wild bunch , junior bonner , and perhaps a few more . it is riddled with weaknesses , john drew barrimore the most glaring . however it does have one truly memorable scene . nothing like it . its right after kid wichita kills the sheriff , and goes to jack elams place trying to goad him into a fight . wonderful stuff . right up with the best in any western .

2			seats	comfortable no	sound	brilliant	them	amusing			my first fassbinder was a wonderful experience . film and alternative cinema small hall , with uncomfortable seats ; public had to wait while filmrolls were changed were perfect match . there were many cliches used in the film , but fassbinder presented them so cleverly that i found them really amusing . sound was also brilliant sometimes back being louder than dialogue . everything seemed to be in right place . and i loved the way how after war time was presented . real fun !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			this movie of 370 minutes was aired by the italian public television during the early seventies . it tells you the myth attributed to homer of the journey home of odysseus after the troy war . it is an epic story about the ancient minoan and mycenaean civilizations , told at list 500 years after those events toke place , around 1100 bc . this is a 1969 movie , so if you buy the dvd version you would find that the sound is just mono and there is no other language than italian , even the close caption is in italian . pity . many people would enjoy this masterpiece if it had at list the english subtitles . but if this is not a problem for you , than i would strongly recommend to watch this movie .

2			guys	bad	busey	entire	show	entire	title	decent			guns blasting , buildings exploding , cars crashing , and that's just the first ten minutes . this action packed film involving a rogue ex cia mercenary who can not seem to die no matter how many times he's shot hence the title is pretty decent . tough and toothy gary busey , usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks , has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued after all he's carrying the entire show . which doesn not mean there isn not a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith , luke askew , mills watson , r . g . armstrong , henry silva , lincoln kirkpatrick , thalmus rasulala , and several other forgotten character actors . there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story busey has to free a group of kidnapped american military elites and return a high tech supertank a normal tank with a cheesy add on pasted to the top back to the states . but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys ? this question is asked , of course , like in any film centering on the cia . but without getting preachy .
2			love	obsessive	movie	powerful	irritating	little	presentation	visual	opposition	furious	role	contemporary	one	dead	ahead	little	brooks	live	jumps	little			a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise . placed at the beginning of talkies , prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full on silent film which is still is at heart and flirting with sound and sound effects . the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn not help it at all . hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach , for example , is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance . other than that , the movie rolls along more or less well , with little jumps in continuity here and there something quite common in films from this era and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents . in a way , this is an experiment of a movie , and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level . louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for she's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend . her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time ; the last of the flapper / jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now , with the onset of female independence , women as professionals were being represented in film . that brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time . however , her character's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn not there that her boyfriend wants her to succeed and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre . this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in the man who knew too much and cuts from brooks , her image on screen , and the murderous boyfriend . even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live brooks with the now dead one a chilling effect to a chilling , powerful movie .
2			stuff	hilarious	album	classic	performances	astounding	edition	special	extras	terrific	edition	new	performances	musical	i	familiar	fan	big	murphy	young			as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years , i really can not believe i have only just got round to watching purple rain . the brand new 2 disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it . wow , i was really looking forward to watching it , but i wasn not prepared for just how electric it actually is . prince's musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding he really has the moves in this one . i am very familiar from repeated listens with the classic purple rain album and all its songs , but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics like computer blue , the beautiful ones , when doves cry and purple rain itself . there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform . the closing songs baby i m a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid -20 he's overflowing ! it blew me away . it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years . prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams drive her to a lake , make her jump in , then drive off absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight . some of the scenes are very 1980 and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film's overall charm . morris day is the coolest cat on the block and hilarious , and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style i love their dancing in this bit , and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid performance . i already can not wait to watch it again , i really can not ! extras are terrific particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a prince groupie .
2			it	worthy	kidman	fabulous	movie	british	air	fresh	buzz	horrible	movie	little	role	glamorous no	role	different	clinker	big			from what critics and audiences indicated , birthday girl had to be a big fat clinker . still , because i love nicole kidman , i decided to rent it last night . it proved to be quite worthy of watching . sure , it isn not your basic american comedy , and it doesn not take a genius to realize that it is a very british movie , but that's why i liked it . it was a change from all the other movies around , a breath of fresh air . sure , there were some plot holes , but overall it worked . first off , kidman was fabulous again in a very different , not very glamorous , but still quite sexy role . she just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in hollywood . not only is her russian accent when she speaks english effective , but there are times when she carries on long conversations in russian and if you didn not know it was nicole kidman , you would never question her authenticity . harrison ford should have taken note in k -19 overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz .
2			backdrop	good	lines	memorable	story	solid	them	hate			terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt , good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines , well acted and well cast , tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
2			setting	new	trite	little	setting	great			a sweet funny story of 2 people crossing paths as they prepare for their weddings . the ex cop writer and the public school teacher fall for each other in this great new york setting , even though they are marrying other people . maybe a little trite in that the partners are both type a personalities , while our protagonists are much more relaxed . not anything heavy , but it made me smile . and hey for the guys sell the natasha henstridge angle , and the gals sell them the sappy romance , everyone wins !
2			culture	different	it	hard	version	original	remake	excellent	acting	enjoyable	musical	good	seemed	appropriate	development	good			i don not like grade inflation but i just had to give this a 10 i can not think of anything i didn not like about it . i saw it last night and woke up today thinking about it . i m sure that the hollywood remake that someone told me about , with j lo and richard gear , will be excellent , but this original japanese version from 1996 was so emotional and thought provoking for me that i am hard pressed to think of any way that it could be improved , or its setting changed to a different culture . a story i found worth watching , and with o fist fight scenes or guns going off or anything of the sort ! imagine that ! all the characters seemed well developed , even non primary characters had good character development and enjoyable acting , and the casting seemed very appropriate . it's always hard to find a good movie musical in our day and age , and perhaps this doesn not quite qualify there is plenty of learning how to dance , but no singing but i really think that gene kelly and others who championed a place for dance in our lives would have thought so very highly of this film and the role of dance in helping to tell a story about a middle aged man , successful with a family in japan , looking for something . he knows not precisely what . to the team of people in japan who contributed to this film , thank you for creating and doing it .
2			movie	good	fighting	great	fan	hard	fan	die	effort	solid	effects	great	film	good			i personally thought the movie was pretty good , very good acting by tadanobu asano of ichi the killer fame . i really can not say much about the story , but there were parts that confused me a little too much , and overall i thought the movie was just too lengthy . other than that however , the movie contained superb acting great fighting and a lot of the locations were beautifully shot , great effects , and a lot of sword play . another solid effort by tadanobu asano in my opinion . well i really can not say anymore about the movie , but if you are only outlook on asian cinema is crouching tiger hidden dragon or house of flying daggers , i would suggest you trying to rent it , but if you are a die hard asian cinema fan i would say this has to be in your collection very good japanese film .
2			novel	best	copy	old	scenery	little	dalton	perfect	she	dead	dalton	handsome	intensity	quiet	face	straight	choice	good			when my now college age daughter was in preschool , this miniseries appeared on a&e from 8 -9 each morning . my neighbor and i made a pact that we wouldn not miss a minute of jane eyre and our kids were late for preschool every morning for the whole week . good choice . i would forgotten how much i loved this movie until i got out my old vhs copy recently . timothy dalton is very handsome , but still perfect as rochester . the dark , craggy face , the imperious demeanor tempered with humor and tenderness were straight from the pages of the book . although dalton eats a little scenery , i couldn not sit through an adaptation starring wimpy william hurt or grumpy ciaran hinds . the magic here is that women love dalton and get caught up in the romance . i would love to know what's become of zelah clarke . she is dead on as jane , quiet , formal , saying volumes with but a look . the sparkle in her eyes gives viewers a glimpse of the strength and spirited nature that helped jane survive the mistreatment she endured in youth . criticism of her performance as wooden is misplaced . a servant in a proper english household would have maintained just such a demeanor , but she speaks passionately when overcome with emotion . unlike many other screen janes , she appears plain enough to be jane yet pretty enough to allow the audience to buy rochester's attraction to her . bronte's dialog is a large part of why the book endures the script keeps much of it intact . dalton and clarke capture the interplay between jane and rochester with wit and quiet intensity . although jane appears as plain and sweet as vanilla custard , she refuses to be cowed by the dark , blustery rochester . the two leads play off each other beautifully . this is the most perfect adaptation of the best romance novel ever .
2			story	simple	gal	gorgeous	stranger	beautiful	morricone	proud	challenge	physical	stranger	mysterious	leone	proud	amount	considerable			the story of a woman from nowhere is rather simple and pretty much adapted right out of a eastwood spaghetti western a mysterious stranger comes into a lawless town run by a kingpin and starts shooting up the place . even the opening credits and music have that spaghetti feel sergio leone and ennio morricone would be proud . the really interesting twists are that the stranger is a beautiful ! woman , saki ryoko yonekura on a harley , and the location is in a town somewhere in japan . in this actioner , there's a considerable amount of gunplay , some of it good , some predictable , and other spots somewhat hokey , but it's a whole lot of fun . ryoko handles her guns with believability and aplomb and gives the thugs their due . it wasn not much of an acting challenge for her as it was a physical challenge , but she handled things very well . she shows her acting skills much more as otsu in the nhk drama , musashi . i would highly recommend film if you are a ryoko yonekura fan which i adoringly am and / or a girls with guns movie fan and it does hold up to repeated viewings . to me , there's something eminently and inexplicably appealing about girls with guns movies like la femme nikita and the long kiss goodnight . and to have a gorgeous gal like ryoko starring in it as well is just gobs of icing on the cake .
2			drama	physical			what a perfect example of less is more . kurt russell sgt . todd only has 72 lines , and something like 104 words . what a challenge ! like a black and white photo , when your mind's eye has to fill in the blanks , the facial expressions , the physical drama , the emotive gesture , all combines to make a stronger impact . this is one of those top 5 movies i can not live without , right up there with the classics like road warrior . if you liked this , check out mad max 2 the road warrior and braveheart both starring mel gibson . also gladiator with russell crowe and connie nielsen who was in soldier also . the thirteenth warrior starring antonio banderas and blade runner starring harrison fo rd
2			comment	useful	it	simple	it	true	view	personal	movie	bad	love	colorful	it	brutal	balkans	creative	colorful	unexpected	movie	great			i don not know why some guys from us , georgia or even from bulgaria have the courage to express feelings about something they don not understand at all . for those who did not watch this movie watch it . don not expect too much or don not put some frameworks just because this is kosturica . watch the movie without prejudice , try to understand the whole humor inside people of serbia did actually getting married while bil clinton bomb their villages , gypsies in all balkans are always try to f ck you up in any way they can , love is always unexpected , pure and colorful , and balkans are extremely creative . for those who claims this is a bad movie i can see only that the american's sh t like meet dave , get smart etc are much much worse than a pure , frank balkan humoristic love story movie as promise me . the comment should be useful and on second place should represent the personal view of the writer . i think the movie is great and people watch it must give their respects to the director and story told inside . it is simple , but true . it is brutal , but gentle and makes you laugh to dead .
2			ones	underrated	home	neurotic	movie	comic	books	comic	viewer	average			in the history of movies based on comic books , mystery men is one of the most underrated ones . this is no regular comic superhero movie ! it follows the exploits of a motley crew of well meaning wannabes , which include mr furious played by ben stiller , the bowler janeane garofalo , the shoveller william macy , the blue rajah hank azariah and the spleen paul reubens . mystery men spoofs several aspects of superhero movies like superman or batman , such as the pithy sayings , and the questions about secret identities . most of the superheroes aren not billionaires like bruce wayne , but blue collar types with menial jobs and neurotic home lives . so it looks as if director kinka usher is making the heroes into something the average viewer can relate to . i found mystery men to be visually stimulating and very funny . even if it doesn not turn into a franchise , it's still a joy to watch !
2			i	surprised	matter	disturbing	gere	good	daines	good			i caught this movie late at night on cable , and i was pleasantly surprised . i can only imagine the reason this movie was not better known , is because the subject matter is very disturbing . but if you can handle the sexual abuse topic , it is a well acted , suspenseful and very interesting movie . both richard gere and claire daines are very good in it . and although the subject matter is not for the faint of heart , the movie doesn not go out of its way to be brutal either like 8 m for instance . i highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys serial killer and suspense type movies .
2			joy	complete	i	scared	writing	sharp	film	good	screen	big	story	humorous	chemistry	best			the matador is hit man movie you can say that about a hit man movie . the violence is never really shown but often introduced . at first i was scared i was in for another retread of mid -90 gangster hit man hipster dark comedy but was happily surprised when i realized this is just a sweet and humorous story about friendship . nothing terribly exciting happens in this film but every bit of it is kept me grinning . the three leads have the best chemistry the big screen has offered in recent years and it looks like they had a great time making this film together . the writing is sharp though at times it felt as if the script had been adapted from a stage play because of the one set dialog scenes . this is a good film that i probably won not remember for too long but at the time it was a complete joy . good film .
2			movies	interesting	it	interesting	actors	awesome	fan	big			i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was . i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed . the two lead actors are awesome , the film isn not ever boring , and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting . there are some weaknesses , such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn not make any sense at all . the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction , but in cinema verite that is a given . but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit .
2			leader	strong	romance	little	strength	true	characters	believable	story	great	cast	fantastic	it	realistic			i haven not seen this film in years so my knowledge is a little rusty . i do remember thinking that this film is twice the film of braveheart . it is simply more realistic and has more believable characters . ridb roy looks like one would imagine rob roy to look like , messy hair and beard with simple clothing . also the liam nesson has a celtic look about him , he looks like a scot and more importantly looks like rob roy . it's a comparison which angers some people but compare him to mel gibson as william wallace . gibson is supposedly playing a man who's legend has caused him to be described as a 6 foot 7 giant while gibson is almost a foot shorter . the story contains a little romance , conspiracy and an underdog story . sound anything like braveheart ? but instead of a film that cries out freedom , liberty and nationalism we get a film which says honour , love and justice . this makes it a more interesting film . much like gladiator . the cast is fantastic and liam nesson is a very strong leader in this endeavour . the story is great with how it deals with heroism and humanity . the scene where mary is raped and she walks out of the burning house with a look of true scottish strength is followed by her washing the semen from her crotch in an extreme panic . this is something a heroine in braveheart would never do . overall this is a stunning and almost flawless watch . go and see it !
2			music	great	ties	strong	stuff	old	clothes	new	me	sad	people	ordinary	movies	good	must	real	girl	young			this is a so called feel good movies , however it made me sad in a way . why ? because i had the talent , but my parents didn not let me study at the sports academy , as well the fact that at the age of 12 i decided to quit soccer . and soccer is the red line in this movie . together with the struggle youngsters have with the expectations parents have . an english indian girl and her parents , with their traditions and strong family ties , and on the other hand the english family with a daugther who dresses like a boy , and plays soccer . a combination which worries her mother ! this movie also lines out the lives of ordinary people , as well as the indian community in england . it is about believe in your dreams , and live your one life where did we hear that before . paraminder nagra a beautiful women ! plays yasminda , a girl who is not interested in boys , new clothes , make up and the typical 17 year old girl stuff . in contradiction with her sister pinky , complete the opposite of yasminda . a real must it is , to see how a young beautiful girl struggles with the traditions of their parents , and finds her luck eventually . with great music from blondie , curtis mayfield , texas , melanie c , as well as indian hit songs . pleasant to watch , but if you , as myself , ever played soccer , and never made it to the top , then this movie will make you melachonic .
2			acting	great	music	great	dialogues	great			a must see film with great dialogues , great music , great acting and a superb atmosphere . in the film you will follow 8 people for one day in the city of antwerp , they are all individuals and sometimes plain weird that's how i love them ! i m not going to say anything else , just go see and enjoy it .
2			vehicle	great	lessons	philosophical	effects	special	boy	young	child	golden	preferences	personal	effects	good	plot	good	mystical	mysterious	movie	entertaining	topic	serious	reality	daily	people	unaware	balance	healthy			this movie is very entertaining , and any critique is based on personal preferences not the films quality . other than the common excessive profanity in some scenes by murphy , the film is a great vehicle for his type of humor . it has some pretty good special effects , and exciting action scenes . as a finder of lost children , murphy's character starts off looking for a missing girl , which leads him on the path for which others believe he was chosen to protect the golden child . the young boy is born as an enlightened one , destined to save the world from evil forces , but whose very life is in danger , if not for the help of murphy , and his beautiful , mysterious and mystical helper / guide / protector . also , there are moments of philosophical lessons to challenge the audience members who are interested in pondering deep thoughts . one such scene is where the golden child , that murphy's character is solicited to protect , is tested by the monks of the mountain temple . an elderly monk presents a tray of ornamental necklaces for the child to choose from , and the child is tested on his choice . this is a fantasy / comedy that is based on the notion that there are both good and evil forces in our world of which most people are completely unaware . as we accept this premise of the plot , we must let go of our touch with a perceived daily reality , and prepare for the earth and walls to crumble away , and reveal a realm of evil just waiting to destroy us . this is an excellent movie , with a good plot , fine acting , and for the most part , pretty decent dialogue combining a serious topic with a healthy balance of martial art fighting , and eddie murphy humor .
2			story	incredible	film	brilliant	kline	convincing	cinematography	breathtaking	cinematography	good	it	worth	it	long	cinematography	superb			this film is , quite simply , brilliant . the cinematography is good , the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking . this is the story of donald woods , a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid . kevin kline is completely convincing so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later , i recognised him from kline's portrayal . denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance , as ever . i urge you to watch this . it is long , but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story . remember , folks , this really happened .
2			one	best	movie	popular	effects	special	it	difficult	effects	enjoyable	movie	enjoyable	it	fascinating			according to the director this movie was popular in asia . it is somewhat difficult to take these mats helge movies seriously since most of his films are shot on a very tight budget . almost no usd at all . but it is fascinating to establish that mats helge eventually completes something which can be called an action movie . the ninja mission is i think the best one among all movies directed by him . some special effects are quite enjoyable . this is not a b or c movie . it is a z movie but an enjoyable and fun z movie !
2			script	thrilling	giallo	classic	journalist	young	martinumber	great	presence	great	genre	illogical	discussion	classic	rd	famous	journalist	attractive	job	good			sergio martino has impressed me recently with his giallo classics not he strange vice of mrs wardh and the unforgettably titled , your vice is a locked room and only i have the key but even so , i wasn not expecting too much from this film . the case of the scorpion's tail doesn not get mentioned as much as the aforementioned titles when it comes to classic giallo discussion but i don not know why , because this is at least as good as those two ! dario argento may be the king of giallo , but with the five films that he made sergio martino surely isn not too far behind . in some ways , he even surpasses the master . all of martino's films were released prior to the jewel in argento's crown , the magnificent profondo rosso , so back in the early seventies martino was the king ! the plot here follows the idea of murder for profit , and follows the insurance payout of a wealthy man . his wife inherits $ 1 million , and it isn not long before there's people out for her blood ! when she turns up dead shortly thereafter , an insurance investigator and a plucky , attractive young journalist follow up the case . the case of the scorpion's tail may not benefit from the beautiful edwige fenech , but it does have two of martino's collaborators on boa rd most famous is george hilton , who worked with marino on the strange vice of mrs wardh and all the colors of the dark , along with a number of other giallos . hilton has a great screen presence , and every time i see him in an italian thriller ; it becomes obvious why he is repeatedly ca st the beautiful anita strindberg , who will be remembered from your vice is a locked room , stars alongside hilton and excellently provides the classic giallo female lead . sergio martino does a good job in the director's chair once again , with several beautiful scenes the best of which taking place in a room bathed with green lighting ! the score by bruno nicolai wardh excellently sets the mood , but it is the script that , once again , is the driving force behind martino's success . ernesto gastaldi , the writer for martino's other four giallo , has put together a script that is thrilling while staying away from the common giallo pitfall of not making sense ; thus liberating this film from the rest of the illogical genre . the case of the scorpion's tail is a quality giallo film , and yet another success for the great sergio martinumber if you like giallo , you will love this !
2			itself	emotional	plot	gripping	plot	mysterious			personally , i think that the film was done very professionally , i loved the choreography and the acting . the plot is also gripping and mysterious . the film itself is very emotional , and what i liked about it most is that it makes you think afterwards . antonio gades has absolutely lived his role to the end , and i must say that it's one of my favourite pictures and saura is a wonderful director .
2			actors	fabulous			fabulous actors , beautiful scenery , stark reality . i won not elaborate on all of the other reviewers comments because you get the picture ! however , the movie isn not for the squeamish . reality is slaughtering pigs and other livestock in order to survive . i also have elinore randall stewart's homestead book . i read it several years ago , i have to reread it , since i just watched the newly released , remastered dvd of the movie . i tried to buy the video for several years , finally bought it used from a video store that went out of business . but yippee ! the dvd is now for sale , i purchased it on not cheap , but well worth it to me . this is a movie i will be watching until the end of my days !
2			characters	best	episodes	best			from the beginning of the show carmen was there . she was one of the best characters . why did they get rid of her ? the show not the same as before . its way worse . the best episodes were with carmen in them . you can not replace someone from the beginning ! that is like south park without kyle or child's play without chucky ! it's not right ! the niece who replaced her is just , ugh ! awful . she doesn not fit into the storyline at all . she was one of the main characters , and the niece can not replace her . she was an awesome actress . way better than the niece . get her back , or you will lose a ton of viewers .

2			story	easy no	rideau	naked			i liked this film very much . the story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow . there is no resolution to the story whatsoever , and you are left to wonder what really happened . since i like that sort of film i enjoyed this . i especially like the dating scenes between the boys and i was drawn into their lives . and of course any film with a naked staphane rideau will get a couple of extra points .

2			neill	good	film	powerful	story	true			this is an extremely powerful based on a true story film that can be infuriating to watch . i say that because how brutal a hounding press can be to people , in this case an innocent australian couple charged with killing their baby . meryl streep received a lot of recognition for her performance when this film came out but i thought sam neill was just as good . let's just say they both were excellent but the role was little harder for streep because she had to learn an australian accent . she learned it so well i had trouble understanding her in parts . without giving anything away , all i can say is this movie will wear you out emotionally .
2			light	different	scene	hilarious	lilly	youngest	life	real	intake	sharp	gulp	little	warmth	little	him	happy	film	good	life	new			how can you sum up just exactly how feelgood and right and touching this film is ? for several weeks this dvd leaped off the shelf at me every time i went in the store having seen steve carrell in a couple of films previously , i didn not want to smear my thought process of him so i resisted and resisted , until finally i grabbed it up with a what the hell ! attitude ! and how surprised was i ! i just wish i had purchased it earlier . having watched it three times in two days i am still smiling at how the portrayal of a widower struggling with three daughters , yearning for that which is missing since the passing of his beloved wife , who thus meets an intriguing woman , charming her in such a profound and interesting dare i say bookish ? way , throws a whole different light onto life that makes him realize she is what he has been searching for . the snag of that woman being his brothers girl complicates matters which portray dan comically shy and with a heartfelt chagrin , seeing his someone special bringing such fun and enjoyment into the family home as well as his brothers life . you just really begin to feel for him . then when the blind date occurs with ruthie draper that is the turning point in marie's estimation of dan ! the look she gives him when he repeats her comment , about not liking ruthie sheer green eyed monster ! triggering an absolutely hilarious scene as the two couples compete on the dance floor ! this sequence is one of the most well crafted as dan starts to loosen up with regard to marie . other gut wrenching scenes dan returns from the book and tackle shop , confronted by his brothers , begins to describe what has just dan's face drops it brings a sharp intake of breath ! his youngest daughter lilly making the present celebrating their love for suzanne , his late wife , brings a little heartfelt warmth and a little gulp as dan realizes just what he has lost in life . when dan plays guitar and sings at the talent voice cracking slightly as he reprises the song . absolute gem ! the acceptance of what occurs late in the film by his all three love their father and want to see him happy , will not let him deny his love for marie ; the desperateness of dan not to fail his daughters because he is their rock , their tell him so much more than that with just a few words . i could go on and on but i will leave it for now maybe return and add more comments here in the near i will end by saying . you want to watch a film that is just so damn good , with twists of comedy to lighten up the drama , that never feels forced or crass , that comes over as a genuine portrayal of a man discovering new life not just with a woman but also with his extended family , then look no further . dan in real life 9 out of 10 for such a well rendered cinematic experience with a score by sondre lerche , that intimately takes you there throughout whilst never being intrusive , with fine performances by the ensemble ca st i cannot wait to re watch this again !
2			transit	soft	cinema	young	mix	usual no			splendid film that in just eight minutes displays an unusual genre mix mystery , thriller , musical . briefly , we are allowed to tell about the story a girl comes into a european cafeteria and then . soft transit from nonsense mystery to narrative logic . in a no time , no place way vigalondo managed a delight in b / w by means of imagination and despite thanks to the tightest of budgets . because of the unity of time space the film reaches the intensity of a short poem almost a haiku . spain , land of quick poetry in b / w remember the early buuel ? a must see for reassuring our belief in young cinema outside the states .
2			love	true	i	lucky	dialog	dead	scene	worth	comedy	romantic	it	predictable	effect	comic	mention	honorable	leads	easy	cry	happy	movie	great			but the fun is in the journey . i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable , not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes , the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times . yes , it's predictable , and yes , it's a clich romantic comedy . but the point is that it's a sweet story , the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways . the dialog is dead on and the acting is well done on all parts , and over the top for comic effect . the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold , the actress there deserves honorable mention ! for those that panned it for being predictable if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing . then you want a thriller . this is a romantic comedy . it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life , and it has been worth every effort along the way . great date movie , great movie for a happy cry .
2			you	close	family	modern	it	popular	dancing	popular	contact	physical			this film revolves as much around japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern japanese family . physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 especially in public hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends / relatives . ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too ! never the less ballroom dancing is on the quite immensely popular . people who do ballroom dancing in japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the we st . many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture . a delightful family film , which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone . i understand that it was more popular than titanic in japan . i guess the japanese are just like the rest of us they like to be hugged too .
2			film	ordinary	detail	great	it	violent	age	watchable	scenes	cute	shots	impressive	voice	nice	beauty	interesting	beauty	true	children	young	waterfalls	big			the spoiler warning is for those people who want to see for themselves what animals and landscapes pass before their eyes , although i don not mention it in great detail . earth is an approx . 90 minute cinema version based on planet earth which i watched all on bbc tv version was narrated by david attenborough , a captivating commentator , who i had wished had also done it for earth but it is patrick stewart , star trek's captain pica rd there are regularly shots of the earth from space so that's may be appropriate . in any case he has a nice enough and calm voice for it . there are 12 chapters in which we follow animal life on earth from north pole to antarctica . 3 animal families , polar bear , elephant and whale , appear in more than one of these parts . each chapter starts with an indication how far from north pole or equator it is . we see something of each kind of animal , but only mammals and birds , and some fish , and some beautiful shots of vegetation , mountains , waterfalls , deserts and jungle , a near perfect presentation of the variety of life and landscapes and climates on earth . you get the impression that our planet is only inhabited by animals people or villages or cities aren not in the film , so it's a typical nature documentary , but breathtakingly shot and accompanied by delightful music . when the film opened i already knew it would end far too soon for me . it is a family film , so no brutal killings of any animals . when one is caught by his hunter the shot ends and in other cases where we see the prey being caught it's shot in slow motion which makes it less violent and watchable for young children age limit 6 in the netherlands . no blood is shed . some scenes newly born animals are really cute and will be adored by kids . it looks like an ordinary nature film but when you know how many shooting days it took 4000 and how much money it has cost it becomes an even more astonishing piece of beauty . it had it's dutch premiere yesterday , a month before the actual release , in a cinema of 500 seats , of which 15 were taken . true beauty is rarely interesting for cinema goers , it see ms as i knew the tv series i was of course very curious if my favourite scenes would make it into this movie . some didn not , but the most impressive shots big waterfalls did , luckily . it was the first time i ever cried in a nature film .
2			craft	special	appreciation	new	effects	special	indie	true	scene	great	scene	little			who wouldn not want to go on road trip with peter falk ? that guy's right eye has more character than most actors today . this is the kind of funny and touching movie we are all looking for as a counterbalance to all the bombastic special effects bores . women are going to love it for all the wake up romance advice for men , and men will love it for its spot on father / son character study one great little scene after another . and it has just enough of an edge to be a true indie find . obviously this is a labor of love for paul reiser who understands what it's like to be both a father and a son , as well as to have both laughter and tears as you move through life . the most fun part , though , was watching reiser watch falk . you could tell it was both his character coming to a new appreciation of his father and a fellow actor really enjoying peter falk's special craft . really delightful . let's hope this film makes it into theaters around the country sometime soon so everyone can have a chance to laugh and cry with paul reiser and folks .
2			star	big	jurors	real	movies	true	movie	solid	movies	best	score	musical	turn	great	creation	frightening			one of the best true crime movies ever made and very faithful to truman capote's book which invented the true crime novel genre . haunting quincy jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry , the killers . why wilson didn not go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me . the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch . the re creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination , even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off . the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders . the movie has a very documentary feel besides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to . nancy clutter's beloved horse , babe , is even in the movie . will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie . this is a solid movie , scary every time you see it .

in some parts , yeah ; it does become a little noticeable , as was also the case in bakshi's american pop , that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky , like some kind of comic book form done in a different way . still , there's much i admired in what was done . the orcs , for example , i found to be really amazing in they are surreal surroundings . they are maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live action , especially during parts where there isn not battle footage that's really the real hit or miss section , as there isn not continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping , and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback . it's creepy in a good way . and the backgrounds , while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy , are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together . it's almost something for art film buffs as much as for the ring nuts . so , how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings ? i don not know , to tell the truth . it's certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i have seen , the hobbit and i have yet to see the animated rotk , and there is some real artistry going on . there's also some stilted dialog , an all too rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all . and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent fil ms if you are a fan of the books contemplating checking this out , i would say it's worth a chance , even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not . as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i have seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement , where as with lynch's dune it's bound to draw a dark , mordor like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don not . i don not .

2			points	different	technique	popular	movies	hate	it	interesting	it	entertaining	nothing	new	noir	good	layers	different	cinematography	good	scenes	different	movie	enjoyable	victor	naive	it	available	films	good			los debutantes is the story of two orphaned brothers who have moved to santiago from the south after their mother dies . the confident and streetwise silvio , the elder brother , gets a job working for a sleazy strip club's owner after taking the naive victor there for his 17 h birthday . as silvio blossoms under his boss's tutelage , both brothers get involved with the owner's sexy and manipulative mistress , gracia . as the film unfolds , characters are redefined as we begin to see the subtle and overt ways that each one manipulates the next . the film is well made , with good cinematography and fast pacing . it's also pretty sexy , with a lot of nudity and some fairly explicit sex scenes . it uses the now popular technique of layering different scenes from different points of view , out of chronological sequence . many people hate movies like this because they don not understand what's going on memento , pulp fiction , reservoir dogs , and many other good films use this device . the plot itself is really nothing new , there are elements of body heat , pulp fiction , and many other good film noir . as the different layers are revealed , our understandings of the characters and their motivations evolve . while the plot may be somewhat clich , it is also clever and entertaining . i would call it an enjoyable movie , worth watching , but nothing memorable . i haven not seen many films from chile , and it's always interesting to see film noir from other countries . other than that , rent it if it's available but don not lose any sleep if it isn not .
2			part	best	movie	good	cast	entire	music	influential	it	interesting	life	real	side	true	events	true	i	young	movie	realistic	genius	musical	reason	due	movie	great			i have recently went back and watched this movie again from not seeing it in years . when i first seen the movie i was too young to understand what the movie was about . now that i have seen it again i couldn not believe what i have missed all these years . for me being able to see movies for what they are , i think that this movie was great . most people feel as though the music are the best part , but i don not think that's true . most people don not realize how good the story is because it's judge by the acting . the truth of the matter is that no one in the movie were really trying to act rather they were just being themselves . the entire main cast were just playing themselves . they weren not trying to be anyone else , but themselves . i have actually watched and analyzed the work and effort put into the movie . now from my perspective , the situations shown in the movie are pretty much based on what actually went on musically in minneapolis at the time and it's most of the things that happen are actually true events that happened in prince's career and who can tell it better than him ? the music that was coming from the city at the time was starting to be recognized and be revolutionary . it was interesting to see how the music was very influential mainly at the club first avenue & 7 h st entry where in fact prince , among other musicians , got their career started . it's also a known fact that prince and morris day always had a competition with each other in real life , but it was a friendly competition . they were always friends . so the story basically plays off of that competition aspect of their rivalry rather than their friendship which shows the true competitive side of what occurred at club first avenue for it's time . another reason why this movie is good is due to the fact that some of the situations that occur in the movie are actually based on events that prince has gone through in his life with the music aspect and the personal . to me , this made the movie more realistic as far as the emotion because he's telling his trials and tribulations pre superstardom . plus , his dedication he puts into his performances is phenomenal . prince made sure that every moment in the movie was done perfectly . anytime you hear a song play in the movie it's in perfect sync with the situation at hand . prince is in all a musical genius and he has proved it on many occasions . this movie is what really put prince on the map officially and he hasn not slowed down since . anyone who has watched this movie or still unbelieveably hasn not watched it yet , when you sit down and view this film you have have to watch it with intellect or you will miss the whole aspect of the movie . if you really love music this is definitely the movie to watch . above what anyone else says i think it's a great movie to watch and own .

2			stories	personal	conversation	personal	movie	timeless			i watched this movie 10 years ago . and have watched it on video an average of once a year since . it's the type of movie that's timeless , because the themes are universal , yet the stories and conversation are so personal . it's also one of the very few movies that capture you from frame one til the credits roll , despite the fact that there are , really , just two very involving characters . this owes a lot to the engaging acting by hawke and delpy , who make us believe that they are actually jesse and celine . this is also the first movie i saw that mentioned reality tv , and now , the phenomenon is rampant ! i love the way this movie just envelops the audience in its space , and makes you think , however jaded you may be , that you are one of those characters . it also made me want to ride the train around europe ! i have not met anyone who has not been able to relate to this movie . maybe that speaks about myself , my friends , or just the sheer genius of this movie .

2			men	young	classmates	former	it	hard	idea	good	flick	underrated	examples	best	editions	special	lockers	old	victims	likable no	reason	good			slaughter high is , perhaps , the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980 . it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout . that being said , it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown . the reason why slaughter high stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over the top . marty , the killer , has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates . they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower , jabbed at his crotch with a javelin , and , to top it off , rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him . so , the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get . when they reunite years later at a high school reunion put on by marty himself you realize they haven not matured all that much . they are a bunch of sociopaths . it is mind boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion , which , by the way , is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair . and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers as well as marty's on display ? there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film . the ending makes little or no sense . and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon . in all , the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre , despite all of its flaws . it is hard to understand why it hasn not yet found its way to dvd , when so many other run of the mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions .
2			niro	great	man	young	she	evil	beauties	classic	man	old	cox	fine	fan	big			while i don not consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies , stardust intrigued me based on seeing michelle pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain especially since i was about to see her as the bossy velma von tussle in hairspray . boy , is she so convincingly evil here as a witch , especially with her age ugly makeup in the beginning and end ! robert de niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide in the closet to protect his reputation ! just about all the actors like claire danes , rupert everett , ricky gervais , peter o not oole and many others do fine work here . while danes and pfeiffer are classic beauties , there's also stunning faces of sienna miller , olivia grant as girl bernard , and kate magowan especially when we first meet her . newcomer charlie cox is fine as the lead tristan and he looked so much like his father dunstan as a young man that i thought that was him in early scenes with magowan actually ben barnes . many comments have compared this to the princess bride and while i can see some resemblances , the main difference was that with pb , you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson . stardust makes you believe , for the most part , that what you are seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout . so on that note , i highly recommended stardu st
2			masterpiece	unexpected	movie	best	it	original	movie	artistic	feel	sorry			i did not expect the performances of gackt and hyde to be as well done as they were , nor did i expect them to be cast in such an artistic well developed movie with enough plot to keep you interested and enough diversity to make it original . this movie was an unexpected masterpiece for me , and i will be on the lookout for the next movie like it . i especially like the fact that it is a vampire movie , but it wasn not a cheesy vampire flick , nor did it over embellish that fact . the characters all had human traits . the way it shows the growth of the characters was incredibly tasteful , and it makes you actually feel sorry for them throughout their lives . i give this movie two thumbs so far up . definitely the best movie i have seen in the past five years .
2			it	funny	mention	special	richardson	miraculous	attention	serious	performances	extraordinary			magic isn not too strong a word for the spell this film weaves . you find yourself relaxing , and seeing others in a more benevolent light . any movie that has that civilizing an effect on viewers deserves serious attention . seldom are we soaked in beauty like this . as if that weren not enough , it's funny . performances are , without exception , extraordinary , but special mention must be made of the miraculous miranda richardson , and the superb josie walker both open like roses . why isn not this film on dvd ? it deserves to live forever .
2			man	old	story	true	commender	new	man	powerful	twists	unexpected	details	rich	humor	sarcastic			based on a true story , this series is a gem within its kind . the slave that becomes queen by capturing the heart of the most powerful man in the village . in the diamond mining town of tijuco in brazil , the diamond commender appointed by the king of portugal is the ultimate authority . having grown up in the relative security of his house , the young and beautiful xica da silva finds her world threatened when he decides to sell her to a whorehouse in town , refusing to recognize that a black slave girl could be his daughter . in a desperate bid to save herself , xica steals the diamonds collected by the diamond commender for the king , intending to use them to escape . the king's army arrives to collect the diamonds the very next day , however , and when the loot turns up missing , the diamond commender is led away in chains , his family dispossessed and thrown out in the street with only the clothes on their backs . martin , the diamond commender's son , swears vengeance . xica and the other slaves , however , are sold at auction , and xica ends up in the home of the sergeant major , an old man who bought her solely to slake his lu st to the town of tijuco , however , comes the new diamond commender , the elegant and ruthless joao fernandes . immediately struck by xica's beauty , he manipulates the sergeant major into selling her to him . and thus begins a love story , filled with danger , intrigue and passion , between a willful nobleman and a crafty slave girl who rises to one day become queen . the series is filled with rich details of the era's beliefs , superstitions , politics , fashion , etc etc and it really manages to captivate your attention for every minute . at times funny with a sarcastic and dark humor , full of suspense and unexpected twists . xica da silva is definitely a mu st i wish i could buy the whole series on dvd .
2			sound	stunning	subject	fascinating	score	stunning	path	important	racecar	new	cinematography	stunning	element	magical	score	musical	drive	best	looks	wonderful			i enjoyed this movie so much that i watched it twice and that is something to say about a documentary . the musical score , cinematography and sound are absolutely stunning as you might expect from an imax production . even though it is shot for those huge imax theaters , it looks and sounds wonderful on my home system . in fact this would make a perfect dvd to demo your system . the subject is also so fascinating . it is about mario andretti and his son michael . i was already a fan of mario because he is the best racecar drive in history since he is the only person to win the cart championship , f 1 championship , the daytona 500 and the indianapolis 500 the script follows the path of two cars very important to the father and son . the first car is found in a chicken coop and turns out to be the first roadster that mario ever drove and we follow restoration to gleaming perfection . the other car is michael's new racecar and we follow it from cutting the mold through the race season . imax lends just the right magic to make car construction entertaining and fascinating . paul newman , who was michael amoretti's team owner at the time this movie was made , narrates the film . his anecdotes and witticism , drawn from many years as an owner and driver , lends much to the production . the main feature is the race scenes . turn up the volume here ! there is something about riding along at over 200 mph and the musical score that totally draws you into the screen for an experience you will not forget . wow ! the final magical element is the humanity of the andretti family . this god of the racing world , mario andretti , is loving father who proudly watches over his son's career . they work together so well that every father and son should see this . you can tell that they are a close family . i wish we could all have that experience .
2			interpretation	superb	mcdermott	terrific	story	horrible	kilmer	terrific	seventies	amazing			val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific . i have seen kilmer on the doors , however his interpretation of john holmes is superb . nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow . wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around . at the same time , the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed . the movie deserves being watched more than once . the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing .

2			debut	directorial	movie	little	i	impressed	film	little	conflict	real	meaning	psychological			who would have thought that such an obscure little film could be so haunting and touching ? i am really impressed . it's a shame that more people have not seen it . i loved , as always , hans zimmer's score . and what a directorial debut by bernard rose ! yet i wonder if i should call this a horror film . it could easily be argued that it is a fantasy or a drama as well . well , regardless , i love the interpretive potential it has . everything and everyone in anna's played by charlotte burke dreams represents a real conflict in her house itself , the tree , mark , the lighthouse , etc it is the many details such as these that make the film so good for repeated viewings . i hope i come across another little movie as loaded with emotion and psychological meaning as this one some time soon .
2			words	awesome	pitfalls	creative	dvd	amazing	station	local	story	intriguing	i	incapable			i had the privilege of seeing this film at a preview screening years ago , and outside the theater i was confronted by a camera crew from a local tv station looking for comments on the film . at the time , the only words that escaped my mouth were awesome . just awesome . i like to think i can articulate myself a little better than that , but at the time i was somewhat incapable of doing so . the story is intriguing and thought provoking , and the acting is first rate from all the principals . this film was the first one that terry gilliam directed that he didn not have a hand in the writing credit for . back with universal after his long , arduous battle with them over brazil , terry had achieved what he wanted most ; the final cut . terry is a master craftsman , and each shot is like a beautifully conceived painting that has been constructed carefully with determination and conviction . it is only justice that such an individual should be unfettered in his attempts to convey a concept . unfortunately , limitations still exist in such arrangements . the universal collector's edition dvd of this film is simply amazing , although most of the bonus features aren not listed on the box . it contains among other things , a director / producer audio commentary and an informative and extremely interesting 90 minute documentary on the making of the film called the hamster factor and other tales of 12 monkeys . it tells of some of the creative pitfalls in filmmaking , including a test of mettle when preview screenings tested poorly , striking the team with feelings of self doubt and despair . fortunately , for all of us , they decided to change very little about the film and released it to an enormous success .
2			delilah	biblical	symbolism	visual	film	atmospheric	symbol	important	it	easy	fantasies	realistic	states	united	sequence	erotic	man	funny	author	troubled	gera	famous			paul verhoeven has one of the strangest oeuvres of any major director he started off making art house films in his native netherlands before moving to hollywood where he began making subversive genre pieces which are often seen as mere entertainments by the mainstream crowd . 1983 s the fourth man was the last film he made before moving to the the united states and it seems to have been a transitional film for him . from the beginning of the fourth man it's clear that the film will be seen from the perspective of the famous albeit impoverished author gera rd in a seeming homage to carol reed's similarly titled 1949 film the third man the film begins with an author making a trip to speak to a crowd of literature enthusiasts . the similarities end there , however , as gerard runs into no major complications before arriving at the auditorium and the speech itself goes fairly smoothly . in spite of the relative ease with which he completes this function we know that the author is somewhat troubled as he has realistic fantasies about murdering his roommate before leaving his house and he also has a surreal fantasy involving a hotel he sees advertised and a detached eyeball growing out of a door's peephole . that he sometimes has trouble keeping his fantasies separate from reality is made all the more clear when an anecdote he tells is exposed as untrue and he admits that he lie{s} the truth until {he} no longer knows whether something did or didn not happen . the fourth man is full of surreal fantasies and dreams which are made all the more disturbing because it's very easy to see how they relate to events which we have seen occur and because they sometimes foreshadow events which haven not occurred yet . between the effectiveness of the unreal sequences and verhoeven's careful editing style this ends up being the most atmospheric film this side of don not look now and like that film this one is full of ambiguity . unlike that film the fourth man is also perversely funny as gerard's deeply held catholic beliefs seep into every aspect of his life including sexuality . he naturally associates a female hair stylist he knows intimately with the biblical delilah though he fears she will remove an even more important symbol of masculinity with her scissors . in an erotic fantasy sequence that would make luis buuel blush he substitutes a man he's attracted to for a life size statue of christ on the cross . the fourth man is a horror film which manages to bring the viewer into the mind of the protagonist while still maintaining a certain ambiguity it certainly seems as if gerard is in danger but it may just be more of his lying the truth . the film is also full of both subtle and not so subtle visual symbolism which helps make it a unique and satisfying cinematic experience .
2			look	worth	fun	great	brides	young	budget	low	hag	old			bela lugosi appeared in several of these low budget chillers for monogram studios in the 1940 s and the corpse vanishes is one of the better ones . bela plays a mad scientist who kidnaps young brides and kills them and then extracts fluid from their bodies so he can keep his ageing wife looking young . after a reporter and a doctor stay the night at his home and discover he is responsible for the brides deaths , the following morning they report these murders to the police and the mad scientist is shot and drops dead shortly afterwards . you have got almost everything in this movie the scientist's assistants consist of an old hag , a hunchback and dwarf her sons , a thunderstorm and spooky passages in bela's house . bela and his wife find they sleep better in coffins rather than beds in the movie . the corpse vanishes is worth a look , especially for bela lugosi fans . great fun . rating 3 stars out of 5

2			series	interesting	things	new	levels	nice	addition	refreshing	world	new	levels	good	interesting	different	addition	great	skateboard	nice	games	great	levels	long	skater	understandable			tony hawk underground came at a point where the series was really starting to lose its luster , tony hawk pro skater 4 did not live up to expectations and left the series really up in the air on what neversoft and activision could do with the series that would be different and interesting . underground introduced the storymode , which was very cool because it made a whole new world for tony hawk pro skater fans . another feature introduced which fans pretty much argued for and that was being able to get off the skateboard , which is nice because now you can actually climb , run , and do all sorts of new things . the levels are good , neversoft also improved on an issue that started with pro skater 3 and that was the length of the level designs . the first two games for the ps 1 n 64 and dreamcast were great because the levels were nice and long and some hidden features in some . pro skater 3 and 4 were shortened because of a handful of features that were added and really pushed the systems too their limits . in this version , they shortened those features , there isn not as many people wondering the streets , in fact there are almost none in some levels , and the graphics and the skating physics are toned down a little but not a lot . this game does have one con , the storymode is a little short , of course this is neversofts first time doing this with tony hawk pro skater , so that is understandable . however , with that being said you will definitely finish this game within a day . overall , a great addition that was very refreshing .
2			deal	great	organization	big	conformity	obsessive	satire	little	budget	low	spin	modern	values	nuclear	friend	best	conformity	social	violence	graphic	members	useful			who says zombies can not be converted into useful members of the community ? certainly not the makers of fido , who take us to a never never land version of the 1950 s where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class . timmy robinson is the all american boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full time domestic a recently resurrected zombie whom timmy has affectionately dubbed fido . all of this has been made possible by zomcom , a big brother type organization that has found a way to render the zombies who were originally brought to life by radiation from outer space manageable and docile at least most of the time . this twisted , modern day spin on the tv series lassie it might easily have been entitled a boy and his zombie takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre 60 concerns as obsessive social conformity here keeping up with the joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door , the sterility of suburban life , the corporate control of civic affairs , small town corruption and nuclear family values all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns . the movie doesn not hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs . instead , this is a low keyed , subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full bellied guffaws . much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community life magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled death magazine . despite some playfully graphic violence , the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950 s itself and the cheesy , low budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade . k'sun ray , carrie ann moss and dylan baker are amiable and appealing as the wide eyed timmy and his cleaver esquire parents with slightly sinister undertones , while billy connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse . this is what lassie might have been had timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies .
2			concept	amazing	i	aware	i	political	shot	perfect			i have watched this documentary twice and although i m an major movie buff , most documentaries don not hold my attention . this film however was mesmerizing . almost every shot is perfect saying so much more than an audio commentary which this documentary does not have . the concept of this film is amazing , i can not praise it enough . mardi gras beads who would have thought ? amazing and excellent choices of interviews film footage of a factory in china the film makes you feel like you are actually there . i m political aware and i have read several books on globalization so there wasn not anything in this film that was a surprise to me . however , it's made me think so much . i wish so much too , that this world was a better place . a million kudos to the filmmaker and thanks for making this film too . i wish everyone could see it .

2			film	great	look	incredible	web	brilliant	release	international	truth	easy no	film	best	sense	little	spinster	fantastic			i saw this film at the adelaide film festival 07 and was thoroughly intrigued for all 106 minutes . i like documentaries , but often find them dragging with about 25 minutes to go . forbidden lie$ powered on though , never losing my intere st the film's subject is norma khoury , a jordanian woman who found fame and fortune in 2001 with the publication of her book forbidden love , a biographical story of sorts concerning a muslim friend of hers who was murdered by her family for having a relationship with a christian man . a few years later though , a few journalists started poking holes in the story , leading the public to believe it was fraud . the film covers this quickly but thoroughly in the beginning , and from there we spend most of our time in the company of norma as she tries to convince us that her novel is more than fiction . director anna broinowski has found a truly fascinating woman to study , and she conducts endless interviews with khoury as she seeks the truth . as always in life , the truth is not so easy to find . norma fears for her life , worried about violent backlash over the unsavoury portrait her novel paints of jordanian musli ms she refuses to return to jordan and show us the facts . broinowski is not deterred however , and slowly puts the pieces together in front of us . the result is an incredible look inside the mind of a con arti st naturally , what we find there makes little sense and is extremely difficult to follow , and ultimately we don not know whether to believe norma or not . she's either a rather unfairly put upon woman trying to survive , or a fantastic spinster . the web of lies , truths and half truths she turns through the film is brilliant . the film uses much interview footage , as well as dramatisations to tell it's story , and broinowski uses these dramatisations to show us why people like norma are able to exist we want to be conned . we go to the cinema every day and allow ourselves to believe what's happening on the screen is real . that might just be me reading into things a bit too much , it didn not come up in the q&a with brionowski after the film , but that's what i took away from it . this is a great australian film , and must receive an international release , and a swag of awards if you ask me . certainly the best film i saw at aff 07 go see it , if you get the chance .
2			film	inspirational	story	stereotypical	effects	special	it	interesting	it	cute	i	impressed			to my surprise i quite enjoyed 'spacecamp , i remember seeing it about 13 years ago , and recently i hired it again . i was quite impressed . obviously the special effects in todays space films such as armageddon and deep impact are far superior to those in spacecamp . however , this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it . but thats what i liked about it they don not make films like this anymore , so it was a refreshing change . it was interesting to see kelly preston , leaf phoenix and lea thomson in early roles , with tom skerrit and kate capshaw to add substance to the light & fluffy plot . absolutely loved the robot named jinx , it was very cute , but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters . the film was almost inspirational in its own way , and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the nasa spacecamp in alabama i think .
2			cast	entire	plots	good	show	great	job	great	cast	wonderful			i love this show , it's sure to be a winner . jessica alba does a great job , it's about time we have a kick ass girl who's not the cutesy type . the entire cast is wonderful and all the episopes have good plots . everything is layed out well , and thought over . to put it together must have taken a while , because it wasn not someone in a hurry that just slapped something together . it's a great show altogether .
2			film	perfect	you	sorry no			i thought this film was just about perfect . the descriptions / summaries you will read about this movie don not do it justice . the plot just does not sound very interesting , but it is . just rent it and you will not be sorry !
2			status	social	abomination	true	you	quiet	machine	big	household	liberal	art	visual			if you were born around the time this movie was finished , and had a liberal / open minded household that i had , i m sure during the early 80 s you would be first introduced to walking in on your parents watching dirty movies or extreme dirty movies . you know , not 100 pornographic but rather an alchemical mixture of actual drama and pornography , or that you would sneak into their collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of such a film in a big dookie machine called a vhs . you had to be very quiet and ninja like but still having minor heart failure when huge pop noises were made when pressing the tablet like buttons out of fear of being discovered . whatever the case , such films were sent into the back of your mind , waiting and waiting to be reunited with such visual art . needless to say , this movie fits into the aforementioned description to a t . many people will comment on the extreme sexual nature of the film but perhaps due to me being desensitized , i am more disturbed by the subtleties . was the creator speaking to us on deeper levels of human carnality and or what could be considered a true abomination , interracial relations , bed frame masturbation , voyeurism , or could it be desperation for social status to the point of murder , pedophilia / homosexuality , or the repressed sexual nature of social elitist females in 18 h century france ? who can say , but despite mr borowcyzk's taste for vivid , raw sexuality being the norm for his works , i would say that indeed this movie does speak to the viewer on a deeper level concerning bestial carnality . once i have learned this , the story became much more interesting beyond the giddiness of shock value and there fore , it is well worth checking out .
2			depiction	great	events	real	spots	impressive	performance	best	lindy	complex	she	dead	coverage	sensational	camp	entire	country	entire			lindy meryl streep and her husband michael sam neill have just welcomed a baby girl , azaria . as seventh day adventists , they live their beliefs every day and soon have azaria dedicated to god at their church , with their two older boys looking on . michael gets a vacation and the family decides to head to ayer's rock , one of the most impressive tourist spots in all of australia . not being wealthy , the family camps near the site . after a wonderful first day , lindy puts baby azaria to sleep in one of the tents . suddenly , she hears azaria crying . as lindy rushes to the tent , a dingo dog is just exiting , shaking his head . the baby is gone and soon , so is the dingo . although the entire camp looks for the baby , she is not found . concluding she is dead and that the dingo made off with their beloved child , the chamberlains struggle to accept god's decision and go on with their lives . but , unfortunately , the story gets sensational coverage in the news media and soon the tale is circulated that lindy murdered the baby . she is subsequently arrested and put on trial . how could this happen ? this is a great depiction of real events that shows how mob rule is not a figment of the imagination . the entire country turns against the chamberlains , in part because they are seen as odd . streep gives her best performance ever as the complex lindy , whose own strong willed demeanor works against her every step of the way . neill , likewise , does a wonderful job as the hesitant and confused michael . the cast is one of the largest ever , with depictions of folks around the country getting their digs into lindy's case . the costumes , scenery , script , direction and production are all top of the line . if you have never seen or heard of this film , remedy that straight away . it is not a far cry from reality to say that this cry should be seen by all who care about film and about the misused power of the media .
2			boys	funny	it	interesting	story	different	voight	hilarious			i found about the movie holes by hearing from people that it wasn not typical disney , that both kids and adults both got into the story . folks , let me tell you i wasn not disappointed . holes is based on the novel by louis sachar and follows the adventure of stanley yelnats , a boy who gets sent to a strange juvenile detention camp out in the desert . he befriends a boy nicknamed zero and together they set out on adventure that changes their lives . it was a very interesting , unique , different and funny story . i didn not know quite what to expect when i watched it . it was interesting to see the story come together like pieces of a puzzle . the boys who played the juvenile delinquents were all very funny and jon voight was just hilarious as mr sir . now that i have seen the movie , i have to read the book . most recommended !
2			broadcast	old	dilemmas	scary	it	nice	tom	great	short	good	cartoon	classic	tom	best	tom	classic	it	understandable	short	single	cartoon	hate	broadcast	scary			spoilers tom and jerry is a classic cartoon , with a flawless idea , and almost every single short is a gem . while i must say that this is definitely an inferior short compared such other classic tom and jerry shorts , there is not way you can hate this cartoon . sure , it is understandable to say that this is one of the worst of the first tom and jerry episodes , and i can say that i agree , but the fact of the matter is that all tom and jerry episodes are great , but some are just better than others . well , this would fit into others . here is the plot of fraidy cat . tom is listening to an old scary radio broadcast , and becomes easily frightened . jerry observes how scared he is , and tries to scare him even more than he already is . he creates scary dilemmas for tom , and tom becomes scared out of his wits , and his lives . jerry then puts a sheet over a vacuum cleaner and controls it , thus making it look like the vacuum is a gho st tom finds out that jerry did all of this , and chases him . tom then accidentally bites the house maid . however , at the end jerry ends up the one becoming scared after he sees his reflection in a flour cup . overall , this is far from the best tom and jerry short out there , but this is still a fun and entertaining piece of time . it makes me wish that there was more cartoons like this . the slapstick and gags in this that make tom and jerry famous are as good as ever in this short , but it felt like something was missing in this . it felt slower than most tom and jerry shorts . anyway , this is a good short that does not quite live up to some other tom and jerry cartoons , but it is still nice . 7 10

2			i	young	everything	brilliant	filmmakers	contemporary			watching midnight cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting / directing / cinematography / editing / writing . i was too young to watch it when it was originally released , and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago , but it has absolutely stood the test of time , and i have watched it several times since . everything about this film is brilliant , from the poignant performances from voight and hoffman even though i know this movie well , i still find myself welling up every time voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks , or hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences . it's a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren not prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one . midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools . 10 10

2			it	necessary	procedures	important	license	artistic	flaws	worthy			i can only echo the praise of the other reviews here . it's a delightful film with a feelgood factor that it achieves without crossing the line into soppy sentimentality . naturally sweet no added sugar . one small point it seems to me that the mild objections raised about ustinov's character pendelton being able to walk in and defeat the system security ignore the fact that pendelton is clearly a genius / savant at this sort of thing . yes , the film was pretty computer illiterate , but it did show pendelton 'studying computers at his flat , and i believe the implication was supposed to be that his gifts allowed him to simply engulf the whole subject , practically overnight . there were a few odd moments when it appeared in some scenes that gnatpole was trying to test pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff . i m not sure whether we were supposed to believe that pendelton cunningly weaselled his way out of these situations , or whether he was actually knowledgeable enough to pass the tests it was a little unclear . certainly he had to know enough to set up the dummy accounts . presumably wallach and ustinov were relying on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked in those days , and in order to understand in detail what they were getting at , it's necessary to know quite what their concept was . they knew there was something about procedures which was important ; they thought that the 'smart light could actually control security , rather than just indicate its state ; they thought that the dumb user terminal's features would strongly influence what could be done on the mainframe itself though apart from things like graphics feature i don not see it meself . mostly , i think they tried to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as far as they could , and they did that rather well . allowing them a bit of artistic license , i don not think their efforts had any flaws worthy of note . cd
2			thriller	good	setting	low	themes	similar	film	worthwhile			house of games is definitely not without its flaws plot holes , stiff acting , final scenes but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head . house of games does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do . of course , this is not a huge feat given the fact that we are dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate . so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on , even though we think that we do . but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game ; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities . it has a definite hitchcock slant to it . the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort marnie , considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master's more thought provoking works . one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse's character being the same as tippi hedrin year later perhaps . both are strong willed loners , both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool . as crouse's repressed , up tight character says , what's life without adventure ? put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks !
2			ray	unforgettable	squatter	poor	setting	perfect	anyone	gorgeous	anyone	expressive			i had never seen a silent movie until july 24 2005 i had never seen a movie with mary pickford in it . i have seen thousands of movies . very few are hypnotic to me . i found last of the mohicans and unforgettable ray liotta to be hypnotic , so consider the source as you read this . i started watching tess of the storm country on tcm just to see who this mary pickford was , who has been credited by many for launching hollywood . i had no idea what i was in for . two hours later , i snapped out of it , and realized i would watched one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen , playing a role perfectly suited to her . imagine a movie fan in 1922 having never seen anyone that gorgeous and that expressive before . you would have to see her again and again . the setting was perfect for a girl that expressive . she was a poor squatter , couldn not speak the king's english , but you had to admire her . what a movie . time to start my mary pickford movie collection !
2			i	lucky	movie	awesome	plot	unique	gackt	young	movie	amazing	i	surprised	ending	happy			this movie is amazing . the plot was i was very surprised by gackt's and hyde's performance , after growing up in the american world of the actors who can not sing and singers who can not act . in this movie , a young sho gackt comes across a vampire , kei hyde . over time , they form an unlikely friendship . kei is suffering because of how he is forced to live off others , the half life of a vampire . it's a sad movie , but not sappy . the plot was very unique , and contrary to your typical vampire flick . the storyline was thick with twists and turns and very entrancing . the only fault i would say the movie had , despite it's lack of a happy albeit peacefulending , would be it's multiple languages . i had the unsubdued version i m lucky that i understood it all save some of the cantonese , so i would recommend getting something with subtitles . all in all , the movie was just awesome .
2			comedies	best	family	complete	issues	social	it	serious	depiction	realistic	i	surprised			this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment . it takes the sugary sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats , brat brothers , over protective fathers and bimbo sisters . i m almost surprised it's disney ! to its credit , 8 simple rules knows it's a comedy and doesn not try to be more . too many shows eg , 'sister , sister and lizzie mcguire think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard hitting . this is a trap 8 simple rules has avoided ; it does tackle some issues such as being the school outcast but it has fun while doing so . in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character . and i think , although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark , 8 simple rules can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn not make cate's father a second version of paul hennessy .
2			dedication	rare	directing	great	fact	subtle	performance	best	purpose	rare	use	good	it	great	love	intense	feeling	nice	music	great			i thought this was a wonderful movie . it touches every fiber of a human being . the love in the film is very intense . i thought it was will's best performance to date . great directing . liked the editing . music was great . good use of flashback . this is the kind of movie everyone should go see . i hope people will get something wonderful from this . overall , excellent movie . i think hollywood should make more movies with substance . even action films can have a caring story . i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting . he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see . i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about . for me , i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film . the outside world was suspended for a moment . it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world . and with this me generation it was great to see something someone that cared about other people more than himself .
2			film	powerful	it	spectacular	it	excellent	figure	solid	lange	strong	experience	emotional	he	nasty	vs	good			this is one powerful film . the first time i saw it , the scottish accents made it tough for me to understand a lot and that ruined the viewing experience . i gave up on it but then acquired the dvd , used the english subtitles when i needed them , and really got into this movie , discovering just how good it is . it is excellent . the widescreen picture makes it spectacular in parts , with some wonderful rugged scenery and the story reminded me of braveheart , an involving tale of good versus evil . here , it's liam neeson good vs . tim roth evil . both do their jobs well . few actors come across as despicable as roth . man , you really want to smack this guy in his arrogant , irritating puss . he is so nasty and vile the sick critics love his character more than anyone else's here . neeson is a man's man and a solid hero figure as gibson was in braveheart . jessica lange is strong in here as the female lead . the movie draws you in and gets you totally involved , so prepared to have an emotional experience viewing this .
2			i	surprised	it	inspiring	it	available			oh , the sixties . there were some interesting fil ms i was more of a movie goer then . i now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater . i also saw this short film , the legend of the boy and the eagle . i have been searching for this film for years . it was truly inspiring . surprisingly , i was finally able to gather more information from your site . thank you . . i m surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a disney picture . i too did not remember the disney film . i did not even remember that it was an opening film for disney . i truly wish they would show this on tv sometime . i wonder if disey holds the rights to this film ? is it available on dvd ? this is a must see for all generations ! !
2			actress	good			i like the movie . twisted desire had jeremy jordan , one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever . melissa joan hart is a good actress . i have seen most of her movies but all of jeremy jordan's . the thing i dislike about twisted desire is when nick gets arrested and jennifer rats him out . twisted desire is my second favorite movie . my first is the goonies . but i still love jeremy jordan .
2			jj	comical			another norman lear hit detailing the problems that african americans had to go through in the turbulent 1960 and 1970 . with esther rolle and husband along with 3 children living in a chicago high rise project in a predominantly black neighborhood , the show depicted what black people were going through with a landlord black agent mr bookman as well as prices and the day to day problems of just existing . the 3 children depicted how people seem to face their problems differently from the comical jj to the militant ralph carter , to their daughter who also aspired to attain success , this show was a perfect description of african american life .
2			lesson	good	seem	real	talking	old			this show has a few clichs and a few over the top , dawson's creek like moments a 16 year old talking about way back when life made sense ? but overall it seems like a decent show . most of the characters seem very real , and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot ending with a good lesson in the end . i just hope every episode doesn not turn out to be life altering like the first , that would just be too much drama for this vehicle . jeremy sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball , i believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of .
2			they	proud no	performance	natural	i	surprised			the performance of every actor and actress in the film are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be ; and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again . however , i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors and director , attenborough's credits that puzzles me aren not they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent , long lasting film for the audience ? i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one possibly one of the knowledgeable personnel insider of the film .
2			film	great	pace	bad no	pace	fine			this isn not exactly a great film , but i admire the writers and director for trying something a little different . the film's main theme is fate and small , seemingly insignificant things that can greatly change the future . in some ways this reminds me of the film sliding doors , though instead of focusing on one random event , seemingly random stuff happens repeatedly and each one helps build to the cute conclusion . plus , an odd bald guy seems to understand all this and he talks about this during one brief scene like he's some sort of omnipotent being but there's absolutely no explanation of him in the film like the two guys that fight each other in the clock tower in the hudsucker proxy . the dvd jacket shows just audrey tautou . this is capitalize on her success in amelie , though she is only one of many actors in the film and there is no one starring role . the pace is brisk , the acting fine and the conclusion isn not bad at all . the only reason i didn not score it higher is that some of the characters were a bit uninteresting and i think the movie could have perhaps been tightened up with a few less subplots .
2			it	difficult	film	cheesy	feeling	ill	it	entertaining	it	worth	newswomen	young	it	scary	film	creepy			this is a long lost horror gem starring sydney lassick carrie and others and barbara bach . it is sometimes difficult to locate a copy of this film but it's worth it . this film is creepy yet cheesy at the same time . it seems that 3 young newswomen karen , vicky , and jennifer travel to the small city of solvang , california to cover a festival when a mix up occurs involving their hotel room and they seek refuge at the home of earnest keller lassick and his strange wife virginia . vickie stays behind , feeling ill , as the other 2 are off to film their story . she is soon murdered at the house , in a very cheesy way by some unknown force hiding in the ventilation system she is decapitated by the closing cover of the vent as it comes crashing down on her while she is being tugged through and into the basement . soon karen returns and she is murdered in an even more brutal fashion by having her face rammed through the vent cover . jennifer is fighting with her ex ? lover in a rather boring sub plot and when she returns home , her hosts whom by now we have discovered are brother and sister and that whatever it is that is in the basement is their son devise a plot to try to murder her as well . virgina does not totally agree with earnest's plan to murder jennifer but she is tricked into going into the basement where she meets junior . here the film turns almost comic as junior portrayed hysterically by stephen furst is a deformed , mentally deficient , manchild whose actions and motions will cause a few chuckles even though it's supposed to be scary . this is where the pace of the film picks up and the ending is well done . the actors / actresses do a terrific job with the material especially lassick , furst , and bach and although it's not the most horrifying film ever made it is highly entertaining !
2			comments	unbelievable	negative	single	style	different	comments	positive no			this was an absolutely spellbinding series and was sorry that i was only able to catch a few shows way back when it aired late night in the uk . the style of it was so different from others of its kind and the whole thing had an unnerving air of stylish dread to it . all you have to do is read all the positive comments not a single negative that i can see to realise what a really innovative series this was and how it caught at the imagination . i now understand from reading the comments it got cancelled that's just so unbelievable . what a bunch of headless overpaid suited turkeys there must have been or just maybe still are running around to do that .
2			environment	social	impact	big	town	entire	clique	popular	chemistry	real	job	great	film	entire			i first saw this when it premiered more than ten years ago . i saw it again today and it still had a big impact on me . she fought alone is about a girl , caitlin played by tiffani thiessen , who is raped by jace played by david lipper , a classmate who enjoys hurting girls . caitlin is in a popular high school clique , but when she reveals she is raped the clique turns against her , led by ethan played by brian austin green . this movie chronicles caitlin's struggle against an entire town , including a high school that essentially lets athletes determine the social environment , allowing them to get away with whatever they wish . thiessen and green are the top performers , and there is real chemistry between the two of the them throughout the entire film . all of the actors in this film , which was inspired by actual events , did a great job . she fought alone really captures the essence of what it is like to be in high school at least in 1995 , and having one's self esteem and reputation at stake . recommended . 10 10
2			love	true	it	interesting	woman	young	echo	direct	father	honest	father	believable	cast	new	currents	strong			anna christie 1931 on its own terms , this version of garbo's anna christie , shot a year later in german with a whole new cast , is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the english version both are american mgm productions . garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained . and she seems frankly more at ease , probably for a lot of reasons , but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture , so had adjusted quickly . without comparing always one film to the other , this anna christie is still the same o neill play with too many words . his themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here , but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway . there are some scenes missing the coney island section is shortened and isn not as good but overall it's a direct echo of the first film . the director , jacques feyder belgian french , is simply redoing what was done already , which i assume must be a frustrating experience . it's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way not only the sets , but the shots , are all the same . there is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film some of the storm , understandably , but also a brief scene where marie dressler from the english language version is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal , drunk as can be . but they are just silhouettes , and when the next scene shows their faces , we see the german actors taking their parts . there is no replacing dressler , for sure , but for me the german father is more believable and honest in his performance . clearly the themes immigration , wayward fathers , daughters turning to prostitution , and the troubles of finding true love have strong currents back then , especially with european threads garbo , appropriately , plays a swedish young woman .
2			play	great	julie	big	comedy	good	mention	special	respect	due	version	great	players	terrific	kaye	great	pulley	excellent			in 1954 marlon brando was the hot actor after his performances in streetcar named desire and on the waterfront . frank sinatra had yet to re invent himself on the silver screen . but sinatra's portrayal as the erstwhile nathan detroit , helped re establish sinatra with his fans . it is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific . imagine a movie where brando sings ? this was his one and only singing role as he portrayed sky masterson . in addition the female leads , jean simmons and vivian blaine replaying her stage role as nathan's long suffering girlfriend adelade , put in superlative efforts . special mention goes to the great stubby kaye as nicely nicely , and with all due respect to eric clapton , no one's version of rockin the boat even comes close to stubby's . sheldon leonard , who would go on to fame as tv producer of such shows as the danny thomas show and the dick van dyke show does harry the horse wonders , b . s . pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking big julie , and even regis toomey offers his excellence as brother arvide . it is one of the fun musicals to see , good comedy , and you get sinatra and brando . soooooo luck be a lady tonight and brother . it's your dice
2			movie	good	ending	true			the villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing , that is what i guess makes him so mean . i don not think most men will like this movie , especially if they ever cheated on their wife . this is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end . but then , there you have it , a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say , hokie as hell . a pretty good movie until the end . ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning . and then there is the aftermath of what happened . guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending . i m left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end .
2			i	glad	goth	social	drama	good			my children just happened to stop at this movie the other night and as things started to play out it really piqued my intere st i had to head out for bowling league so i had them record it for me on the dvr so i could watch the rest later . well i just got done watching it and the front of my shirt must be soaked after crying buckets . it was an excellent movie even though i could almost feel the pain and anguish these girls were experiencing . and i never in a million years would have guessed the reason why alissia had gone from this beautiful girl to an anti social goth . this was probably why my shirt was soaked because i have experienced that same pain that alissia was feeling . i too would not have sought out this movie , but i m sure glad i saw it . very moving , very touching . great for those who love a good drama or tear jerker .
2			dramas	classic	it	hard	it	difficult	villain	nasty	drama	modern	story	good	admirer	strong	he	ill	audience	modern	shame	great	embrace	good	watch	good			spoilers . . i saw the original on tv sometime ago and remembered this production as less gripping than most beeb costume drama . i rewatched on dvd this week and still have the same impression of it . it's a good story at first , but weakens when the heroine becomes oh so terribly brave and noble and returns to her utterly vile husband when he's ill and i got so totally irritated with her saintliness . i suppose this was the right thing to do when the story was written as well as contributing plenty of angst , and it was difficult for a woman to be independent of her husband as marriage made her no more than his possession , let alone to carry on scandalously with a lover as i expect a lot of the modern audience would have liked to see . but it's hard to take the santimoniousness nowadays and especially when this heroine had a strong , brave admirer ready to defend her against anyone and everyone . so re the story as in the film i m equivocal . it's well done as per the novel , but somewhat irritating as per today's kind of life . steadfast hero gilbert was certainly a saint to put up with his ladylove's variable and often cryptic behaviour and persistent self denial and to be so consistently supportive . so i felt it a great shame that when helen was at long last free to be with him , the script didn not allow him a bit more than about one minute to fall on each other for a quick hug before the titles came up . this was completely ridiculous when we would been waiting all this time through all that dripping sentiment over the undeserving husband for a decent bit of dialogue and a good embrace between hero and heroine . instead , the ending was as though the film makers had run out of time or finance or just couldn not be bothered . here you are one minute , do what you can in that , then cut as the director wants to go home now . . i was left feeling totally dissasatisfied . however , very high commendations to the acting of toby stephens a perfect and very handsome hero , and rupert graves a superbly nasty and self pitying villain . tara fitzgerald was satisfactory within the confines of the script that forced her to be a depressing and rather sanctimonious victim so much of the time . that said , i love these classic dramas and virtually all of them are a sight better than much of the modern drama on tv these days . so 7 stars because in spite of the irritations it's still a good watch .

2			props	little	movies	best			this is one of the best animated movies i have ever seen in my life . this isn not just a fun movie , or a well made movie . this is a landmark in the art of animation and even if it weren not , just the technical skill that went into making it , would grant it a place in the history of animation . wladyslaw starewicz created a stop motion movie about the secret life of beetles . he imagined a coherent world of insects , with jobs , houses , nightclubs , movie houses , even little props like posters and bicycles and paintings . in this movie he tells a simple tale of hypocrisy and revenge . mr beetle has an affair with a dancing dragonfly , much to the chagrin of a grasshopper ; but he's a cameraman and decides to shoot the fling . mr beetle returns home and finds mrs beetle having her own affair . mr beetle chases the lover away but forgives his wife . the two make up and go out to the movies . and the movie they watch is mr beetle and the dragonfly . described thus it sounds banal , but once seen it becomes a gripping work of cinema . along with emile cohl and jiri trnka , wladyslaw starewicz pretty much invented everything that future animators would use in their work . for that reason he must not remain forgotten .
2			it	hard	boy	little	films	similar	college	southern	owner	new	ending	amazing			i saw this film while at birmingham southern college in 1975 when it was shown in combination with the red balloon . both films are similar in their dream like quality . the bulk of the film entails a fish swimming happily in his bowl while his new owner , a little boy , is away at school . a cat enters the room where the fish and his bowl are , and begins to warily stalk his prey . the boy begins his walk home from school , and the viewer wonders whether he will arrive in time to save his fish friend . the fish becomes agitated by the cat's presence , and finally jumps out of the bowl ! the cat quickly walks over to the fish , gently picks him up with his paws , and returns him to his bowl . the boy returns happily to his fish , none the wiser . the ending is amazing in both its irony and its technical complexity . it is hard to imagine how the director could have pulled the technical feat back in 1959 it seems more a trick for 2003 if you can find it , watch it you won not be disappointed ! and if you do find it , let me know so i can get a copy , too !
2			man	old	guys	bad	line	great	stunts	best			this movie is jackie's be st i still cant get enough of watching some of his best stunts ever . i also like the bad guys in this movie the old man looks like a chinese version of john howard . unlike some of jackie's other work , this movie has also got a great story line and i recommend it to all of jackie's fans .

2			feature	entire	location	different	man	old	pleasure	real	feel	exotic	she	likable	villain	best	treasure	legendary	location	nice	dynamic	classic	fighting	great	plot	average	place	different			lupin sets off for morocco , looking for a legendary treasure . his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him . it's a nice different location for lupin , with the desert and that hot exotic feel . one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual , generally being in a different place than lupin . on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed , but it is a change of pace . plus , this way , lupin can focus on the ladies . fujiko rules in this . throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin , and us viewers . then there's lara , the damsel of this particular tale , and she's quite likable . this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime , which is a fun distinction to have . there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this , and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon , as well as some fun scenes with fujiko . inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here , in fine form . pretty much , this is a smooth ride with lupin . the plot is average and there are some slow spots , but all in all this movie is a real pleasure . enjoy .
2			god	domestic	characters	believable	i	old	characters	thrilling	gorgs	frightening	characters	likable	characters	strong			everything was better in past days . even children's television . and fraggle rock proves my point quite easily . at the time of writing this comment i am fourteen years old but even in my teen years i can not resist the charm of fraggle rock . for those of you that have indeed been living under a rock haha ! fraggle rock is about a horde of playful and goofy creatures called fraggles who live amazingly in a rock . but they are not the only creatures . the rock is inhabited with many other species like the hardworking doozers and countless living plants . outside the rock on one side live inventor scientist doc and his dog sprocket who later befriends gobo fraggle , on the other side a family of gorgs supposed rulers of the universe . the five main fraggles gobo fearless leader , mokey arty and peaceful , wembley indecisive and a friend to gobo , boober a pessimistic domestic god and red loves anything to do with sport and general feistyness get caught up in some strange situations each episode while at the same time sing and dance their cares away . fraggle rock is definitely a family show the plots may have intricate details that infants may not follow well , but the song and dance routines will hold their attention . the characters are strong and likable , their conflicts believable and their adventures thrilling . the gorgs are frightening , doc and sprocket enlightening , uncle travelling matt hilarious the postcard segments are very 80 ! and the final episode , change of address , genuinely touching . let's go down to fraggle rock again !
2			actor	great	thrillers	best	plot	unexpected	atmosphere	suck			with this movie , it's all about style , atmosphere , and acting . true , i didn not believe all of the plot developments , but it didn not matter the terrific acting , the unexpected plot twists , and the wonderful atmosphere sucked me right in , and carried me along for the ride , and i had a great time . kenneth branagh is not only a great actor but a master of accents , and he proves it once again with a flawless georgia accent . he's surrounded by so much talent in supporting roles robert downey , jr . embeth davidtz from schindler's list and fallen , tom berenger , daryl hannah , and robert duvall that i was simply blown away . i recently bought a copy of this movie , and i never tire of watching it . simply one of the best thrillers of the year . if you have ignored this movie and chances are you have , then i suggest you check it out .
2			story	original	parts	real	artwork	spectacular	trip	good	it	simple	books	comic	overtones	strong	show	best	worker	social			the internet database lists this as a tv show . and yes , it was a series on mtv shown on the oddities program , after the head and before aeon flux if i recall correctly . but the version i watched this time was a vhs tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutes . you have the story of the maxx , julie winters , sarah and mr gone . the maxx is a super hero or a bum , julie a social worker or a leopard queen , sarah a girl who should listen to less of the smiths and mr gone a guy who can not seem to keep his head on . and then there's the other weird creatures . i use or with maxx and julie , because part of the fun is trying to figure out which parts of the story are real and which are drea ms maybe they are all real or drea ms maybe one of the characters doesn not exi st maybe only one exists and dreams of the others . you will have to wait and find out . i had the comic books before the show came out , and it was one of my favorites . the artwork was spectacular and the story was original unlike anything you will find in superman or batman . it will bend your mind , and has strong adult overtones without being obscene or offensive . and the show used basically the same exact artwork only now it moves and the same story . guaranteeing that the beauty intrinsically found in the comic would be faithfully reproduced . this was the best show to appear on oddities , hands down . if you like comics of a darker nature or need a good mind trip , this is a show to check out . it's donnie darko before there was ever such a thing . the most astonishing thing is that this never went on to become another movie or television series , but i don not say this in disappointment . by keeping it simple , they have sealed this movie in gold and kept it free from the blemishes brought on by successive failures .
2			suits	strong			caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for . many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn not like it as it was not what they wanted to see . the above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you are a fan of the genre . it has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself . an absolute diamond , a film i still have on video to this day . check it out .
2			it	hard	line	simple	style	graphic	film	great	reality	futuristic	treat	visual	film	stunning	vision	superb	film	futuristic	future	new	novel	graphic	renaissance	consistent			this film is absolutely stunning . a new blade runner future noir at it's most gritty . the vision of paris is superb , both recognisable and visionary , with sweeping vistas , grungy set pieces and futuristic virtual reality . the story line is quite simple , with few surprises , but that's not what i like most about the film . it is a visual treat . done in 3 and rendered in black and white no greys ! with only one short spot of colour , it is less hard on the eyes than it sounds . there are many arty camera shots closeups and odd viewpoints but that just adds to the temperament of the film . overall you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form . i was initially under the impression that the film had been rotoscoped , such was the level of animation and high detail in the character's facial expressions . but unlike a scanner darkly which suffers from or indeed is enhanced by inconsistent character definition just watch the way some of the hair changes shape ! renaissance is consistent and precise throughout . when the character is in close up , added details and texture can bee seen , but when in mid shot or further away details are omitted , but not to the detriment of character definition . for me , the only down side of the film is that in one commentary we are told that this is a one off project . such a shame , as i would like to see more of this futuristic film noir storyline and especially in this cutting edge graphic style . oh , and the english dub is great too . all in all a great film and highly recommended .
2			characters	believable			the way the story is developed , keeps the audience wondering what is the tenant's dark pa st we get some clues during the series , but enough to keep us interested in the mini series . the characters are all believable and i personally felt immersed and surrounded by the story .

2			toe	big	people	original	it	gross	horror	modern	look	incredible	raimi	gross no	isn	gross	books	frightening	film	modern	isn	scary no			there is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror . freddie vs jason , the scream movies , cabin trash , and especially stephen king's infantile attempts he's recycled every story from the monkey's paw to whatever , often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for kubrick's version of the shining which actually was scary , unlike king's books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one , which still has the nail . but the woman in black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end . this is the way it should be done ; the director creates tension , and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face . then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close . he's learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror val lewton original cat people and robert wise a val lewton disciple and director of the haunting and the body snatcher , jacques tournier another val lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film , not the gross rubbish raimi did gross isn not scary , folks , it's just gross , and lewis allen the uninvited , and of course jack clayton's turn on henry james the innocents , and the way the master of suspense , hitchcock , can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like under capricorn . ten stars .
2			love	true	acting	incredible	moments	realistic	movie	boring	classic	romantic	characters	perfect no			amazing movie that , in theory , should be boring but is delivered with subtlety and incredible acting that i have long despaired of ever finding . instead of relying on clichs and overly dramatized moments the plot unfolds through a series of incredibly realistic moments . the lead characters are not perfect , and so relating to them as people you could know is easy . the movie is not trying to pull laughs , or push an ideal onto the audience but simply showing us the possibility of true love in any circumstance . i am now restless waiting for the weekend so i can see the sequel . a moving , thought provoking , funny look at love that i think should be an absolute romantic classic up there with casablanca and breakfast at tiffany's . will soften even the hardiest heart .

2			king	original	thing	good	it	great	it	crazy			everyone , my name may sound weird , but there was nothing else ! any way , i haven not seen anything like this before so it was crazy ! of course that's a good thing . it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one ! like chicken little , the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying , twas beauty who killed the beast , war of the worlds scene and more . walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one . also , how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema . however some parts don not fit . like in the original lion king , weren not timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar ? in this movie , they are not ! they were fighting the hyenas backstage . ther's more , the reason being why pumbaa isn not so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also , it's just timon , timon , timon . anybody realise that only timonn's story was told , whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks ? but apart from that , it s great !

2			subjects	religious	thriller	good	suspense	flawless	comments	previous	shows	great	players	best			strange enough , all the previous comments merely described the beginning and left the details over . i feel a necessity to confirm that this is a family work , since marina vlady was also robert hossein's wife , and the excellent jazz music was written by te director's father , andr under these circumstances , no wonder it was a really good thriller , seen when issued and immediately identified with the music . the suspense was flawless , and maintained throughout until the end . robert hossein , at the time one of the best european players , managed to impose himself also as a top screen and stage director . he's still putting up great stage shows , with a preference for religious subjects . harry carasso , paris , france
2			it	wonderful	story	different	it	available			i absolutely loved this movie . i am not even sure what particularly about it but i think it was wonderful and should be available for dvd . the women were strangers and yet got along well enough to spend the time they did in the villa in italy . the actors , in my opinion , did an excellent job . the characters were all so different and yet clever story that made it work . there is humor , drama and relationship issues all in good time . this requires 10 lines but i just can not think of any more to say so i will just rattle on until i get 10 lines . so sorry about this . what else can i possibly say it has been a long time since i last saw it . i am looking forward to view again but it isn not available .
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			the idea's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies , not neccessarily the united states itself . it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves . 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie .
2			show	old	it	entertaining	i	wrong			this movie pretty much surprised me . i didn not have very high expectations for it but i was wrong . mary & rhoda was very funny and well written . they didn not spend too much time rehashing the past so they weren not relying on the success of the old tv show to carry the movie . overall it was very entertaining . my girlfriend commented that this could be a weekly sit com and i think i might agree with her .
2			york	new	message	good	it	entertaining	film	good	news	real	side	liberal			as someone who lives near buffalo , new york , this movie scored points with me before i even saw it , since the story is based here . there are even some bit parts with real life news tv anchor people from , for once , it doesn not knock the area . hallelujah ! theology wise , puh leeze ! ! god is still made to look and think like , of course , be a bit on the liberal side . being the lightweight comedy it is , it's nothing that should win any awards but it still is entertaining and is a pleasant way to kill 102 minutes . there are some laugh out loud slapstick comedy scenes and , hopefully , audiences from christians to atheists . got something out of this besides a few laughs , such as what prayer should really be all about . kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message . overall , it's a good hearted film that should offend very few .
2			types	different	thought	spiritual	men	old	effects	special	folks	solid	people	old	occasions	different	they	intelligent	film	horrible	haze	alcoholic	theater	wrong			i have seen this movie on several different occasions . i find one of the funniest things to do is to just watch the reactions of the different types of people who go to see it . type 1 old people . a lot of old japanese men and women go to this movie because they think it will be a honest to goodness samurai movie with lots of swordplay and medieval japanese dialogue . as soon the two protagonists begin debating horror movies while inserting expletives almost randomly throughout their sentences , the old people walk out , usually disgusted . type 2 film snobs . these people think that just because a movie bears the label of independent that it will automatically be a load of hard to follow , overemotional crap that may or may not be in english . yet they see it anyway just to sing praises about it later so that people will think they are intelligent and cultured . they are really in for a surprise when they see this film . as soon as the blood begins to squirt exaggeratedly from anime inspired sword battles or the over the top villain nonchalantly pegs a dog with his crossbow during a phone conversation , these people will be so dismayed , they will walk out . a few will stay just to see how bad it will get and later they will rave about what a horrible film it was to their friends . type 3 people expecting to see live action anime or matrix like special effects . sorry folks , the martial arts are pretty solid in the film , but director yamasato really doesn not have the budget for that kind of thing . type 4 people with no expectations . these are the people who really enjoy the film . whether they had only heard of blood of the samurai , picked it at random , or stumbled into the wrong theater in an alcoholic haze , these are the people who will laugh at all the jokes and appreciate the movie for what it ultimately is entertainment . this movie was not made to enlighten or to provoke deep spiritual thought , it was meant if i may borrow a line of dialogue from the film to really kick some ass . and that's what it does . so depending on what type of person you are , you may or may not enjoy this film ; however , if you appreciate the movie for what it is and can enjoy an excess of blood and acting , then go see this movie and make sure to bring your friends .

2			life	real	people	proud	play	live	movie	great			peter falk is a diverse and accomplished actor . the movie is well written and the acting seems like real life . for all lovers of columbo this is a superior piece of work . because it shows what a talent peter falk is . he doesn not play a detective he plays a retired carpet salesman . by the time the credits begin to role you already want to watch it again . the interesting part of the movie is that the message will apply to every person that watches it ; the depth of its pertinence will be the only thing that varies . it is a shame that the liberals in hollywood only promote smut and skin because this is the type of movie that the people in the business should be proud of . this would be a great movie to turn into a live stage play .

2			version	low	miller	interesting	scenes	nice	card	lucky	performances	special			saw this flick on encw last nite for the third or fourth time . enjoyed it so much i ordered the dvd . this really is a standout and of course the first of the mann stewart pairings . more here than the usual oater , although not quite as powerful as the searchers . lots of obvious symbolism about achieving manhood but mainly it's the acting by stewart , his partner millard mitchell , shelly winters and the waco johnny dean dan duryea . steve miller not the joker is interesting as a handsome would be hero who's interested in lola but too yellow . like stewart in the man who killed liberty valance , he's practically reduced to putting on an apron and serving his enemies coffee . decaf no doubt . tony curtis from the bronx cavalry and rock hudson behaving like no indian i have seen on screen have interesting cameos . special performances by john mcintire as a too lucky card dealing / gun trader who hangs out at a very low grade western version of rick's american cafe . nobody wants to spend the night there . jay flippens out over a kiss from lola winters and has some nice scenes with stewart before he gets to bend of the river and far country . will geer as wyatt earp and the indian chief who takes walter brennan's teeth from him in red river are pleasant sightings . this is the kind of western that only stewart , not wayne nor scott could have pulled off . worth the shot , i repeat .

2			tale	human			just kidding about the weight loss thing ; well , you might lose weight you never know . anyway , what can i say , i love this film . it has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like stand by me and the goonies . jake's closet illustrates the beauty of life's simple things and how often we overlook them . the film reminds us what it's like to see the world through children's eyes and all the magic , mystery , and horror they perceive . jake's closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who's had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with . watch it with friends ; watch it with loved ones ; build a fort wine optional .

2			acting	great			if the redundancy of getting off the boat , on the boat , off the bus , on the bus . is a way to waste time then you should go back to the hollywood films that wrap this part up in one montage in order to get to the money shots . and in doing so leave you unconnected and in the cinematic limbo that results from not really showing the realities of life . the long drawn out travel sequences actually allow the viewer the same frustration and wait in line feeling the characters must endure . frustrating ? yes . vital ? indeed . the limbo of that travel is the key to the rootlessness of this turkish family . beautiful film with great acting . sad , but worth it .
2			episodes	new	things	great	series	good			im really addicted to caprica , because it's a really good prequel series to battlestar galactica . it really has a slow pace start , but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air . i have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season . this sci fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres . eric stoltz does an amazing job , as well as polly walker as clarice willow ! totally worth checking out ! catch caprica on fridays at 9 m / 8 m central on syfy

2			epic	romantic	film	moving	soundtrack	finest	way	bad	he	brilliant	acting	wonderful	titanic	different	it	satisfying	dialogue	memorable			for me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time . no exceptions . james cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller . through films such as aliens , the abyss and both terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science fiction goes . he sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film . but titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance . the film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises , plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows . the story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for cameron to make a truthful , interesting and entertaining film about it . the acting is wonderful as leonardo dicaprio who plays jack and kate winslet who plays rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films i get annoyed when the supporting characters aren not given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly rose gloria stuart tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is rose's and jack's story alone , no one else . emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home . the music has become iconic and legendary . it is composer james horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience . the song after so long has become annoying but i still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is . only one problem , the usual james cameron problem , is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside . james cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime . my heart won not go on from this one .

2			script	priceless	script	entire	leads	fantastic	ones	memorable	list	endless			i have loved this movie ever since it's debut in 1981 i have lost track of how many times i have seen it ! it never fails to make me laugh or cheer me up if i am feeling down . the three leads are fantastic and the script is priceless , plus how do you not get nostalgic hearing the theme song ? i think i quote this movie without realizing it . i basically know the entire script , so when someone is watching it for the first time i have to hold back saying something about how funny the next line it . i can not even narrow it down , although , sir john's character probably gets the most memorable ones . the famous i will alert the media when arthur announces his intention to take a bath is still priceless , but the list is truly endless . the scene's at arthur's soon to be fianc's father's house are a scream , particularly his interactions with the moose . do yourself a favour and see this movie !

2			movie	good			a lot of people are saying that al pacino over acted but i mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent . this movie overall was a really good movie i myself rated a 10 10 i would highly recommend people to watch this movie .
2			story	appealing no	films	best	picture	realistic	eila	worth	finland	contemporary	town	central			excellent movie , a realistic picture of contemporary finland , touching and profound . one of the best finnish films ever made . captures marvelously the everyday life in a central finland small town , people's desires and weaknesses , joys and sorrows . the bright early fall sunshine creates a cool atmosphere to this lucid examination of people in a welfare society . lampela is indeed one of the most promising finnish filmmakers . he shows that it is possible to make gripping movies without machine guns and bloodshed . his next film eila is also worth seeing although the story of cleaning women fighting for their jobs is not quite as universally appealing as the destinies in joki .
2			lloyd	nice	duvall	artificial	score	ingenious	rest	brilliant	it	easy	duvall	nice	lloyd	artificial	portrayal	authentic	name	greatest	film	entire	performances	greatest			kubrick again puts on display his stunning ability to craft a perfect ambiance for a film . mainly through cinematography , but also using an ingenious score , he creates a chilling and ominous tone that resides over the entire film and thoroughly gets my spine tingling from the start . it really is this flawless ambiance that makes the shining the masterpiece that it is , in my eyes . of course it doesn not hurt that jack nicholson gives one of the greatest performances i have ever seen . a frighteningly authentic portrayal of a mind gone mad . duvall and lloyd are artificial , to be nice , but it's easy to look past those two when the rest of the film is so brilliant . plus it features the actor with the greatest name of all time scatman crothers .
2			strangeness	true	treat	real	seem	improvised	balance	precious	directors	modern	world	realistic			saw this my last day at the festival , and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days . poetic , moving , and most surprisingly , funny , in it's own strange way . it's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper realistic world , without seeming precious , or upsetting the balance . manages to seem both improvised , yet completely controlled . it i hesitate to make comparisons , because these filmmakers have really digested their influences cassavetes , malick , loach , usual suspects and found their own unique style , but if you like modern directors in this tradition lynne ramsay , david gordon greene , you are in for a real treat . this is a wonderful film , and i hope more people get to see it . if this film plays in a festival in your city , go ! go ! go !

2			i	glad	gem	little	movies	comic	felt	bored	movie	rich	kick	big			i am so glad that i got a chance to see this rare little gem of a movie . i saw it at an independent film festival , so don not expect it to come to your town anytime soon . during the film , i noticed about 10 people get up and walk out . too bad for them down here in the south , folks don not like having to read subtitles . the movie starts out slow , but is so rich in dialogue that i never felt bored . when the action finally arrives , i found myself glued to the screen as if i were riding a roller coaster . i also got a big kick of the chapter titles appearing before the chapters , especially the ones that introduce the characters as they appear on screen . it reminded me of zelda ocarina of time when you face level bosses . if this is the future of video game / comic book movies , then i welcome it .

2			actors	real	seem	real	generation	new	thrillers	famous	level	new	scenario	simplistic			just like final fantasy brought cg to a whole new level , this is a rebirth for motion capture . neither movie nor cartoon , this motion picture looks like a homage to the film noir , akira , sin city , blade runner and the new generation of european cartoonists . you see paris the way it almost could be , the characters seem as real as you and they blink , trip , shiver like real actors in a way never achieved before . don not go watch it hoping to find a mind twister . you will most likely figure it out before you are half way from the movie . the scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers , but this definitely is bliss for the eyes .

what a beautiful day it is ! la furia del hombre lobo was written by paul naschy in a hurry . original director enrique eguilez was fired and replaced by jos mara zabalza , a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production . he was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited . zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of naschy's previous movies , mark of the wolfman . the scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different , and helped pad out the runtime after zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie . post production was a nightmare . nobody knew who was doing the editing , the money ran out , the master print disappeared for a while , and then at a pre release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater . he was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb . yet somehow the film works , if you let it . it keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles , vaulted catacombs , chains , whips , gloomy moors . fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn not make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution . in one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning ; in the next shot its bone dry and he's howling at the full moon . then its raining again . and yet you don not look at it as a gaffe . its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible , opposites are the same , and effects proceed causes ; first the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams , and then the cable starts sparking with electricity . people say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness i say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend . it is a marvel of making something out of nothing , and succeeds not because of what it could of had , but because of what it does . it's easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it . the trick is being able to see through the mayhem , or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect . paul naschy died last week at the age of 75 he had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more , was working on film projects right up until his last days , but passed away in madrid , spain , with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment . his rich , varied , and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disintere st and yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like fury of the wolfman in rapt awe . even people who don not like euro horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at , if only for just a minute in a couple spots . you can find it for free at or even buy it on a dvd for a nickel . it's worth far , far more . amusingly , naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted , sick , demented little movie as a classic , if not an outright masterpiece of cinema dementia . the problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for naschy to forgive . i would never presume to dare to forgive it for him , but i will say this i would rather watch fury of the wolfman in its dingiest , most cut and degraded fullscreen public domain print than ever sit though the overbearing , obnoxious crap churning out up at the swine flu cineplexes this or any other weekend . the world lost a great artist this month . watch his films , and remember . 9 10

2			hazards	outrageous	one	good	job	best	you	disappointed no	movie	bad	guy	bad	part	scary no			small spoiler herein ! when i looked at the votes for creep today , i was surprised about so many imdb users rating this movie 1 . i am wondering what do people expect of such kind of movie ? are there so many people watching a movie without knowing anything about it ? creep is a horror movie and it is a pretty good one ! this automatically means it has a absurd story full of holes , outrageous hazards and simple one side characters . so why complain about it ? just take some popcorn and coke , make yourself comfortable in your seat and then . enjoy to be scared to death ! the first 60 minutes when there is almost nothing else than kate and a lonely subway station are incredibly scaring . there is suspense and fear in every corner of the screen and you will give some jerks just because of a sudden sound of a blinking neon lamp in the back of you . in my opinion the sound editor did the best job in this movie . when kate meet her pursuer the quality of the movie drops but it still doesn not become a bad movie . the second part of the movie is not scary at all , but the gore effects are well done and the story is quite well developed . long as you keep in mind that it is a horror movie you are watching and not the discovery channel ! so , if you want to make yourself a very , very scaring hour . just watch the first hour of creep and then leave the cinema or turn of your tv . you know the rest of the story anyway , don not you ? the bad guy will die and kate will be the only survivor . but even if you watch this movie up to its end , you will not be disappointed . if you want to push anxiety to the next level , do what i did after watching this movie leave the cinema by dark night , go to the next subway station and take the last train home .

2			level	unexpected	extremities	disturbing			extremities is the disturbing , yet riveting screen version of a play by william mastriosimone who adapted his own play for the screen about a woman who is attacked in her car one night by a would be rapist on her way home and is terrified when she realizes the man got her purse and knows where she lives . after her roommates leave for work the next day , the guy shows up at her home and attempts to rape her . the story takes a surprising twist when , at one point , the woman turns the tables on the man and is able to overpower him ; but when she realizes there is no way that attempted rape can be proved and if the man is arrested , he will just get off , she decides to keep him prisoner in the house until she can get a confession out of him . far fetched ? maybe . disturbing ? definitely , but there's a wonderfully claustrophobic feel about this film , especially the middle with just the woman and her attacker , that you can not help but feel completely a part of what's going on . i did not see the play on broadway , but i would imagine a piece like this works better onstage , but that doesn not make this film any less riveting an experience . farrah fawcett , one of the last actresses to do the role on broadway , was awarded the role of marjorie in the film version and delivers a taut and deeply moving performance as the victim who refuses to be a victim . many critics found fawcett's performance to be one note , but for me , marjorie is a woman completely numbed by what she has been through and the performance works for me . james russo , in the performance of his career , is slimy and menacing as the would be rapist who finds marjorie to be much more of a challenge than he assumed . alfre woodard and diana scarwid co star as marjorie's roommates , who come home after marjorie has overpowered the guy and has him tied up and stuffed in their fireplace upon their arrival . and it's the arrival of the roommates that take the story to an unexpected level because they didn not see what we saw marjorie go through and therefore , think she should call the police and let them handle the guy . not for the faint of heart , but if you can stand it , a gripping film experience anchored by a lead performance that will surprise you .

2			hammy	little	gordon	good	holes	various	music	good			i like this episode quite a bit , ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was . as has been stated , the music is very good , and it has a moodiness that doesn not exist in all episodes . but one major plot hole exists , so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it . it is established that the light doesn not work in the vault . don not you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked ? you would think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note . granted this is tv whodunit fiction , and various holes will always be found , but this seems much too glaring . it really doesn not make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn not work but the death bed testimony goes on unfound , apparently for days .

another reason i thought i wouldn not care for the movie is that i hate the boston red sox . my whole family hates em . the mere mention of pedro martinez name sends me running to the bathroom . oh man , hold on . right , i m back . anyway , my mom , who is a st louis cardinals fan , still believes the world series was rigged last year . she refuses to believe the sox won it legitimately . but i m man enough to admit that fever pitch caused me to sympathize , albeit only slightly , with the plight of red sox fans . anybody who has a passion for sports will be able to relate to this movie on some level . unless you have a favorite sports team you can not fully understand the extreme highs and lows that a fan such as fallon's ben can go through . there's nothing quite so fresh as the smell of a new season and nothing quite so smooth as a clean slate . well , figuratively speaking . it's the joy of being a sports fan . wait not il next year , becomes your mantra , your motto , your prayer and fever pitch effectively captures that essence . i love the fact that the movie takes a fictional story and throws it against the real life backdrop of the red sox improbable world series run last year . i don not love it so much that i want to marry it , but you know what i mean . i expected this to be handled in a fairly cheesy manner , and while some of the humor is a little silly , it's actually pretty realistic . you see , ben's uncle took him to his first red sox game when he was 7 years old , and when he died he left ben his two season tickets . ben hasn not missed a game in 23 years . at the beginning of each season he has a draft day where he and his friends get together to figure out who gets to go to which games with him . he makes everybody dance for the yankees games and whenever somebody complains he threatens them with tickets for the games with the royals sorry mr shade and the devil rays . it's a very good scene , and it works so well because i actually know of people who do the ticket draft day . i also must admit that i can relate to when ben goes to dinner with lindsey and her parents . the red sox are playing a road game , but instead of watching it live on tv ben decides to tape it . one of the most dangerous things in life is taping a game and then being in public and trying to avoid hearing the result . been there . it's a very tense and scary situation . weeeeeell , ben enters the danger zone when a guy shows up at the restaurant and mentions watching the game . ben immediately covers his ears and starts shrieking like a banshee so as not to hear the outcome . lindsey is embarrassed , and her parents don not know what to think . yeah , sports fans can be weird , i don not deny it . but it's real . now if you are expecting the crude , edgy stuff that the farrelly brothers are known for then you could be disappointed . they do have their moments though , like when ben says he likes how lindsey sometimes talks out of the side of her mouth like an adorable stroke victim , but overall this is definitely a softer , more romantic side that the bros are putting on display . that's not to say that the movie ever gets way too sappy . thankfully , when the sap starts to ooze a bit , the farrellys know when to pull away . a romantic moment with lindsey jumping on the field and running over to ben to declare her undying love for him turns into ben sincerely replying , you have gotta tell me about the outfield . is it spongy ? jimmy fallon proves that with the right material he can handle himself well on the big screen , and drew barrymore remains a constant source of romantic comedy charm . fever pitch is just good , solid entertainment that takes a somewhat fresh look at the romantic comedy genre . it's a movie that guys and gals can both relate to . particularly the guys who practice sports fanaticism at some point during the year and the ladies who must deal with em . now if the red sox fans could please shut up about the curse of the bambino i would appreciate it . my memphis tigers have never won the ncaa basketball championship , so i officially declare my plight greater than yours . the gist fans of jimmy fallon , drew barrymore , romantic comedy , the red sox , baseball , or sports fanaticism in general should consider giving fever pitch a look . i wouldn not go out of my way to rush and see it at the first available time , but it will make a great matine . rating 3.25 out of 5

2			kind	old	movie	scary	andres	potential	filmmakers	professional			the thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays andre and calvin as relatively normal guys . these are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera , forget scripted lines , etc they are only making the video as a diary to show not he survivors how normal their lives were . their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video . by researching other kids attacks on their schools , andre and calvin learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly not his old house kind of way any potential andres and calvins who might be watching this video how to make bombs , get weapons , and not get caught before zero day the day of the attack .
2			competition	realistic	ride	realistic	content	great	roll	little	competition	easy	it	easy	reviewer	previous	none	dimensional	acting	believable			i must give how she move a near perfect rating because the content is truly great . as a previous reviewer commented , i have no idea how this film has found itself in imdbs bottom 100 list ! that's absolutely ridiculous ! other films particular those that share the dance theme can not hold a candle to this one in terms of its combination of top notch , believable acting , and amazing dance routines . from start to finish the underlying story this is not just about winning a competition is very easy to delve into , and surprisingly realistic . none of the main characters in this are 2 dimensional by any means and , by the end of the film , it's very easy to feel emotionally invested in them . and , even if you are not the crying type , you might get a little weepy eyed before the credits roll . i definitely recommend this film to dance lovers and , even more so , to those who can appreciate a poignant and well acted storyline . how she move isn not perfect of course what film is ? but it's definitely a cut above movies that use pretty faces to hide a half baked plot and / or characters who lack substance . the actors and settings in this film make for a very realistic ride that is equally enthralling thanks to the amazing talent of the dancers !
2			she	good	she	brilliant	performance	best	singing	funny no	it	beautiful	use	reminiscent			this is one of my two or three favorite stooges shorts , and undoubtedly christine mcintyre's best performance with the trio . she is good in a number of other shorts , but here she is absolutely brilliant . her singing is not funny at all , in fact it is downright beautiful , but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it . we listen to mcintyre sing the entirety of voice of spring no less than three times , but it never gets old , partly because we don not tire of her voice , and partly because it blends so well with the stooges antics . the use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of kitty carlisle's role in the marx brothers a night at the opera , but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in opera , and mcintyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that carlisle never did . the stooges buffoonery , mcintyre's singing , and a well constructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars .
2			attempts	poor	document	incredible	challenges	incredible	lebanon	modern			they probably could have skipped some of the beginning i m not sure why this starts out in the asian part of turkey . if it was because starting in the mediterranean , they could have gotten closer starting in modern day lebanon . one the cameras and crews get to the bakhtyari tribe , it's the beginning of an amazing 48 day journey . 50 000 people with about 250 000 goats , camels , cattle , and horses make this amazing trek across what seems to be a very fast moving karun river . they use rafts that are kept afloat by inflating goat skins you can see where the head and legs were removed . the other bank of the river was very steep i m guessing about a 60 degree rise . just watching that was incredible , but there was much more to come . to get to the pastures , they also had to cross a major mountain that had about 4 feet of snow , if not more . being able to climb this mountain was pretty amazing in and of itself , but they and all of the animals climbed this mountain barefoot ! yes , barefoot . the one drawback to this documentary were some of the inter titles with poor attempts at humor . if you want to see a documentary from the silent era , or the incredible challenges that this tribe not only face , but conquer . this is just an incredible document of a little known group of people facing all kinds of challenges .
2			film	enjoyable	film	fantastic	miller	fantastic	directing	great			i totally agree that nothing is a fantastic film ! i have not laughed so much when watching a film for ages ! and david hewlett and andrew miller are fantastic in this ! they really work well together ! this film may not appeal to some people i can not really say why without spoiling it ! but each to their own ! i loved it and highly recommend it ! the directing is great and some of the shots are very clever . it looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming it ! although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to watch .
2			they	cute	me	surprised	i	old	i	little	movie	wonderful	heaven	beautiful	movie	great			may contain spoilers all dogs go to heaven is a great movie . i saw it in 1989 when i was two years old . i didn not understand it that well but as i saw it more and more times i started to love it . i love the songs in this movie . my favorite songs are let me be surprised and soon you will come home . those are beautiful songs . the only thing that bothers me about the movie is charlie dieing . when i was little my sister couldn not even watch that part . other than that this movie is wonderful . my favorite part of the movie is when annabelle and charlie are flying around heaven . heaven is beautiful in the movie and the clocks are very clever . i also love itchy , in fact i have 3 dachshunds of my own . they are so cute . overall i love this movie and suggest everyone should see it . i give this movie 10 10 stars .
2			men	sharp			unique movie about confused woman lindsay crouse who gets involved with sharp con men . joe mantegna gives an oscar caliber performance as the slickest of the group . absolutely enchanting first hour , as mantegna shows crouse the ropes of his con games . story line unravels a bit later on , but still stands as a unique portrayal of an innocent caught up in a dark world . definitely worth a shot .
2			film	great	film	classic	seems	dated	form	best	performances	great	story	good	songs	great	personalities	real	hilarity	eventual	picture	best	being	great	sinatra	new	story	classic	winner	eventual	one	different			usually musicals in the 1940 s were of a set formula and if you studied films you know what i m talking about a certain running lenghth , very showy performances that were great on the surface but never got into the real personalities of the characters etc this one is different and light years better and well worth it's nomination for best picture of the year 1945 although had no chance of beating the eventual winner lost weekend . gene kelly was probably in the best form of his career yes i know about american in paris and singing in the rain . this one is different . he really gets into his character of a sea wolf thinking at first that picking up any girl while on leave is nothing more than a lark . and if you had to make up a story to get her so be it until . sort of like the music man when he gets his foot caught in the door . the eventual hilarity of the film stems mostly from his and his new pal sinatra 's attempt to make the story good in order to get the girl that he really and unexpectedly falls in love with . you are going to have to see the movie to see what i mean . besides that there are so many other elements of great film in this one , it's a classic buddy story , nostalgia to a time when wwii was almost over the war ended about a month after the films release , a realization that a guy that always laughed at life can find out that he really is a great human being , great songs and probably a few other elements of classic film making that i can not think of right now . why not a 10 near the end at nearly 2 1 2 hours starts to feel a bit long . there is a small ballet number that gene kelly does that must have been a sensation in 1945 but seems dated and feels like it just adds minutes now . but overall , this ones a definite winner on every level .
2			movie	great	teller	great			of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime . rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy . he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing . so rodolfo sonego did . if you check out his biography , you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy . alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories . my uncle visited australia and my town , in 1968 to check out locations for a girl in australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war . you can see his humor in all his movies . i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently . great
2			feeling	happy	legends	historical	figures	historical	it	amazing	anime	emotional			i have to agree with everyone else that has posted . i watched it quite a while ago but i will tell you , whenever i hear certain music from this anime i am reminded of the story , the beautiful animation , the characters and the feeling i got when watching it , and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling . i do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn not explain things properly but it didn not ruin any part of the viewing experience . i was into this anime so much that after the end i just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and i found all my answers and a whole lot more . i love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime , it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more . i have always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime i do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely . i would recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story , well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action . also , even though this was based on a h game it doesn not have any of that stuff in it and i actually prefer it this way . i have no problem with mature anime , in most cases i prefer it
2			acting	great	actor	great	garcia	hilarious	characters	great	twists	unexpected	show	best	garcia	great	shows	greatest			this show is without a doubt one of the greatest shows ever to be on television . i mean the acting is great , the suspense , the drama , the comedy , it has everything , and with such a simple story a plane crashed on an island . the characters are great and evangeline lilly is hot ! ! ! matthew fox once again shows us what a great actor he is , josh holloway is so great , jorge garcia is hilarious , i could go on and on . also , the unexpected plot twists , the back stories of the characters , the music that is at the end of every episode . j . j . abrahms has once again proved what an excellent writer and producer he is . i mean this is better than alias , and i loved alias . whoever isn not watching this show , should definitely consider getting the dvd's and watching it , because they are missing something great . this show could possibly be the best show in television history !
2			actors	funny	hastings	local	movies	good	store	local			i love this movie . my friend marcus and i were browsing the local hastings because we had an urge to rent something we had never seen before and stumbled across this fine film . we had no idea what it was going to be about , but it turned out spectacular . 2 thumbs up . i liked how the film was shot , and the actors were very funny . if you are are looking for a funny movie that also makes you think i highly suggest you quickly run to your local video store and find this movie . i would tell you some of my favorite parts but that might ruin the film for you so i won not . this movie is definitely on my top 10 list of good movies . do you really think nothing is bouncy ?
2			timing	comic	standing	great	effects	special	look	cute	thing	greatest	scenes	romantic	effects	superb	movie	great			this is a great movie . i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink , and the skeletons chase him , but luckily he dodged them , opened the window , and didn not even notice them . xiao qian is very pretty too . & when he stuck the needle up ma wu's butt , its hysterical . and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too . then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people . then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves . the love scenes are romantic , xiao qian and ning look cute together . add the comic timing , the giant tongue , and u have horror , romance , comedy , all at once . not to mention superb special effects for the 90 .
2			it	strange	vision	different	life	spiritual	stories	empty	fight	old	one	chaotic	stories	good			the first thing i thought when i saw this films was it is not really a film , at least it is not what we imagine spontaneously when we hear the word film . it is entirely symbolic , everything in it has a figurative meaning . so if you are not used to express thing in a symbolic way , you will find it strange , if you are not acquainted with philosophy , religion , spiritual life , you will think it's just a fairy tale . and even a weird one , chaotic . for me the legend of zu is perfectly transparent . and i do like it . it tells us in images the story about the fight between light and darkness , the fight that is as old as humanity , and every one who is in search of the sens in this life is confronted with it . the film is obviously made by buddhists . i am not a buddhi st my religion and the vision of the world and human is different . but as far as we are all humans and have the same human nature we necessarily have common experiences and can understand each other . it is a really beautiful film ! and i which we had more films like this films that have a meaning . there are too many empty stories which are good only to make time pass more quickly .
2			ms	open	pickens	easy	force	entire	perlman	poor	she	adorable	creatures	suck	i	aware	target	fresh	tanya	poor	minutes	loose	angle	incestuous	someone	different	target	new	works	serious			there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn not direct a horror film of quality if he had to . and , sleepwalkers . screenplay written by stephen king is often used as an example of this . i like sleepwalkers , though i fully am aware that garris just says f ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie . forget character or plot development , who needs them anyway . it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of sleepwalkers . feline human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents , moving from town to town , living a nomadic existence , truly powerful set their sights on a teenager who doesn not surrender without a fight . before all is said and done , many will be slaughtered as a mother shan not tolerate the possible death of her beloved son . garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed , as a teacher glenn shadix , suspecting handsome , all american charmer charles brady brian krause to be someone entirely different from who he claims , gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into . charles lures pretty virgins into his arms , drawing their energy , in turn feeding his hungry mama , mary alice krige . the fresh new target is tanya robertson mdchen amick , and she seems to be easy pickens , but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle . thanks to a deputy's cat , clovis , mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way . mary , come hell or high water , will retrieve tanya in the goal of refreshing her dying son . like many teenagers , i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies . such as amy dolenz , i was smitten with mdchen amick . she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles , unaware of his ulterior motives . i just knew that mdchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen , but this would never be the case . too bad because i would have welcomed her in the genre with open ar ms krige is yummy as the menacing , damn sexy , but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop , in less than ten or so minutes . she stabs one in the back with a corn cob ! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman , before cracking his arm . a bone protruding , knocking him unconscious with his own elbow ! she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face ! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles cop kebab ! falling on the pencil for extra impact . poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary , driven to the brady home , and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster ! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans . we see mary and charles abilities to dim themselves and his car using a power of invisibility . writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers , joe dante and john landis as photograph experts . the film is shot in a tongue in cheek , let it all hang out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home . it's about the ultra violence , simple as that , with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris direction and king's screenplay . the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in your face . without a lick of complexity , this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works .
2			it	harsh	cities	modern	cities	big	it	cruel	things	present	ends	emotional	ends	dead			dog days is one of most accurate films i have ever seen describing life in modern cities . it's very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly it's very close to reality . isolation , desperation , deep emotional dead ends , problematic affairs , perversion , complexes , madness . all the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today . it makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society . the negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly . i only wish it was a lie . unfortunately , it isn not . therefore . .10 10
2			entertainment	good	cousin	good	matt	good	part	personal	seemed	interesting			this film is an hour or so of good entertainment and has some genuinely funny moments . i loved the character of matt , and also tiny . they seemed the most engaging and funny characters , and certainly the most interesting . matt is very good as is his no good cousin , and the police woman and the blonde biker woman provide some welcome eye candy . i must say i saw striking similarities between matt and another aussie actor , eric bana . my personal favourite part was the brothel scene , loved that . overall , i liked the film and it will get about an 8 rating . the penalty however , i was disappointed in . it was a side foot curl , rather than the appropriate laces bla st i am of course kidding .
2			case	good	movie	best	cinema	best			simply put , this is the best movie to come out of michigan since . well , ever ! evil dead eat your heart out , hatred of a minute was some of the oddest , and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time . i recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip , or a good case of the willies !
2			design	superb			louis sachar's compelling children's classic is about as disney as freddy krueger . it's got murder , racism , facial disfigurement and killer lizards . tightly plotted , it's a multi layered , interlinking story that spans history to reveal stanley's own heritage and the secret behind the holes . it races from latvia's lush greenness to the pock marked camp green lake hint there's no lake and no green . disney's first success is re creating the novel's environments so convincingly the set design is superb and without gloss . the other plus is in the casting . rising star shia labeouf charlie's angels 2 project greenlight might not be the fat boy of the book , but his attitude is right and he's far from the usual clean cut hero . the rest of the cast is filled out equally well , from patricia arquette as the frontier school marm turned bank robber to henry winkler as stanley's dad . the downside is the pop soundtrack pure marketing department and having the sentiment turned up to full volume at the end .

2			feelings	intense	man	dead			i haven not seen this in over 20 rs but i still remember things about it . this film could not have been made in color . the stark grays are what make it , and was life really that simple in the 1950 s ? what stands out the most in my memory is perry smith going to the gallows . his breathing under the hood just before they sprung the trap . i don not think i could watch that is plenty . it's like that unnamed guy at the beginning of papillon who is dragged out in terror to the guillotine . the guy that said watch this on a double bill with dead man walking should have added the last 10 minutes of i want to live as well . some of my ancestors being aristos went to the guillotine in 1794 -95 so my feelings on the death penalty are rather intense .

2			anything	bad no	order	special	vhs	original	shop	original	shop	little	it	great	people	recognizable	fan	big	person	real	price	ridiculous	movie	great			this is a great movie if viewed in the proper context it was meant to be a parody of teen horror devil worship movies and the 80 saw plenty of them ! i saw this movie when it first came out , and instantly liked it . being a big fan of kiss , it was great to see gene in the movie . and anything with ozzy as a metal hating preacher can not be all bad ! also , fastway was already a favorite of mine , so it was great to hear them on the soundtrack . the original vhs this was pre dvd cover for trick or treat featured an illustration of sammi kneeling , playing his guitar in a ring of fire with a demon looking on . it was a special order , and the price for the vhs copy at the time circa 1987 was $ 90 i really wanted the movie , but not at that ridiculous price . the ozzy gene cover was only created for the $ 5 re release . the company releasing it probably figured gene and ozzy were the only recognizable people in the movie , so they had better put em on the cover ! same thing with the original little shop of horrors jack nicholson was in it for all of five minutes , but now they have him on the cover as if he were the main star . i have a trick or treat web site , and it's surprising how many people believe sammi curr was a real person ! fastway helped perpetuate that myth by dedicating their soundtrack album to 'sammi curr . all in all , it was just a good time , rock n roll movie . definitely not to be taken too seriously , but just enjoyed !
2			neighbourhood	new	repercussions	unexpected	nature	personal			a classy film pulled in 2 directions . to its advantage it is directed by wes craven . on the downside the tv film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget . it moves along as susan lucci draws robert urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club . his latest invention , a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood . anyone seeing this should pay attention to susan lucci . her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later . the actor , scientist and parapsychologist stephen armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film . lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called catherine . lucci and barbara steele's portrait in black sunday were used as references for the catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by armourae . probably due to a personal nature between the artist and catherine . so by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film .
2			path	personal	variety	wide	self	old			reading a wide variety of scoop reviews over the past few days , i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody . happily , i couldn not have been more wrong . granted , woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two , but woody the writer / director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self into the story . judging from the laughter and guffaws , the audience ate up allen's one liners and dialogue in a way that i haven not seen in several years . in a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs , twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies , it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path .
2			story	simple	documentary	complete	sequences	intense	foes	traditional			from the filmmakers who brought us the march of the penguins , i guess that came with plenty of expectations for the fox and the child . from the harsh winters of the south pole to the lush wilderness in france , the narrative now becomes part documentary and part fairy tale , which tells of the friendship between the two titular characters , renard the fox and its friendship with the child who christened it , played by bertille noel beuneau . the story's frankly quite simple , and at times this movie would have looked like the many japanese movies which children miscellaneous animals striking a friendship after the development of trust , and how they go about hanging around each other , dealing with respective adversaries and the likes . here , the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains , which provide for plenty of beautiful picture postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture . but while we indulge in wistful scenery , the characters don not get to establish that level of trust from the onset , and we have to wait a few seasons to past , and 45 minutes into the film , before they find a leveler in food . the child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement , but the fox , well , as other notions of course . while i thought the narrative was pretty weak , unlike march of the penguins which has that human narrative interpretation of what's happening on screen , what excelled here were the documentary elements of the movie , tracing the life and times of the fox as both a predator , and a prey . between the two , more tension and drama was given to the latter , especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves , and granted , those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it . otherwise , it was plain sailing and quite a bore as the two of them go about their playing with each other , in shots that you know have undergone some movie magic editing . there were surprisingly dark moments in the movie that weren not really quite suitable for children , as those in the same hall attested to it by bawling their eyes out suddenly , so parents , you might want to take note and not let your toddler disturb the rest of the movie goers . as a film , i would have preferred this to be a complete documentary ala the march of the penguins , but i guess the way it was resented , probably had the objective of warning us not to meddle with nature , and that some things are just not meant to be , and should stay as such . decent movie that leaned on the strength of the chemistry between bertille noel bruneau , and the multiple foxes that played rena rd

2			budget	low	access	easy	galleries	various	pieces	various	air	predictable	pieces	enthusiastic	ratio	original	feature	special			as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves , we perhaps shouldn not expect too much from broken in disc form . and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation . with regards to the latter , the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non anamorphic transfer . otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85 1 ratio , demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected . indeed , given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact . the same is also true of the soundtrack . here we are offered both dd 2.0 and dd 5.1 mixes and whilst i m uncertain as to which should be deemed the original , the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior . indeed , though the dd 5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilizes the score , both are equally fine and free of technical flaws . as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them . take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you will notice numerous commentaries , loads of featurettes and various galleries . indeed , given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary , there really is little to discuss . the anatomy of a stunt featurette , for example , is exactly what it claims to be , and the same goes for the rest of pieces . as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre production , production and post production . and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall making of , in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view . of the various pieces , then , it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion . then again , there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks . the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn not take the film too seriously . ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing . and the technical ones are , well , extremely technical . of course , we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs , but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome . indeed , all in all , a fine extras package .
2			it	adorable	movie	worth	library	local	it	fun			first off , let me say i have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because i knew angelina jolie was in it and i love her . but my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie . anyhow , no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did . i watched it and absolutely loved it . yes there were italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny . it was not degrading in any way . every actor and actress did a superb job . i laughed very hard at the sexual humor . overall , i think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it . it is adorable and just plain fun to watch . i rarely rank movies as a 10 but i give this one a 10 ! go find it and watch it !
2			tenant	previous	them	frightening	films	attractive	movies	best	one	easy no	layers	due	realm	different	man	young	movies	low	them	attractive	characters	memorable	seems	wooden	directors	important	nature	personal	he	capable	horror	psychological	characters	important	works	best	lines	pleased	it	empty			roman polanski is considered as one of the most important directors of our time , as the mind behind classics such as rosemary's baby and chinatown . probably what makes polanski's cinema a very interesting one is the fact that while he is capable of creating commercially attractive films such as the afore mentioned masterpieces , he is also fond of making low key movies that are of a more personal nature . le locataire , or the tenant , is one of those movies ; a horror / suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done . polanski himself plays telkovsky , a young man looking for an apartment in france . when he finally finds one , he discovers that it is empty because the previous tenant , simone choule , attempted to kill herself by jumping out of the window . after simone dies of the injuries , trelkovsky begins to become obsessed with her , to the point of believing that her death was caused by the rest of the tenants in the building . while sharing the same claustrophobic feeling of his other apartment themed films repulsion & rosemary's baby ; this film focuses on the bizarre conspiracy that may or may not be entirely in trelkovsky's head , the catastrophic effects the paranoia has on his mind , and the bizarre obsession he has with the previous tenant . trelkovsky's descend into darkness is portrayed perfectly by polanski . while at first his performance seems odd and wooden , slowly one finds out that polanski acts that way because trelkovsky is meant to be acted that way ; as a simpleton with almost no life , who traps himself in this maddening sub world that happens to be inhabited by a collection of bizarre people . the supporting actors really gave life to the people in the building creating memorable characters that are very important for the success of the film . also , the beautiful cinematography polanski employs in the film helps to increase the feeling of isolation , and gives life to the beautiful building that serves as cage for trelkovsky . the haunting images polanski uses to convey the feeling of confusion and madness are of a supernatural beauty that makes them both frightening and attractive . if a flaw is to be found in the film , is that it is definitely a bit slow at fir st this may sound like a turn off but in fact the slow pace of the beginning works perfectly as it mimics trelkovsky's own boring life and how gradually he enters a different realm . also , the convoluted storyline is definitely not an easy one to understand due to the many complex layers it has . however , more than a flaw , it is a joy to face a thought provoking plot like this one . while the tenant may not be for everyone , those interested in psychological horror and surreal story lines will be pleased by the experience . le locataire is really one of roman polanksi's masterpieces . 10 10
2			aunt	great	role	finest	seems	illogical	laugh	tragic	effort	laughable			again , it seems totally illogical , to me at least , that arthur merits a mere 6.4 out of 10 possible . steve gordon's one shot masterpiece herein is the totally unlikely if not quite impossible melding of wildly disparate elements . that he managed to make alcoholism laugh friendly rather than tearjerking tragic is , in itself , wonderful . that he gave dudley moore his finest role , and every other cinematic element herein its optimal impact , including the score , seems to me patent and egregious . i challenge anyone to sit through this film and not laugh out loud . but , apparently , nearly a third of its audience has so managed . well , i , for one , found and find gordon's effort both laughable and lovable , and the iikes of geraldine fitzgerald's great aunt and stephen elliott's murderous would be father in law absolute gems of background characters . even the black chauffeur managed to escape patronization , and the late , sniffish sir john gielgud was right about accepting his fee , but wrong about undertaking his role . arthur makes no effort to underztand , much less rationalize , the scourge of alcoholism hey , ifit ain not booze , it's other drugs of choice , including meth , and addictions are merely symptoms , not targets , it simply observes in its own quizzical manner .

2			film	great			atlantis was much better than i had anticipated . in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age . although this film did demand a soid attention span at times . it was a great film for all ages . i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure . i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies . a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies . after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis .
2			it	subtle	it	good	attachment	emotional	profession	true	man	good	campbell	young			writer / director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film , panic , from the year 2000 and that includes his choice of cast william macy , tracy ullman , john ritter , neve campbell , donald sutherland , barbara bain , david dorfman . brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un funny roles , and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see . panic is the story of a hit man , alex macy who actually works for his father sutherland . he covers his true profession by doing mail order work ; by all appearances , he and his wife ullman and their son sammy dorfman are a typical suburban family . unhappy with his life , alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist ritter , telling only his mother bain . in the waiting room , he meets a young woman campbell to whom he is immediately attracted , which complicates his situation further . his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatri st when alex receives his next assignment , he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatri st this is a profound story of a gentle , good man made into a killer by a monster of a father , with his mother's knowledge , who kills to please his father but also can not stand up to him and quit . his rage is so deep seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression . when it's time for panic to moves , it does quickly . panic doesn not seem panicked at all . in fact , it moves very slowly . but it moves slowly not because it's poorly made the slowness is deliberate , mirroring alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog . by making a decision about sara , the campbell character , and by seeing his mark , his own psychiatrist , as a living , breathing human being , alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is and how they don not jive . and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche , sammy's . william macy gives another brilliant performance , as a loving father , a distant husband , and a cold killer , the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires , a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated . this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater . it's too adult , too small , too subtle , too character driven , and too good .
2			force	powerful	footing	equal	it	true	children	young	population	entire	life	real	priest	local	leaders	religious	family	real	performance	powerful	trauma	emotional	farmer	local	portrait	realistic no	note	special			i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion , and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect . a love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine . at the beginning of the film , we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children . sean is catholic and sheila is protestant , but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic . there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village . the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school . the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this sin and soon has sheila's husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father , the local dairy farmer . in an act of defiance and desperation , sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area . special note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila . she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment . on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community . if fiction , this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama . considering it is true , it changes to a horrific tragedy . in real life , the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there . it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events , and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area , they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers . whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice , crashing planes into buildings , subjugating women , condemning whole races , or just plain on torture and murder , we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society .

2			timing	comic	it	easy			neil simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives walter matthau and jack lemmon as opposite types in the odd couple a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment . lemmon is neatnik felix ungar , bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with oscar madison matthau with somewhat disastrous results . seems that everything felix says and does drives oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other's ways , with oscar being the messiest male imaginable and felix the exact opposite . funniest scene for me was when the giggling pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date . the priceless interaction between lemmon , matthau and carole shelley and monica evans is enough to put you in stitches . the talented pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the gabble sisters a pair of geese in disney's the aristocats , and here their comic timing on top of lemmon's sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time . if you are a neil simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work , this one is not to be missed . matthau and lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and , of course , it's easy to see why it became a top rated tv show later on . summing up top simon comedy , not to be missed .

europa is often criticized for weighing advanced technique such as multi layered background projection above plot and characters , but hey that's what reviewers criticized stanley kubrick's 1968 visual masterpiece 2001 a space odyssey for nowadays it holds an obligatory place in all cinema history books . europa also gets accused of historical incorrectness . apparently trier assigns the nazis werewolf terrorist group too much historical significance . according to various online sources that's correct a fascinating subject try googl ing it yourself ! yet trier's purposes are neither educational nor portraying history accurately . europa is a never ending nightmare . leopold kessler is hypnotized , therefore the universe that the audience encounters is a distorted reality . equally it shows how our memory deceives us a 100 accurate reconstruction is a lie ! although young audiences who experience europa are too young to have memories from wwii , we have a collective memory of it from various bbc documentaries , so these small inaccuracies actually serve a purpose they inform us us that we are not in post wwii germany 1945 but in leopolds memory of it . all three europa trilogy chapters portray young ideologists with noble intentions forced into corruption and losing their ideological innocence . the ambiguous endings of forbrydelsens element and europa show the ideologists getting forever caught in their hypnotized realities . before , during and after shooting europa in 1990 in poland , lars von trier and co writer niels vrsel were extremely interested in wwii . it shows . it's packed with extremely beautiful shots catching the atmosphere of the time period spot on . a great example is the old polish church europa was shot in poland primarily for economic reasons in the last act of europa . as with 2001 space odyssey i think europa will receive it's rightfully deserved place in cinema history . its method of twisting old film noir love affair clichs and visual techniques is so unique , strange and completely different from anything you will see from hollywood nowadays , or any other dream factory for that matter . europa is an essential movie in the lars von trier catalog . some write it off as pure commercial speculation , but that would be catastrophic . it's right up there with other trier classics and semi classics such as forbrydelsens element from 1984 the tv series riget from 1993 and dogville from 2003 it's a unique experience from before trier cared for his actors , and before the dogme 95 manifesto . watch it !

2			brilliance	true	guys	good	it	violent	guys	bad	detour	little	fan	big	picture	great	you	surprised	they	great	i	thrilled			my mother and i were on our way home from a trip up to the north east mainly massachusetts when we decided to take a little detour a attend a film festival in boston . now , i don not know much about film so i thought this might be a bit educational . the first movie we saw was this one , the romeo division . now , i don not know about you but i thought this was great ! i m from texas and where i come from we don not see too many motion pictures so this was a pleasant surprise . my mother insisted that it was too violent , but said that i didn not know much about what she was saying but this was a great picture . i was shocked by the fight sequences they were great . also , i am a big fan when the good guys win so i was thrilled when romeo ladies killed all of the bad guys . this was true brilliance . i m not sure when it's getting released on video but if you get the chance you should check it out . i think you will be pleasantly surprised . a word to the wise though , it is rather violent and there many cuss words so you may not want to let your children watch . it's more for adults .
2			films	best			what is so taboo about love ? people seem to have major problems with the transgenered . the title of this movie didn not catch my eye . it was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing . i could not believe how freaking amazing this film was . it touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way . it is by far one of the best independent films i have ever seen . i did not view these characters as either gender , just human . i would recommend it to anyone who loves movies . especially independent fil ms praise to all fearless filmmakers !
2			ingénue	young	accent	heavy	quirks	directorial	actress	former	ideas	original	holidays	safe	it	serious	heist	classical		old	tower	modern	version	french	patience	little	wardrobe	good	amount	considerable	car	modern	bronson	classical	connection	french	undertow	strong			short synopsis this film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men . one of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses . later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the christmas holidays . hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids , so it is really serious . with exposed , well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women . one gets caught , the other remains free and is not given away by his companion . a last encounter , a last light for a cigarette , adieu l ami , farewell , friend . i found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters , played by classical he man superstars alain delon and charles bronson . they are obviously attracted to each other , their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout . the whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow , a little like deliverance . it is also very stylish . the safe the two men want to crack is in a for the time ultra modern glass and aluminum tower . it is the seat of a publicity firm , so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around . the wardrobe is also very good . the ultra stylish citroen ds maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie perhaps a subtle kind of product placement . i can recommend this movie for the actor's performances alone . delon and bronson are really sharing the top billing , in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting . both do a considerable amount of acrobatics . i have never seen bronson better than here , he really acts and speaks french throughout , with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed . and it is certainly the man himself we hear . so the french language version is highly recommended . the police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite franch character actors , bernard fresson who was gene hackman's partner in french connection ii . he is the best brainy police inspector i know . also very good is former child actress brigitte fossey as the young ingnue who , as it turns out , is not so innocent as it first see ms anyone who expects the old in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film . for those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience , full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks , although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake .
2			costumes	great	movies	little			beautifully made with a wonderful performance from gretchen moll capturing such a stainless plain happiness in her work , and the recreations of the little movies and the photographs are perfectly made and often hilarious . according to harron they used film stock that is no longer produced and fifties style studio lighting even for the outside locations to give the colour portions its distinctive look . bettie page saw the movie at hugh heffner's house she is now eighty three with the producers there , but not the director , in case it got awkward if she didn not like it . she apparently did like it up until the official inquiry , which she found unsettling . some great costumes too . the idea for the movie started in 1993 but this was worth the wait . the portrait of her never seems to ring false in reference to all those images and snippets of dreadful movies that many of us will have already seen . it would make an interesting companion piece with goodnight and goodluck , but much more pleasant viewing !
2			tears	real	show	strong	show	best	show	great	improvement	best	comedy	great			this show was great , it wasn not just for kids which i thought at first , it is for the whole family . the first season was mostly about the father looking after is two daughters and son , he sadly passed away in season 2 i could believe it when i heard it . i am clad they carried on with the show as that what would really happen in really life and i need to mention the goodbye episode it was so well made , it must of be so hard for them to film this , you could tell they were real tears in theirs eyes . i am 24 year old male and this episode did make me cry me as i know how they felt as my father died when i was 13 years too just like roy . season 2 and season 3 had great comedy in there also season 3 had some of my favorites such freaky friday , secrets . i still think the show was strong enough to go on , i was disappointed that it ended , it was one the best no it was the best family comedy show ever since home improvement and it could have been the next friends . it should never have ended but still love watching the repeats everyday .
2			reputation	greatest	camp	perfect	i	glad	apple	big	it	terrific	apple	bad			i am glad other people enjoyed this movie , cause i know it doesn not have the greatest reputation and it made no money at the box office . i thought it was terrific and there are several reasons why bogdanovich directs with the lightest of touches , the cast especially coleen camp is perfect and the big bad apple never looked better on film . you have seen worse movies !
2			disaster	financial	kershaw	essential	stance	theatrical			even though ian kershaw distanced himself from this project due to inaccuracies in regards to hitler's life and yes , this is dramatised , but essential . robert carlyle plays hitler during his later years , during this documentary that only deals with hitler from boyhood until he became chancellor of germany , including the night of the long knives . this tv film also a two part mini series shows how a series of factors allowed hitler to come to power , for example the financial disaster of 1930 the series follows hitler and little else , apart from the lives of fritz gerlich and ernst hanfstaengl . all in all , valuable and filled with interesting actors , yet i feel it should have been more tightly directed with stronger cinematography ; most actors are portrayed in half body shots which for me makes for a theatrical stance , not cinematic . the tempo is at times drowsy , and the film does suffer from it , being approximately 2 5 hours long .
2			twists	enjoyable	giallo	enjoyable			a fine martino outing , this is a spirited and enjoyable giallo with fine performances from good looking cast and principally the two leads , george hilton and anita strindberg . for me the jig saw puzzle of a plot is so convoluted and confusing you just sit back and enjoy rather than try to anticipate . just when all seems resolved we are again taken on a further series of twists , enjoyable twists , it has to be said . sexy with plenty of gory kills this a well paced movie with london , athens and greek coastal locations . a super finale set upon aegean rocks wraps things up and much fun was had by all .
2			awareness	constant	culture	new	day	current	island	gorgeous	ceylon	british	girl	young	lanka	classic			the scintillating elizabeth taylor stars in this lesser known classic as a young girl from london who falls in love with a tea plantation owner from british ceylon current day sri lanka . upon arrival she instantly feels out of place and is forced to adapt to the new culture as well as be in constant awareness of the angry elephant he rd william dieterle , who also directed the life of emile zola and portrait of jennie , does a masterful job of bringing a somewhat dark , and almost eerie , undertone to this romance and the setting is one of the most beautiful i have seen with the black and white themed mansion and the gorgeous island scenery .
2			actors	real	cowboy	urban	i	sorry	movie	entire			i did not see this film in the theater . i confess to an anti vinnie barbarino bias . who the hell was john travolta to be making movies ? i remember the oscar broadcast that year , with travolta looking absolutely devastated when he didn not win . how dare he , when there were real actors in the running ? i m sorry john , you should have won . after catching this film on cable years ago , i fell in love with the entire movie . bud , sissy , uncle bob , wes , all wonderfully done . i , also , confess to never passing it by when i channel surf . i have to stop and watch . over the years , i have learned to do most of the dialogue , dance with my thumbs in my waistband , and learned to appreciate travolta more . the only disappointing thing to me was the oversight , on the soundtrack , of some of the music from urban cowboy . looking for love defines the film , but urban cowboy was chock full of classics that didn not make it to the soundtrack . it should have been a double cd . .
2			choice	great	series	best			i think this has the potential of being the best star trek series yet , i say potential . we all know there is a chance they will drop the ball and run out of ideas . but i hope not ! for those that have not seen it ! without that annoying prime directive floating over their heads every time they encounter races it could be cool . and scott bakula was without a doubt a great choice for captain , and the vulcan babe is hot too , check out the decontamination scene i gave this a full 10 . it blows away all the other series openers . i hope this goes longer than 7 years .
2			characters	real	man	old	moments	scary	film	good	job	great			probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet . not surprising , since king himself wrote the screenplay . the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house . one of the other residents is jud , a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area . one is the highway that runs right through their frontya rd the other is a path leading to the pet sematary , where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway . soon enough , ellie creed's cat , church , is found dead . luckily , this happens while the family , with the exception of louis the father , is away for thanksgiving . jud takes louis to another burial ground , beyond the pet sematary , where church is to be buried . later , louis is greeted not so politely by church . he's returned , appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in . maybe he was buried alive . maybe not . nothing more i can say without ruining the story . of all the king adaptions i have seen this would be the most terrifying . the characters are real and the situations are normal . mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings . suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film , due in part to the plot development . the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever . then , of course , we have the conclusion . easy to determine what's going to happen , but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary , and sometimes disturbing , moments . overall , this is a good film and an excellent adaption . if you enjoy being scared and don not mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then pet sematary is just what you are looking for . non horror fans will want to avoid this .
2			pity	greatest	approach	different	take	positive	film	fantastic	bravery	great	actors	professional	women	young	conspiracy	global	maker	successful	fact	amazing	storyline	heavy	looks	fantastic			another fantastic film from a country , where due to decades of oppression from fundamentalist regimes , has no problems in creating passionate subject matter . panahi takes a different approach this time around with a blend of ironic comedy and an endearing , non professional ca st while still getting across his message of what he sees as being inherently wrong with his country , he does so without the need of a heavy storyline . it is a positive take on a country , in particular its people , that the iranian population desperately need . the greatest pity is it won not be released domestically . the insular , paranoid iranian government assert that this fine film maker is only successful overseas because he is part of a global conspiracy to embarrass them . after growing up amid revolution and watching the academics , artists and educated would isappear over the last 25 years he shows great bravery in continuing to put his work out there . the realism achieved by shooting at the actual world cup qualifier really transports you to the event . the fact he shot it on 35 m is amazing as most would only attempt this project using a digital format . it looks fantastic . his insistence in only using non professional actors also really works in this film . fine performances all round . after watching many films showing the problems iran has and also the news media reporting the facts we can tend to demonise the people as well as the government . this film does the opposite . it shows us they still love the same things and that by laughing at themselves and the absurd rules of sharia law that maybe a change for the better isn not too far away . some call panahi a feminist film maker but i think he just fights for the most oppressed demographic in iran . young , independent women .
2			acting	superb			i felt drawn into the world of the manipulation of mind and will at the heart of the story . the acting by nolte , lee , arkin and the supporting cast was superb . the strange twists in the vonnegut story are made stranger by odd details .
2			you	deep	effects	special	budget	low	boogeyman	best	curtis	new	he	terrifying			halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep ! it is in my opinion , the scariest movie of all time . michael myers is the best boogeyman ever ! he was just so terrifying ! what makes halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is , this was on a low budget and had a one note score , yet managed to scare the hell out of people . 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in 78 it's about a boy michael myers , he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution . dr sam loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back , since he describes michael as evil . the blackest eyes , the devil's eyes . michael is on a mission though , to kill his other sister , laurie , played by a new jamie lee curtis . she has to babysit on halloween , while her friends are out partying and of course , we know the rules , they get it ! but laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin . d halloween pays many homages to psycho , we have another character named sam loomis and jamie lee curis , the daughter of janet leigh . halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors , bolt your windows , and turn off the lights ! they are gonna get you ! they are gonna get you ! halloween , the ultimate horror film ! 10 10
2			out	essential	asset	important	characters	respectable	argument	honest	audience	awake	scenes	present	sequence	delicious			this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind . the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen . it treats themes like duty , guilt , word , manipulation and trust like few films have done and , unfortunately , none that i can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies . the sequence is delicious , down to the essential , living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake . no such scenes are present or needed . the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator , wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience . no , this is not miss marble . a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute , not just to see .
2			stories	great	language	awesome	thing	good	language	difficult	movie	greatest	screen	big	movie	beautiful	movies	powerful			there were a lot of things going against this movie for me before i watched it . first , i was a typical high school senior , in a shakespeare class i didn not really even like , much less understood half of ! shakespeare would be no more than unintelligible without me pouring all my concentration into his almost encrypted plays . encrypted with his extremely difficult to understand language . and then i still wouldn not get most of it . second , it was 4 hours long ! i never thought that could be a good thing . well let me tell you something . this movie was so masterful , so beautiful , i actually understood all the language as it was being performed . now , the script was followed to the letter in this movie , the same script that was incomprehensible to me in shakespeare class . and here i was my mind opening and me understanding it . i was doubting myself while watching the movie almost ! but lo and behold . when performed , and only then , shakespeare comes to life . so this version of hamlet showed me that shakespeare is indeed a master , who wrote great stories . when i saw it on the big screen , especially in the high budget major motion picture style with beautiful cinematography and photography , and acted amazingly by brannagh and cast , somehow . i understood what was going on . what was being said . the language is awesome and passionate . it allows for more raw emotion . when words can not describe something , maybe shakespeare's words can . i still hold to this day that fist of the north star animated , english dub is the greatest movie ever made . no movie provides more sheer entertainment . but for a movie to come close to dethroning fist from that position which hamlet did it came close is truly amazing . awe inspiring . it wasn not a movie . it was an event . even more amazing , it made me appreciate shakespeare . wow . powerful . powerful is the wo rd one of the rare , truly powerful movies out there . this gets 2 hundred trillion stars out of infinity stars . yes yes . by the way , all you kids out there in a shakespeare class . forget it . you are wasting you are time . you have to see the plays performed . only then will justice be done to them .
2			westerns	greatest	lawgiver	remarkable	films	greatest	lincoln	young	historians	great	costs	social	war	civil	city	new	america	young	war	revolutionary	howlers	historical			in his otherwise excellent book , lincoln in american memory , the historian merrill peterson calls young mr lincoln a boring , dreadful , film . this amazingly wrongheaded analysis simply proves that great historians are rarely fine film critics . i am working on a doctoral dissertation on abraham lincoln and frederick douglass . as part of my preparation for writing the dissertation , i made a careful analysis of this film , and of tag gallaghers brilliant interpretation of it in his seminal book on fo rd young mr lincoln comes out that culminating year of the first phase of ford's cinematic authorship , that greatest of hollywood years , ford directed three superb , still not fully appreciated films drums along the mohawk , stagecoach , and young mr lincoln . it might seem odd to say that stagecoach is not fully appreciated , all but the most purblind of critics must perceive that it is one of of the greatest westerns , and perhaps even one of the hundred greatest films of all time . however , what is not fully appreciated is that these three films work together as a kind of trilogy a triptych , in fact . ford is creating a sort of mythic history of america on screen . drums along the mohawk is the revolutionary war . young mr lincoln is pre civil war america . finally , stagecoach is post civil war america . what the three films have in common is that they are an extended meditation on the american adam and his errand into the wilderness . what are the psychic and social costs of american manifest destiny , as america strives to build a new human city in the wilderness ? lincoln symbolizes americas journey , as he seeks to reconcile the civilizational inmpulse law , with the freedom of the wilderness . young mr lincoln is not history , it is full of historical howlers as both ford and trotti were well aware , but myth . this is lincoln , the symbol of justice and mercy , lincoln , the man of the wilderness , striving to found a civilization within himself , and to become the remarkable lawgiver of young america . young mr lincoln is not history like james agee's long forgotten teleplay about lincoln , and like sandburgs biography , it is an epic poem . a very beautiful epic poem .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			for a no budget movie this thing rocks . i don not know if america's gonna like it , but we were laughing all the way through . some really funny funny stuff . really non hollywood . the actors and music rocked . the cars and gags and even the less in your face stuff cracked us up . whooo whooo ! i have seen some of the actors before , but never in anything like this , one or two of them i think i have seen in commercials or in something somewhere . basically it rocked ! luckily i got to see a copy from a friend of one of the actors .
2			peepers	charming	quality	good	it	old	ones	fun	comedy	quiet			i have just finished viewing the 1 t disc in a 4 disc 26 episodes collection created in conjunction with the ucla film & television archive s more entertainment , incorporation . so far aside from the 1 t episode , the image quality is quite good . the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb . mr peepers is just as charming as when i first saw it 5 years old at the time and wally cox is truly endearing in this role . if you are in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you , as opposed to hitting you over the head , you will treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood . although some of the gags are a bit corny , most are ingenious and even the corny ones are fun . this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it .
2			quotes	humorous	quotes	memorable			i thought that baseketball was one of the most funniest films i have ever seen ! it's witty humour made me giggle all the way through , and the fact that trey and matt are so over the top , boosts the film's comedy . i have just bought baseketball on dvd and its just one of those movies where you would never get tired of watching it . i have a very short attention span and i think this film has so any funny bits that it keeps me entertained throughout . the humorous quotes are memorable , and can make me laugh for hours if i remember them later . so overall i think that baseketball is brilliant movie which everyone should go see , especially if you are younger like me as it will keep you laughing for a long time afterwards . p . s does anybody think its weird for me to like them both ? hehe
2			character	beautiful no	gripe	real			one night i stumbled upon this on the satellite station bravo . initially out of curiosity i decided to watch be perfectly honest i wasn not main character is beautiful and her body is shown off would think her talents would be wasted as a executioner but apparently not after watching the whole film ! my only real gripe is the acting of the supporting cast particularly the actor who plays melnik . christ its bad ! the prison guard hank is woeful he ever does is get drunk and make ill attempted passes at his co guard wanda though fortunately for us the viewer and for hank he gets down and dirty with wanda near the end . the music used is pretty tense and creates the perfect atmosphere for the executions . this movie is well watching alone for the beautiful , talented and very sexy jennifer thomas

2			father	abusive	son	youngest	lives	entire	pressure	unbearable	parallel	real	sons	young	clues	strong	adam	comfortable no	family	entire	structure	similar	fenton	horrified	pressure	tragic			frailty is a non gory horror film that achieves its chills by following the logic and impact of a man's delusion / obsession straight into depravity . dad we never learn his name is a gentle man and loving father who's raising his sons alone after mom died giving birth to the youngest son , adam . the family's world flips upside down late one night when dad rushes into the boys room and tells them god has given him a vision . and what a vision the entire family's job is to destroy demons , who , of course , are disguised in human form . proceeding from this premise , the movie is unflinching in following it . dad kidnaps people / demons whom god has told him to destroy , binds them , lays his hand on them to see a vision of their evil , then kills them while making his young sons watch . fenton , the older boy , is horrified , seeing only a father who's turned into a crazed murderer . adam , the younger , is uncomfortable , but trusts that dad is following god's will . eventually , dad takes his sons on missions to abduct the demons that god has put on dad's list , and finally , invites them to fully participate in god's mission for the family . this is not , you understand , an abusive father . he loves his children . he is only following god's instructions this is our job now , son . we have got to do this . when fenton , terrified and convinced his father has gone mad , says he will report him to the police , his father explains , if you do that , son , i will die . the angel was clear on this . the pressure that the children are under is unbearable and tragic , and warps their entire lives . 1 the movie's structure is similar to the one used in the usual suspects a story in flashback , told in a police station to a fbi agent . the moody lighting , the stormy weather , and the eerie calm in the present day add to the menace of the backstory . i wanted to believe the unfolding horror was just a story , until i remembered the real life parallel of andrea yates , who believed she was possessed by satan and could save her children by drowning them . even then , i wanted to believe that i was watching a human tragedy , rather than a story of divine retribution . the movie gave me no such comfort , though , as it gave strong clues at the end about the veracity of dad's vision . and this , as much as some plot holes , posed a problem for me . regardless of the accuracy of dad's visions , regardless of the evil that his victims may have committed , where does anyone derive the authority to act as an angel of death ? 1 roger ebert review , 4 12 02

2			ladies	young	it	silly	color	different	prison	local	flick	little	it	fun	it	stupid no			this is an interesting little flick made in 1967 with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you , it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun . i saw many similarities between this and creature with the blue hand aka the bloody dead and they do have the same director ! scotland yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college . seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done . there's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid , and there's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine , it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire . joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance . there's a monk , and how anyone identifies this thing as a monk is beyond me , it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood , more of a klan member of a different color than a monk . there's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk , and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight , a nifty trick right there . this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones , and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch . 7 out of 10 not bad .
2			images	pleasant no	history	theatrical	terms	realistic	it	hard	impression	strong	film	hard	war	modern	relief	comic	cliché	flat			it's hard for me to assign the fair number of stars to this film , but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was , in 1968 an innovative approach to the war film . remember too that i haven not seen it since 1969 but it did make a strong impression . the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made . it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944 -45 no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail , and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves . there is no preaching , no sentimentality , no comic relief , no complicated scenarios . unfortunately , there's no subtlety either . partly because of their situation trying to stay alive the characters come across as flat , familiar clich's . as entertainment , the film doesn not make it , though it was clearly not intended to entertain . it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general . this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan , both of which are far more watchable fil ms here the flat and generally disagreeable characters , the lack of an actual plot , and the realistically unpleasant images including what may be the first on screen vomit in theatrical history make the film hard to sit through , though it is only 95 minutes . so , 10 stars for production and realism , 4 stars for the feeling you will have when it's over , a bonus star for having its heart in the right place . average 8 like carl foreman's underrated the victors , an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought provoking film , the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd . why not ? both films have been on cable a number of times .
2			it	fortunate no	jobs	horrible	ass	serious	lords	local			anyone who had never seen anything like the fight scenes in the matrix has never seen this movie . the fight scenes were choreographed by action scene psychopath yuen woo ping , who also did the fights in the matrix . and the fight scenes are somethin . li plays a supersoldier who feels no pain , who now lives a life as a pacifist librarian ya got me . when other evil supersoldiers begin killing off local drug lords to take over the drug trade , li teams up with his cop buddy to help stop them . there are some absolutely crazy things going on in this movie one badguy gets his arm lopped off with a pane of glass and hardly notices . the fights scenes are filled with flying kicks and punches ; the body count is way up there . li has seldom been better , and he has surrounded himself with a bevy of beautiful female costars yip kicks some serious ass as a fellow supersoldier . anthony wong even makes a cameo as a drug lord no suprises there ; he makes a cameo in every hk movie . it's unfortunate they don not make action movies like this in the us ; i wouldn not have to sit through all of these horrible dubbing jobs to see that action that i crave so much . recommended .

's portrayal in the 1970 s tv series starring pamela sue martin as nancy drew , in which ned was a gawky , awkward kid with a little crush on nancy . the character of corky josh flitty , a twelve year old with a crush on nancy , is much less annoying than max thierot's ned . amy bruckner and kay panabaker seem appropriately cast as nancy's gal pals bess and george , but they only make brief cameos at the beginning of the film . speaking of cameos , chris kattan snl , eddie jemison ocean's 13 , and bruce willis all make surprise guest appearances , which just proves you never can guess which movie bruce willis will pop up in next . the movie does fail to live up to some potential . it's mentioned early on that the drews new house is heavily booby trapped , but nancy and her father are done with tripping over booby traps a few minutes after that . also , nancy describes the cold case she's about to investigate as a murder taking place at an extravagant party , which should yield plenty of potential murderers , but she only encounter a handful of suspects . and while there's some moments of real suspense during nancy's adventures , the solution to the case comes out of nowhere , and in the end all possible plot threads are tied up too conveniently and who cares who done it . ralph sall's score adds to the movie's suspense , but the contemporary teenybopper songs woven into the soundtrack are lame . still , i really enjoyed this film , and while the movie is aimed primarily at tween girls , people of any age and gender can enjoy it .

2			battle	climatic	entanglement	romantic	adaptation	classic	feel	present	payoff	big	views	political	troopers	classic			robert heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years , in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series , to a number of games . but none of these , so to speak , has really captured the spirit of his novel . the games are usually unrelated , the tv series was more of a spin off , and the less said about verhoeven's film , the better . little do most know , however , that in japan , an animated adaptation had already been done , released the year of heinlein's death . and , believe it or not , despite its differences , this 6 part animated series is , plot wise , the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic . the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons , something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film . like the book , the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel , though we see a fair amount of each . while events happen differently than in the book , the feel of the book's plot is present . rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement , but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book . while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book it gets a bit of the anime treatment , but what did you expect ? but it's far superior to the film . heinlein's political views are merely excised , as opposed to the film , where they are reversed . the big payoff of the series , however , is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs / aliens , which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version . overall , i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein . and i think they did pretty well with this . if you can find this series , give it a look .
2			movies	great	york	new	hits	greatest	china	little	trouble	big			i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland , it all came flooding back . why this hasn not had a video or dvd release yet ? it's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been . in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn not been released . in fact i haven not seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it . kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis . this is definitely a role he was born to play . john carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i would love the tv to play again . it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes . belting out most of elvis's greatest hits with gusto . i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies escape from new york , the thing , big trouble in little china , and escape from l . a . someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life , which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has . if this doesn not get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel .
2			score	orchestral	music	ok	it	comfortable no	mix	big	script	fantastic			i liked it ! the plot was weird , drew barrymore and dc making out was awkward for both of them . drews acting was dodgy in places but this could be down to her life at the time . dennis christopher as the shrink was pretty cool , and as always he does his best i m a major dennis fan anyway , that's why i bought the dvd . i didn not get the ending ! that weird animatronic red skeleton thing looked just like it was out of filmschool , which is ok i guess but it could have been more . the whole thing with the knife if it was that uncomfortable why didn not they just get rid of it ? it was very confusing as to when it was the doppelganger weird thing or when it was dc or was it dennis all the time ? because the doppelganger made out with dennis and patrick . in the scenes with patrick if it was dennis as the doppelganger then i think patrick would notice . the music was ok but obtrusive in places , the whole orchestral score seemed to be revolving around a theme but this theme was overdone . a big mix of lots of blood and gratuitus shots of drew nude . all in all a bit of a gpm guilty pleasure movie . don not read too much into it , don not look for secret messages and a fantastic script because you wont find it . there are some diamond moments and goofs galore watch it and just have a bit of fun with it !
2			ground	familiar	cast	great	aniston	charming			fairly funny jim carrey vehicle that has him as a news reporter who temporarily gets the power of god and wrecks havoc . carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time , and jennifer aniston as his put upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting . the story is predictible to the extreme but the cast including morgan freeman as god is great and makes the film worth catching . grade b

2			world	unforgettable	people	young			this should be required viewing for all young people . this is documentary at its best , from the haunting music and terrific narration by olivier to its unflinching and penetrating analyses , the world at war is unforgettable and irreplaceable for anyone who wants to know about humanity's sorry experience at the nadir of the 20 h century .
2			performance	best	guys	bad	travis	good	lee	best	job	great	he	bad no			action , horror , sci fi , exploitation director fred olen ray shows he has some talent as a director . character actor william smith is one of the best tough / bad guys in the industry . he treats the viewer with the best acting performance of his career . as for randy travis he gives his best lee van cleef impression . he's not bad in the film . smith and travis make the movie . as for the rest of the cast none of them really stand out . ray did a great job directing this flick , smith and travis were good , i would give this b western on a scale of one to ten ten being the best a seven .
2			peter	outstanding	trip	classic			i saw the film at the nashville film festival . it was beautifully done , from cinematography to the acting . it's the story of a father and son , and how they come to appreciate each other during a family crisis . beautifully written with dialog that never rings false , the film showcases the acting talents of paul reiser and peter falk , among others in this outstanding ca st the film begins with the aging father peter falk is trying to figure out why his wife olympia dukakis has left him . the father presents himself , unannounced , on the doorstep of his son and daughter in law . the father and son take off the next day to look at some property and end up taking a classic road trip . they fish , play pool , watch a baseball game , get drunk , get involved in a barroom brawl , and dance with strange women . but more important , they each confront the unspoken tensions that can affect any family . it's the kind of film that touches the heart and makes one appreciate those who are closest to them .
2			quinn	adorable	scene	poignant	harris	talented	it	painful	he	alive	harris	believable			i absolutely loved this film ! i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful . i remember how hard it was when john was shot . however , watching the two of us took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility . i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what might have been . aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on . i was impressed with his accent and manneris ms jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john . my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene which was so poignant . the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction , both of which i feel are appropriate , given the circumstances .
2			face	new	blend	good	rest	entertaining	it	good	rest	clean	story	good	lady	young	bit	little	emma	fun	film	good	rest	fun	film	rare	i	surprised			i really enjoyed this movie . most of the reviews have been bad , but most critics think a movie should be like an idea drama . this movie has a little bit of drama , but the rest is just clean fun and very entertaining . forget about julia roberts being a pretty woman , emma roberts is a beautiful young lady and there is more to her than just that . emma was so much fun to watch in the role of nancy drew . it is good to see a new face . i believe she will go far . nancy drew may not be based upon the books , but the story is still good . there is also a good blend of other character actors and supporting actors like pat carroll , barry bostwick , rachel leigh cook and chris kattan not credited . i m surprised disney did not release this movie . some people may not like this movie because it does not contain sex , violence , and cursing . this is a good family film which is rare in this day in time . so take your family , see this movie and judge for your self how good it is . i can not wait for the sequel .
2			counterparts	good	slice	real	i	glad	job	nice			though cher and cage are the focal points of this story , gardenia and dukakis are good counterparts for them this is where loretta and ronny will be in 50 years still in love . the whole cast does a nice job from aiello to john mahoney it shows a real slice of life . though i saw this long ago i am glad it finally catapulted cage to the place where he was recognized in hollywood for his talent . from the music to the scenes at the opera to the kitchen table arguments this is a very entertaining movie .
2			movie	best	story	original	heroes	true			by hook or by crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers , harry dodge and silas howa rd they manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style , and it's beautifully shot by ann rosetti , and wonderfully written truly poetic . the lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model / inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere . this film has so much energy , so much poignant passion and scruffy san francisco heart to it . i can not recommend it highly enough ! the best butch buddy movie of all time !
2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			cinematography compared to not he wrestler , a degree of verite and cinematic skill that disarms the viewer , and then hypnotizes as well . acting the dialogue is minimal , but the pauses and silence poignant . story the conflict in a balkanized denmark is volatile , as we saw recently jihad murders in the netherlands and riots in france . while i harbor no love for islam , the departure from the west from christian values holds no cause for celebration . the director of this film managed to mirror the two societies in a way that belabored neither , emphasizing the development of aicha as an individual who became a champion , not so much in the ring , but to all those around her . even her worst . . i will stop here to avoid the spoiler .
2			self	busy	it	good	movies	crappy	books	great	we	busy	cast	hilarious	i	surprised			i read holes in 5 h grade so when i heard they were doing a movie i was ecstatic ! of course , being my busy self , i didn not get chance to see the movie in theaters . holes was at the drive in just out of town but , alas , we were just too busy . i was surprised to hear that all my friends had seen it and not one of them had invited me ! they all said it was good but i have read great books that have made crappy movies so i was definately worried . suddenly the perfect opportunity to see it came . it was out that week and my parents were going on a cruise and i was left to babysit . my sister , who is 9 and i watched it and absolutely loved it ! i then took it to the other people i was babysitting's house and their kids , 9 and 4 liked it too . even my parents loved it and they are deffinately movie critics . overall , i recommend this movie is for anyone who understands family morale and and loves a hilarious cast ! this movie should be on your top 5 to see list ! !

2			productions	big	script	great	films	important	standards	average	auteur	special	films	enjoyable			perhaps , one of the most important and enjoyable greek films i have seen in the last ten years . excellent performances especially yiannis zouganelis is great , well written script and effective direction from a very special , for the greek very average standards , auteur . a film , obviously influenced by sam peckinpah's straw dogs , that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end . nevertheless , this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of greek movies which should be watched outside greece . it's a shame that in greece didn not work commercially , in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like politiki kouzina .
2			weaving	good	sensitivity	incredible	films	best	statement	extraordinary	punter	average	filmmaker	jealous	picture	best	skill	great	film	marvelous	departure	courageous			peaches is truly a marvelous film . i write this to refute a review from someone called auscrit , that has appeared on this site . first of all the idea that either monahans first film not he interview is somehow tv is an extraordinary statement . here is a film that has been significantly praised around the world as is simply one of the best australian films ever made . it fully deserved to win best picture . peaches is a brave , bold and courageous departure . for me it works on every level and i have now seen it twice . monahan is a filmmaker who is demonstrating great skill and incredible sensitivity . for auscrit to make the comment that it is another tv movie etc and that hugo weaving is no good simply does not get the film . or more particularly does not want to get it . frankly it is the sort of comment that one expects from either another filmmaker who is jealous or bitter or both . or someone from inside the industry either distribution , exhibition or bureaucracy . your average punter , i have found just does not write comments like that . i have noticed other comments on the site and reference to the film sommersault . one has to wonder what people think they are looking at . unfortunately in australia at the time ss was released the push was , if you did not like it then there was something wrong with you not the film . this manipulation of the media is pretty common down under . the reality is the only similarity between the two films are that they are rights of passage fil ms unfortunately for me ss is a film about nothing , that could have been told in 15 minutes . i see it as a one dimensional film about anxiety . peaches in comparison is a master piece . personally i cannot wait to what monahan does next as he is clearly way ahead of any of his contemporaries when it comes to cinema . in conclusion if the film does not win all at this years afi's and if awards , then it is a rigged game . as for auscrit , please find something more constructive do with your time
2			seem	robotic	movie	special			i had not seen this movie since the late 80 and decided to pick up the vhs version of it . the plot is very slow , and the actors almost seem robotic in this breakdance flick . the music , hip hop / freestyle artists and the breakdancing scenes are what make this movie special . the breakdancing is actually better in this movie than in breakin , but i have to say that breakin 1 2 carry the energy & excitement to the screen a lot better . it's a movie i will keep in my library , but it's not a movie that i can watch over & over again , just once in a blue moon .
2			cast	convincing			myself and 2 sisters watched all 3 series of tenko and agree this is by far one of the bbc better whole cast were very convincing in the parts they portrayed and although the 3 d series was somewhat slower it was compelling viewing and my evenings wont be the same without doubt we will be watching it again as it is a series which i would never get sick of watching . excellent viewing and full marks to the bbc for such a brilliant series and the casting . first rate in all departments and would recommend this series to anyone although some age limits must be considered because of some adult grateful to the bbc for releasing this series on dvd and video .
2			it	proof	woman	young	plot	simplistic	dialogue	witty	comedy	great	characters	likable			i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend , sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy . the plot is simplistic , but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer . while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction , i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love . this was the most i would laughed at one of woody's comedies in years dare i say a decade ? while i have never been impressed with scarlet johanson , in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average , but spirited young woman . this may not be the crown jewel of his career , but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends .

came first through this book and later at my university art house cinema . ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican , for condoning eva's desertion of emil , her subsequent divorce , and the brief swim she took in the buff , but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant , outstandingly beautiful , visual paean to love a view echoed by many imdb users . a very lonely young man , when i saw it , i willingly concurred . no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed . quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial . ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence , against which individual lives are insignificant perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term not he lifeforce . ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong . disappointed , she returns home and divorces him . soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding . she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience . her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing . but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself . after these exciting climacteric sequences , a bland , predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy , collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy . this story is trite , the acting is no more than adequate ; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage , as did most of its contemporaries , long ago . what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography , a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction , coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film . it is sub titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub titles , and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forwa rd this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch . the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it . for example , the names eva and adam ; the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him ; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery a bee pollinating a flower , a key entering a lock , a breaking necklace during eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam , etc ; and the final post suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society , as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on . as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8 for me the film will always remain a must see , although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment . unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930 s reaction to hedy kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood some critics , who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites , hula , back to god's country , bird of paradise or some of the early works of d . w . griffiths and c . b . demille , have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film . this scene was probably part of the original novel , and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it . two further thoughts ; firstly this is a czech film , released there in 1933 its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film were they removed from the copy i saw then ? secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime . we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience .
2			it	interesting	prints	great no	conversation	memorable	curtains	stereotypical	performances	good	scene	best			norman , is that you ? was this is all third hand , so take it with a grain of salt adapted to an african american family from a jewish one , when it made the transition off stage and onto screen . also , it was one of those movies originally filmed in video , so the prints from the theater can not have been that great . still , performances by redd foxx and others were pretty good . what i wanted to tell you all is that the movie is a period piece it reflected the attitudes in the mid to early 70 about finding out you have a gay son or daughter in your family . for that reason alone , it's pretty interesting if not a little hollywood . don not believe me ? check out lines about curtains , etc very stereotypical . not too deep . but . the movie really shines in a couple of areas . there is a side splitting scene when redd foxx is trying to find his wife , who's run away with his brother ! to ensenada in a souped up pinto . the phone conversation across the border is really memorable . but . the best scene in the movie is when wayland flowers and madame did his / their gay routine that he used to do in gay bars and nightclubs . to the best of my knowledge , this is the only time that routine was filmed . and , it's a slightly cleaned up and much shorter version , i m told . still , it's vintage madame , and shouldn not be missed . people are still stealing lines from wayland ; the man was truly gifted . enjoy the movie !

2			sense	great	measure	good	performances	strong	storytelling	inventive	fare	similar			this is the french and belgians doing what they do be st it's quirky , visually inventive , exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling . director jaco van dormael takes us into the world of georges , a down's syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone , just anyone . this is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty . georges interplay with corporate management guru , harry is dazzlingly handled shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease . the eighth day puts similar hollywood fare like barry levinson's oscar winning rain man or robert zemeckis's forrest gump well and truly in the shade . at times , it evokes the humour of milos forman's one flew over the cuckoo's nest with shades of dennis potter thrown in for good measure . as the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie , harry , daniel auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance . but it is matched by the brilliant pascal duquenne as georges . it's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many , memorable set pieces the shoe shop scene , car showroom scene , george's dance to genesis's jesus he knows me , the conference scene , the fireworks scene . if you haven not seen it , there's only one thing to do . just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you have been missing . better still , buy this movie . sheer genius . .
2			rhyme	perfect	resolution	soft	guy	average	acting	superb	theme	soft			this movie is a gem because it moves with soft , but firm resolution . i caution viewers that although it is billed as a corporate spy thriller and ms liu is there , it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace . it's not about explosions , car chases , or flying bullets . you must be patient and instead , note the details here . it's sedate because that's what the main character is . the viewer has to watch him and think as this story unfolds . i will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching . the plot is what you have read from the other postings an average white collar guy , seeking change and adventure , signs on for a corporate spy job . just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data . take it from there . this movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential , underlying suburban paranoia . then it begins to accelerate . the acting on all parts is superb and yes , some of the acts are caricature characters . but they all fit , and they entertain . and the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft , soft key sinister theme all is not right at the beginning . and at the end all is not what it see ms get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound this movie wants you to listen .
2			son	real	series	great	rowell	good	dyke	amazing	stars	great			this , like murder she wrote , is one of those shows , that after a stressful day at school , i sit down in front of the tv , and watch . why ? because i genuinely enjoy it , and it's a shame it's not on the air anymore . dick van dyke is amazing as dr mark sloan , a doctor turned detective , who with his son , solves murders . he is joined by a largely unknown but very competent supporting cast , namely his real life son , barry van dyke . victoria rowell is also good , but i noticed that every series her hairstyle changes . i also liked scott baio and charlie schlatter , but i particularly loved michael tucci as norman , and was puzzled how he suddenly disappeared . this show is so entertaining , with great guest stars , it's a bit obvious at times , like colombo , but in every episode , there is always something to chuckle about . in conclusion , a great series , with two thumbs up and a 10 10 bethany cox

2			demeanor	hilarious	he	little	it	funny	it	difficult	liners	hilarious	way	hilarious			this is one of those movies that i have seen so many times that i can quote most of it . some of the lines in this movie are just unbeatable . i particularly enjoy watching him stumble and fall while drunk , go out to the fancy restaurant drunk and the part with the moose . i don not know how many times i have seen this sequence but it's funny every time . from the moment arthur gets to susan's dad's place to the bit with the moose , you pretty much laugh the whole time . i remember watching the out takes regarding the bit with the moose . it went down just like i would imagined it would be like . they were all laughing so hard it was difficult for them to film it . the late sir john gielgud was a wonderful addition to this . his demeanor , his one liners and the way he handled arthur were all equally hilarious . it's always a funny moment when he whacks him over the head with his hat or tells him he's a spoiled little . i laugh every time i listen to the i m going to have a bath and the lines that follow .
2			industry	smart	level	new	way	true	i	impressed	relationships	romantic	period	great	issues	heavy			i had to give this film a 10 simply because it did what so many films thrown at black audiences have failed miserably to do . this film was void of all the video whore clichs , and it also skipped the gangsters , rappers , and foul language . it examined several relationships among physicians , african americans , and african american male / female romantic relationships on a completely new and refreshing level . i was highly impressed with the films careful mix of light headed humor with some pretty tough and heavy issues . the film will leave you feeling happy and sad all at the same time . i saw it at the boston film festival as well . it premiered at amc loews boston and i truly hope this film makes it to much larger audiences . black people and everyone else would love a movie like this if only the industry was smart enough to put them out there ! as an extra if your a doctor , a resident , a medical student , a premedical student , married to a doctor , have a doctor sibling , have a doctor in the family , or know a great doctor period they would love this film as well . it portrayed residency and the practice in a true to life way that was greatly appreciated by the doctors , residents , and medical students who viewed the film . dennis cooper completely his residency in internal medicine so he definitely applied his knowledge / experience to the film and that is greatly apparent .
2			movie	gorgeous	states	united	debt	tremendous	work	real	burden	international	mansion	old	it	realistic			this is a gorgeous movie visually . the images of the mexican desert , the old mansion , the characters in their picturesque amount to a real work of art . the story seems a bit loose , but that's because it's not meant to be realistic . it is taken from a book called one hundred years of solitude , and it is supposed to be an evocation of the isolated , otherworldly atmosphere of latin america so far from god , and so close to the united states . the tremendous debt that erendira owes to her grandmother is symbolic of latin america's international debt burden , although there many layers of meaning . if you can appreciate a slow moving , richly textured movie , this one is for you .

2			crime	true	thing	good	movies	gothic	underpinnings	psychological	sort	noticeable	order	highest	novelist	underrated	feelings	strong			when this film opened back in 1976 legend has that it was met with massive jeering and disdain it was widely considered a failure . i vividly remember ebert giving it one star and it was supposedly booed at cannes . apparently these people didn not understand the movie , which is not that hard to comprehend since it's very esoteric , dark , and layered in ways that still astound me . reading through many of the reviews here i find even after about 7 -8 viewings over the years many elements of the film i had previously glossed over . but even without understanding much the psychological underpinnings of the story , it's still a cracking if you just take the escalating paranoia and persecution that overtakes polanski's title character like a tsunami wave over the course of it's two hour running time . examining the source material an excellent novella by underrated novelist roland topor uncovers more intriguing layers . polanski's trekovsky is a milquetoast of the highest order . though he seems at first to be yet another mild everyday soul , one gradually realizes he is one of those people who seems to aimlessly drift through life , letting it direct him . he seems to have few strong feelings about his likes and dislikes . he finds himself gently pushed this way and that , but never seems to get too bent out of shape regardless . this vague sort of wishy washy ness is more noticeable in the novel than the movie , but there are hints of it early in the film too . making a play for the apartment of a woman , one mademouiselle choule , who is in the hospital recovering from a recent suicide attempt , appears to be the most daring thing he has attempted even effectively haggling down the price of the deposit in the bargain . he soon finds , however , that he is paying for his good thing in more ways than he cares , as he finds himself in the center of maelstrom created by a building full of neurotic , control freaks who are hypersensitive to even the slightest sign of human life , such as a footstep in the night or a knock on the door . instead of taking a stand though , trelkovsky becomes increasingly alienated by the situation , and overtaken by paranoia and a sense of persecution . he becomes obsessed with choule , imagining himself to be like her , dressing like her , etc as his own personality rapidly begins to be wiped away by his own insanity . if anyone has ever doubted polanski's fearlessness as an artist , they would be well advised to see this film . his trademark black humor is prominently and sometimes embarrassingly on display here and god bless him he makes himself the butt of it . it's a tour de force performance in one of the richest , riskiest , most gothic horror movies ever made . that more people haven not seen it is a true crime .
2			action	alive	action	best	plot	original			i am a massive fan of jet li ! he is the best hk action film star alive . and consequently this film rocked ! i saw it in the video store and , as it was in the mainstream section of this mainstream video store , i didnt register its presence at first , and had to look twice . i immediately knew what i would be renting out . my only qualm i suppose i expected it is that it was dubbed aaargh and not subtitled . elsewise , the movie's original / strange / cool plot , and full on action made it one of jet li's better movies . even though they all fall under that category .
2			dvds	good			and i gave it a high 7 . why ? because it bloody well rocked . at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys / games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories . as others have said here it was ahead of its time . sadly this is why the show was doomed . they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far . i am hoping that more come out . how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out . i don not know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation , and that imho is it's only flaw . the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition . . i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order . the dvds are good but i don not think the stories are in their proper order , but despite this the show rocked .
2			jokes	flat	eva	good	jokes	funny	jokes	original	b	crappy			i went into this film thinking it would be a crappy b rated movie . i came out surprised and very amused . eva was good , but lake bell stole the show . she had amazing comedic timing . the jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between . the plot was enough to tie it all together , a woman eva dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her was to be husband , its sounds far fetched but it actually works quite well . 7 10 overall its a worthwhile cinema watch , if not get it on dvd when it comes out .

2			type	different	it	great	budget	low	it	creative			it's great how this movie pulls you along . i had honest laughs . don not care that it's low budget cause the thing works for me . to be honest my wife didn not really go for it in the same way but she prefers a different type of film . she did admit though that it was very creative and well put together and probably all on a shoe string . these characters who's lives are strange and troubled give me something to relate to in my own world . just keep going and be who you are . dreams are what you make of them . in watching this movie a second and third time i realized that there are some hidden moments that passed by me on the first time through . what can i say , i like my fun with some complexity . anyway liked it . hope to see more .
2			idea	wrong	entertainment	good	disney	bad	hoods	young	job	good			holes is an awesome movie . i love it a lot and it's one of my favorite fil ms it's one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn not cheesy . holes is generally a very cool motion picture . i wish disney would make more pictures like it . holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool . don not get the wrong idea , i don not mean to bad mouth disney but most of it's stuff is aimed towards kids and that's okay . children deserve to have their entertainment too . but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail . but not with holes . it's the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it's corny . really , it's the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to . holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge . i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this .

2			predecessors	successful	television	live			the choice to make this snl skit into a movie was far better thought out than other recent ones . the humor involved in the character is not annoyance humor , and is also character driven enough to be stretched out for an hour or two . oddly enough the sexual content seemed like it could be avoided , but that may have been because the constraints of live television schooled me to not expect it . i suppose i was thinking more leisure suit larry risqu than the producers were . definitely not a pg -13 movie , which will probably hurt it from ever reaching the heights of its more successful predecessors , but still better premise and writing than its more dismal ones . i liked it , but i doubt it will be a smash hit . which is sad , as tim meadows tends not to do characters that annoy me with quite the frequency other snl alumni tend to
2			acting	great	music	erotic	world	new			this film had my heart pounding . the acting was great , the erotic music and the beautiful women add up to make this one a winner . the lead actress decides to join an escort service when she realizes that her husband has no time for her . she step's into a whole new world her first client being another woman . this is a film you definitely don not want to pass up .
2			film	current	concern	least	cliffhanger	great	ending	great	chases	good			sure this was a remake of a 70 s film , but it had the suspense and action of a current film , say breakdown . he's running , desperate to be with his hospitalized wife , the police are the least concern . the chases were very good , the part with him being cornered at a rest stop was well done , the end of the movie was a great cliffhanger . this is better than bullitt , a boring movie with what , a muscle car chase that was filmed badly ? vigo's character knew what he had to do to escape johnny law , few movies had the effects night vision , cb radio okay i forgot the name of the movie , guy has 76 caddy souped up , toys with guy he upset . the ending is great , you can not tell if he fakes his suicide or not , a very good did he make it or not .

2			one	exceptional	side	positive	experience	real	it	simple	music	soft	lease	new	thing	best	movies	best	senses	philosophical	genre	respectable			this is one of the best movies to come from bollywood in years . certainly the best this year until now . indian to the core , the panoramic visuals , the heart pleasing dialogs and the melodious and soft music make the movie an exceptional one . the apt depiction of indianvalues and culture makes the viewer search for his / her roots in them and invigorates the mind and spirit with a sense of pride and a new lease on life . this movie is for viewers who enjoy a call to their imagination and philosophical senses . if you like watching movies to get all your nerves excited through on screen action , sex or terror , then this movie is not for you , because you will find that the movie is not full of 90 degrees twists in it . it is as simple a story for a movie as it can get . but that's exactly where the art of the movie lies . one gets a real life experience , and the best thing is , this experience is one full of values and hope . it is about the positive side of life , about the sweet things that god has showered on humans , as against the regressive movies that insist on showing dons , terrorists and underworlds . this is not about things and people that have gone bad . it is about the goodness that still persists , and that keeps the world running . of course , every genre of movies is respectable but it takes a lot of courage and talent to come up with a movie that swims against the current and tries to open the eyes of the public to the hidden realities and truths . having said that , here's more . the movie is the journey of a couple from their engagement to their arranged marriage yes , that's right , it is an arranged marriage and the couple come to know each other only through their parents , and learn to love each other . the 6 month gap between engagement and marriage is a long time , not full of enticing happenings , but one that nurtures the growing love and devotion of the couple to each other . they learn together the importance of their relationship and of this invaluable period of their lives , and work to strengthen the bonds of marriage . but have these been strengthened enough ? their relationship will face the test of not only time but also fortune . will they pass this test ? that is what vivah is about .

2			exploitation	real	interactions	constant	evolution	bad	skills	artistic	importance	stylistic	situation	eccentric	fights	constant	household	eccentric	she	happy	it	disappointing	cinema	direct	age	old			when it first came out , this work by the meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation . luckily , it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema , especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television , and the bad evolution of most direct cinema . really , at first , we must say that this isn not really direct cinema , it is more cinema verit . the difference between the two is very slight , but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary , we are made to feel the presence of the meysels brothers , and they do interact with the characters filmed . this as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation . the meysels have been allowed in the house , and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household . and both edith and edie just love the idea of being filmed . it would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of god narration and shallow interviews . here , we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house , a madness that does seem to go down well with both edie and her mother edith . their house is a mess , litter and animals everywhere , faded colors and furniture all over the house , and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality . these two people have lived with each other their whole life , and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention , but rather because they can not help talking to each other this way . they know each other too well to hide their inner feelings , there is no need . in the end , though , even as they blame each other for their lives , they really love each other deeply . edie says she doesn not want her mother to die , because she loves her very much , and edith says that she doesn not want edie to leave her because she doesn not want to be alone . but the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age , the two women can not help be girls . they cannot help being one the singer , the other the dancer . exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera . when edie asks david meysels rhetorically where have you been all my life ? she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills . a beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again , the way only the meysels and few others could do .

2			world	real	movie	due	movie	violent	gun	single	watch	good			personally , i find the movie to be quite a good watch . it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized . not only that , it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don not just go all out and wipe out triads . overall , the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture . nevertheless , the movie stays true to the real world , thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens . i would recommend this movie to any triad / mafia movie fan . another good watch would be dragon squad . that movie has more guns than this , as in this movie there's more knives than guns in fact i don not remember seeing a single gun .

2			deal	great	releases	big	acting	superb	scene	touching	feel	involved no			this is a fascinating account of the hunt for the soviet union's first known serial killer . i had tuned in , just expecting a half decent tv movie , but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told . as others have said , there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases . much of the credit must go to chris gerolmo , whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in , until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved . the acting by the whole cast is also superb , especially that of the two leads , stephen rea and donald sutherland . their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility , and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after perestroika is genuinely touching . if you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen , i strongly recommend you look out for citizen x .

2			one	outstanding	friends	best	iowa	rural	friend	outstanding	one	specific	city	new	friend	best	it	equal	screen	big			i would have given this film a few stars , simply because it was a lifetime presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story here , new york city . most on this channel , whether set there , in rural iowa , oregon , virginia , l . a . etc , are filmed in vancouver , ottawa , toronto or some other canadian locale . but if there ever were one deserving the top rating 10 on this site , it's this movie . certainly not for originality , for this story has been done many times , in many variations , with several very similar to this specific one . it's also been done pretty often on the big screen , with mega stars , past and present , from cary grant , james garner , harrison ford , tom hanks , et al and deborah kerr , doris day , meg ryan , and many more . i can think of at least 10 -12 more , just as prominent , past to present , off the top of my head , who could be added now , and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind . not to drone on , but my point is that , in my opinion , this is by far one of the best of this genre i have seen . i caught it by chance on a mid day friday , at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week . i would never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made . and , while the two leads have done enough to be known to most , they were completely unknown to me . the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman anna's mother whom i would seen in some things from her younger days , and michael rispoli henry , charlie's best friend who was outstanding as gramma , the menacing juice loan , tough , street guy from rounders . the chance meeting and coupling between both leads best friends , as a sub story romance , with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later , is an oft done plot contrivance within the genre , but makes no difference to the enjoyment here in fact , it enhances it . checking some other comments , i agree completely with those which are the most positive . the primary word describing this film is engaging , in caps . this adjective describes the performers ; the characters ; the chemistry between and among all of the characters , in whatever combination presented , and all of the supporting and even minor roles . i love films with a harder edge rounders ; the escapist schwarzenegger / stallone fare ; goodfellows ; even the classics like casablanca , gone with the wind , citizen kane . but for pure , uncomplicated enjoyment , this one was outstanding . with a bare fraction of their budgets , it was equal to the results achieved by you have got mail and sleepless in seattle . and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn not have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here ; the co stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega films , as well .

2			story	little	possibilities	dramatic	partner	potential	i	pleased	difference	cultural	states	united	woman	beautiful			this is a cute and sad little story of cultural difference . kyoko is a beautiful japanese woman who has run to california to escape from a failed relationship in japan . ken is a japanese american manual laborer with aspirations of rock and roll stardom but little concrete to offer a potential partner . kyoko marries ken in order to be able to stay permanently in the the united states , with the understanding that although they will live together until she gets a green card the marriage will be in name only . it soon develops that the parties are not on the same wavelength or perhaps in the same time zone , hence the title of the movie . as an immigration attorney i have seen such arrangements take on a life of their own , so i was pleased to see how well the filmmaker developed the dramatic possibilities of this situation .

2			richardson	good	episodes	different	speeches	intellectual	actors	great	i	glad			this sci fi masterpiece has too many flaws after the editors had butchered it after its opening in 1936 visually it is a wonder to behold , but the script allows too many intellectual speeches about war and gets very corny when the actors are given to recite a lot of high minded messages at all times . raymond massey and cedric hardwicke , both great actors , come off as quite a pair of fanatics . ralph richardson is very good as the the boss a megalomaniac warlo rd the prediction of world war ii was very eerie considering that the world was on the brink of the most devastating conflict in human history at the time . i m sure glad that war didn not turn out as it did in the movie . there are some visually stunning montage sequences bridging the leaps of time between the movie's different episodes . although its not as entertaining as i hoped it would be , this movie sticks in your mind long after you have seen it .

2			it	enjoyable	characters	believable	teens	local	actors	young	california	southern			i was intrigued by the title , so during a small bout of insomnia fueled by my curiosity . i stayed up and watched it . i then checked my tv listings and watched it again ! there is one very obvious realization that occurred to me when i saw this film in spite of politics , traditions , culture , etc , teenagers everywhere are virtually the same . the characters of the kids from belgrade could have been transported to , let's say , somewhere in the american midwest during the same time period , and language differences aside , would be impossible to tell apart from any of the local teens of that era . they certainly displayed the same growing pains and preoccupations , politics aside music , sex , movie idols , music , drinking , sports , music . as a matter of fact , much the same things that occupied my time growing up in 1970 s southern california . this was a bittersweet story , but the joy of youth made it very enjoyable . the characters , especially the young actors , were completely believable also . i won not say this was the yugoslav american graffiti , but i will say that it fits in nicely with other 50 s themed movies .

2			hamlet	best	shakespeare	best	film	glorious	surprise	big	member	weakest	him	wrong	version	breathtaking	night	big	fortune	outrageous	body	entire	him	stiff			when i first read hamlet , i couldn not help but think of the ending of outrageous fortune , where bette midler puts down the play because of how indecisive he is , and says , give me romeo any day . five acts of a man trying to decide whether or not to kill his uncle or not ? seemed like overkill to me . but upon further reading , i grew to really appreciate the play . i have seen the olivier and gibson movie versions and part of the nicol williamson version , and all of them take their model from olivier ; the melancholy dane . olivier at least did it without being self indulgent about it , but gibson and , from what i saw , williamson , looked like they went to the look , ma , i m acting ! i m acting ! school . now here comes kenneth branagh's version , which is breathtaking from start to finish . it finished 2 on my top ten of 1996 behind the english patient , and ahead of lone star , jerry maguire , fargo , secrets & lies , everyone says i love you , flirting with disaster , big night , and looking for richard , and it's the best hamlet , and maybe the best shakespeare , put to film . obviously , branagh's talents as a filmmaker , for making the full length version , in 70 m print , and not losing our interest for four hours , is great , but what seems to get overlooked in discussions about this film is his performance in the title role . this was my favorite performance of the year by far . branagh avoids the melodrama which actors seem to get trapped in by playing hamlet as a normal , regular human being , and makes us understand his actions and feelings each step of the way . and unlike olivier , who depended mostly on his voice , branagh uses his entire body to demonstrate the range of emotions that hamlet goes through , but since he plays him as normal , none of it seems like scenery chewing . the rest of the cast is top notch as well . i didn not even mind jack lemmon , though i agree he was the weakest member of the ca st the most surprising turn came from charlton heston ; i have always found him stiff as a board , but he's quite commanding as the player king . the other big surprise was billy crystal ; i thought i would find him all wrong as the 1 t gravedigger , but he was his usual funny self while being in character . all in all , a glorious film !

2			advantage	outstanding	ankle	different	emotions	strong	topic	different	collage	great	style	different	story	good	bye	good	bye	best	actors	famous	capital	french			i watched this movie a couple of days ago in a small independent cinema in paris . it was my last evening in the french capital and the best good bye i could have chosen . these twenty episodes made me relive the impressions i had collected in paris in a heart warming manner without drifting off into kitsch or sentimental schmaltz . each episode is full of surprise , strong emotions and suggestive pictures and each short film is directed according to the rules of a good short story . to me this kind of movie demands a lot more talent and qualities of a director and a story board writer than any epic two hours drama and all of them succeeded in their task excellently ! the stories were chosen carefully with regard to their matching arrondissement and express the respective flair perfectly . each episode was seen from a different ankle , had a different topic , a different style and still the twenty stories result in a harmonic orchestra of fil ms the most outstanding advantage with the concept of an episode movie in my opinion is based in the fact that you can switch in between a large variety of feelings and moods without the danger of overload , just the other way round the melange of sadness , melancholy , pure joy , despair , wrath , anxiety , curiosity or passion gives this movie a unique freshness and harmony . and not to forget the all over topic of love ! love between the characters , love between the characters and paris and also the love of the directors and actors / actresses for this project . i don not want to go into the details of the episodes since there are so many , but i must highlight the range of world famous actors and actresses from all over the world and their approach to this project . some played with their image , some broke it completely and some interpreted the stereotypes connected with their home country or the roles they had played before , so intertextuality was given all through the movie . all in all i can absolutely recommend this great collage and will be looking forward to its release on dvd .
2			one	best	action	single	reasons	good no			this film quite literally has every single action movie cliche and all of them work to its advantage . straight from lethal weapon gary busey wisecracks , shoots and chuckles through this film with such reckless abandonment it can not help but amuse and entertain . there are tanks , helicopters , machine gun battles , grenades and ice cream vans and if they aren not good enough reasons to watch this film then how about the best one . danny trejo . and if you don not know who danny trejo is then you probably won not like this film .
2			song	great	voight	young	it	dull	film	boring			i recall seeing this film on tv some years ago and not paying full attention , maybe even missing the first half , so i came to the conclusion that it was dull and over rated . i decided to revisit it last night to see if i had missed anything the first time . i certainly did . this is one of the most disturbing and amazing films of all time and it has clearly had much influence on films today and probably will forever . i can not believe i thought this film was boring ! a young jon voight and burt reynolds give the performances of their careers and are supported by ned beatty and ronny cox . this story will leave you with a sense of disgust and dread long after you watch it , it is truly horrifying . oh , and did i mention that the theme song is great , as well ? well it is , and this movie should be seen by movie fans everywhere . everyone should see this movie for the experience . just don not expect a picnic .
2			priorities	different	ideologies	different			the first review i saw of page 3 said what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say ? should he say something so decisive . the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn not take sides . no propaganda whatsoever . this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue i don not know what do i call as an issue here and yet like any mediocre movie doesn not come up with an solution . i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started . the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic . i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead . so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times .
2			labor	hard	it	good	neill	excellent	it	bad			when the chamberlain family is camping near ayers rock , australia , lindy chamberlain meryl streep sees her baby being dragged out of their tent by a dingo and then begins an ordeal that no one should have to experience . for it seems like the dingo story is not believed by the public or the press , and the whole thing turns into a circus . lindy doesn not help matters either because she won not play to the jury or courtroom , she's only herself , and she's a tough nut to crack , so of course everyone thinks she's guilty because there's a piece of evidence that hasn not come to light . sam neill is excellent as michael chamberlain , a seventh day adventist pastor , who has doubts about his faith and perhaps about his wife . it's good or bad to see that people are just as prejudiced and stupid elsewhere as they are in the states too , because the australian public doesn not believe the story and the media only fans the flames . eventually , lindy is found guilty and sent to prison for a life of hard labor , but years later , a missing piece of evidence shows up and she's freed , but not until after the family's life is basically ruined . a heart breaking story , very well done , a bit long but well worth seeing . 8 out of 10
2			jackie	best	scenes	best	technologies	modern	stunts	impressive	stunts	memorable			maybe the movie itself isn not one of the best jackie chan's movies , but i think everybody will agree with me that the mall fight was one of the best fighting scenes ever made . there also was some memorable stunts , which were so impressive that they made this movie an action classic . this movie influenced many other action movies and i think that nowadays action movie makers should learn from this film like they could remake that chase scene , i thing with modern technologies they could make it even better . there also were some funny scenes which made this movie enjoyable even when jackie wasn not fighting . althou i think they could put more fighting scenes in this film .
2			story	true	things	amazing	name	close	town	real			this movie has some things that are pretty amazing . first , it is supposed to be based on a true story . that , in itself , is amazing that multiple tornadoes would hit the same town at night in the fall in nebraska . i wonder if the real town's name was close to blainsworth which is the town's name in the movie . there is an ainsworth , nebraska , but there is also a town that starts with blains something . it does show the slowest moving tornadoes on record in the the seen where the boys are in the house . on the other hand , the scene where the tv goes fuzzy is based in fact . before doppler radar and weather radio , we were taught that if you turned your tv to a particular channel not on cable and tuned the brightness just right , you could tell if there was a tornado coming . the problem was that by then you would be able to hear it . since i know something about midwest tornadoes , it made this movie fun for me . i enjoy it more than twister . i mean , give me a break there is no way you could make it through and f 5 by chaining yourself to a pipe in a well house .

2			daughters	old	cher	perfect	movie	brilliant			this movie is brilliant in every way . it touches on the complexities of loving relationships in a meaningful way , but never lectures . the script never condescends toward any character , not even the hapless johnny . it also and benefits from spot on direction , production design , casting , and performances . the fact that cher is so perfect in the film and is more unlike cher than she has ever been is a wonder to me . i watch moonstruck at least once a year and i just viewed it again this christmas eve with my 16 year old twin daughters and they loved it as well . it has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end .
2			timers	old	gage	true	they	mistaken	feel	thrilled	artists	great			this movie has the most beautiful opening sequence ever made . i have seen this movie for the first time a week ago , since then every day i see the opening and every time i feel as thrilled as i felt the first time i heard david niven uttering the immortal words from sir walter raleigh's the pilgrimage give me my scallop shell of quiet , my staff of faith to walk upon , my scrip of joy , immortal diet , my bottle of salvation , my gown of glory , hope's true gage ; and thus i will take my pilgrimage do you know why it would be a truism to say michael powell's and emeric pressuburger's lives are thoroughly justified for having crafted such a wonderful opening ? because they had been already admitted in the paradise of poets long before they made this movie . i imagine both of them facing trial during doomsday and saying nonchalantly to an irate god i beg your pardon , sir . so , do you want to know what have we done during our lifetime ? well , well you will see we have written directed and produced i know where i m going , colonel blimp , red shoes do you think that enough sir ? it is rather obvious that these two great artists had already fulfilled their duty with god , nature the muse or whatever you may call it when they shot a matter of life and death . the fact that other people's lives would be justified for their deeds could be not apparent to everybody , notwithstanding i feel my life would have a meaning had i never done anything else that to see this movie . of course old timers will be tempted to say they don not do movies like this one any more . they will be partially mistaken ; they didn not make movies like this in the past times either . i have have already quoted keats here , but i will repeat his words a thing of beauty is a joy forever .
2			depiction	great	it	great	friend	best	sums	great	screen	big	assassination	political	rags	classic	actors	greatest	destruction	total	figure	political	violence	graphic	sequels	potential	it	priceless	melee	entire	loggia	wonderful	job	nice			i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35 m print in honor of the 20 h anniversary of the films release . it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough . scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana . in this version , tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970 , early 1980 . tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant ; tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction . many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years . robert loggia as tony's patron , frank lopez is wonderful . his character is flawed by being too trusting , and as tony quickly figures out , soft . lopez's right hand , omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors , murray abraham amadeus . suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank ; it is like he does not have a mind of his own . tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez , but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top . the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein , the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin training day . mel , without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry . he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel . it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede , as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply , `it's your tree frank , you are sitting in it . this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection ! tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn . after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough . as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs , greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married . this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered . this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children . all in all this is a great depiction of 1980 excess and cocaine culture . depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around . the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind , particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen , the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie . this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish , or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels ; depalma let it all fly right here .
2			factor	good	cast	good	ladies	old	it	worth			i love this film . it's one of those i can watch again and again . it is acted well by a good cast that doesn not try too hard to be star studded . the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller . either would have killed the film completely . the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel good factor throughout . it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes . no that's not a spoiler !
2			carpenter	original	theme	similar	movie	fresh	jovi	good	film	original	i	impressed	way	similar	elements	different	performance	likeable			i admit that i am a vampire addict i have seen so many vampire movies i have lost count and this one is definitely in the top ten . i was very impressed by the original john carpenter's vampires and when i descovered there was a sequel i went straight out and bought it . this movie does not obey quite the same rules as the first , and it is not quite so dark , but it is close enough and i felt that it built nicely on the original . jon bon jovi was very good as derek bliss his performance was likeable and yet hard enough for the viewer to believe that he might actually be able to survive in the world in which he lives . one of my favourite parts was just after he meets zoey and wanders into the bathroom of the diner to check to see if she is more than she see ms his comments are beautifully irreverant and yet emminently practical which contrast well with the rest of the scene as it unfolds . the other cast members were also well chosen and they knitted nicely to produce an entertaining and original film . it is not simply a rehash of the first movie and it has grown in a similar way to the way fright night ii grew out of fright night . there are different elements which make it a fresh movie with a similar theme . if you like vampire movies i would recommend this one . if you prefer your films less bloody then choose something else .
2			part	best	side	important	side	visual	note	highest	it	interesting	it	original	side	artistic	they	disappointed no	boys	young	side	amazing			presque rien is a story of two young boys falling in love during summer stay by the seaside . i don not want to tell the plot , because it's not what's most important about this film but you can be sure that it's interesting and original . the best part of this movie is the cinematography . the visual side of presque rien is so amazing it deserves highest note . it leaves you charmed with its beauty . as for the plot , it is shown in uneven , rather complicated way . there is no simple chronology nor there are answers to all the questions the film brings . but this is what makes presque rien even more interesting . i recommend this movie to all the people for whom the artistic side of films is very important and they will not be disappointed .

2			occupation	busy	statement	powerful			this film provides us with an interesting reminder of how easy it is for so many to get caught up in the busy occupation of doing nothing . we as a people of african descent owe it to ourselves to make a change to this cycle of all talk and no action and start to realise in order to make a change , there needs to be less talk and more action . it is a powerful statement of the divisions of our people over small issues , and our failings to recognise the bigger picture and the need to unite in order to make a difference . despite its reference to the black community , all viewers can learn something from the message this film seeks to portray .
2			film	fun	body	flawless	soundtrack	terrific	era	specific	mol	underrated	bauer	fresh	cast	strong			greetings again from the darkness . mary heron is amassing quite the list of films which provide a glimpse into their specific era . her previous i shot andy warhol and american psycho were at their best when commenting on the quirkiness of society during that period . although the notorious bettie page is obviously about ms page , it is every bit as much a peak behind the curtain at the world of kinky photo shoots in the 50 s . the film is fun to watch both from the perspective of the story and the technical aspect of the way it was filmed and put together . the grainy b&w film and photos capture the time and the introduction of color in miami beach through the photos of bunny yeager is very well done . the supporting cast is strong with david strathairn fresh off his edward murrow role , chris bauer as irving klaw and lili taylor . the star of the film is the wonderfully talented and underrated and underworked gretchen mol . ms mol always brings an edge and spirit to her roles . she was absolutely mesmerizing in the little seen , jason alexander directed just looking in 2000 here she is the notorious bettie page . her smile is captivating and her body is flawless . she really seems to enjoy this role and helps us understand how the girl next door from tennessee could become the underworld pin up queen . as one would expect , the soundtrack from the era is terrific . patsy cline and peggy lee are just two of the featured performers . although the film hints at providing a history into this industry , the final third kinda falls flat preventing pure movie magic . but the magic of gretchen mol and bettie page make this a fun movie to watch and one that will yield endless showings on hbo in the near future . now will someone please turn ms mol into the star she should be ?
2			use	constant	cast	superb	dialogue	tight	plot	original			this has to be one of my favourite movies of all time . the dialogue , with the constant use of puns is very tight , the cast are superb , and the plot is highly original . don not take my word for it watch this movie and enjoy it for yourself .
2			work	great	girlfriend	french	one	great	movie	underrated	hajj	religious	tribute	impressive	it	enjoyable	woman	old	gap	religious	teenager	french	movie	long no	woman	scary			i don not know . maybe it's just because it's an impressive tribute to some muslim religious action hajj but i just felt the movie is so underrated . i just can not believe that the movie has just been voted by only 223 people so far given that the movie was produced in 2004 and it has won many awards since then . about the 's one of those well acted sweet , a french teenager due to sit for baccalaurat , is asked by his devout elderly father to take him to mecca . strange as it may seem if one doesn not know much about islam the father wants his son to drive them from their home in france to saudia arabia on a once in a lifetime religious generation gap between the father and the son is based on simple enough terms you may know how to read and write , but you know nothing about life , the unnamed father to his son but some sort of bromidic generation gap literature is of them are affectionate in their father never speaks in french though reda understands arabic but can only seem to answer in french . though they encounter many people on the road there's the scary old woman they pick up in the bosnian border on the way to belgrade , and the talkative mustafa jacky nercessian , who helps them out at the border of turkey , the reticent and shy women wearing burqas on the way to damascus the focus is always on the mismatched father and son . there is not much of a conversation in the movie which makes it enjoyable to your eyes . you see magnificent views in every city they director shows you even the blue mosque and the hagia sophia even though the movie is not relatively long . generally i don not like movies which don not have enough dialogs and which take their power from camera subtleties but this one was really great . despite some unanswered details like reda's unseen french girlfriend the movie appeals to senses . great work of art and remember this movie is ismal ferroukhi's debut .

2			caleb	good	powers	special	zone	dead	buck	great	zealots	religious	guy	good			i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from based on my other interests . they hit the nail on the head with this one . i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it . ten years later , it's like watching it all again for the first time . lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together , even though they are somewhat rivals . almost representing good caleb and evil sherriff lucas buck . i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be , but let it suffice to say , he has some special powers that i don not believe were granted by anything holy . he can make phones ring , writing appear , or even cause a person's emotions to change . none the less , there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all . all in all , this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of , that is , point pleasant , threshold , nowhere man , and seaquest dsv just to name a few were cancelled way before their time . the steven king's the dead zone sunday's usa network seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it . there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore . this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv . so , in the meantime , i will just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch quality shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons what a bunch of crap that is .
2			episode	single	episodes	old	series	watchable	friends	good	watchable	good	sparkle	old	series	best			i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode . i remember when i used to sit at 6 m every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon , however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill . the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie i m not sure which one that is . from there the next series friends with dreama was still really good , but when she left high school it just didn not seem right . all the main characters seemed to have left , which meant that it didn not have as much of the old sparkle , however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable , however when her aunt's leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isn not right . she is no longer a teenager , so therefore the name of the show isn not right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just doesn not seem right , especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isn not harvey . thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away . all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch , but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school . because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic
2			nothing	new			nothing new is this tired serio comedy that wastes the talents of danny glover and whoopi goldberg . considering that this was produced by the stars and spike lee , it's pretty tame and tired stuff . and how come the whoop never changes her hair or glasses over the many years this film covers ? blah !
2			father	biological	film	great	film	greatest no			i first saw this movie as a pre teen , about the age when kids start to think through their identity . i was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own . the eldest boy has been taunted that his mother is a prostitute and none of his siblings have the same biological father which kurosawa makes obvious by having children who look nothing like each other . the man still persuades tho boy that he is their father by the only definition that counts . the man is acclaimed to be father by all of the children but one , who still prefers her brother . each of the vignettes are likewise compelling for their own stories and conclusions . it's a great film , even if it is not the greatest kurosawa film .
2			styles	visual	latter	false	it	easy			it's easy to make really general comments about a film like this . the fact that it's one of the only remaining japanese films from this era causes people to say that it started japanese cinema and was unlike anything the west ever made . the latter of these two comments is particularly false as kinugasa himself admitted to ripping off caligari on more than one occasion . but style was meant to be imitated , and doesn not take away from this film's importance . what we have here is experimental themes and composition built on already established visual styles , opening the doors for a truly brilliant layering of narratives and realities . for this purpose , the madhouse is the ideal setting , and the writers knew this . this is a landmark film , and every effort should be made to track it down . 5 out of 5 essential
2			range	wide	capitalism	international	bank	central	tools	new	decision	economic	freedom	ironic	it	sad	agreements	international			it's sad to view this film now that we know how the anc got shafted by international capitalism . biko died for nothing much . woods achieved little . yes , outright apartheid was abolished , but all the apparatus of power was reserved by the minority whites , leaving the anc government more or less impotent . as naomi klein writes in the shock doctrine , in the talks between the black and white leaderships the deklerk government had a twofold strategy . first drawing on the ascendant washington consensus that there was no only one way to run an economy , it portrayed key sectors of economic decision making such as trade policy and the central bank as technical or adminsitrative . then it used a wide range of new policy tools international trade agreements , innovations in constitutional law and structural adjustment programs to hand control of those power centres to supposedly impartial experts , economists and officials from the imf , the world bank , the gatt and the national party anyone except the liberation fighters from the anc . the statistical results are horrifying , with not much change accomplished , and aids flourishing . viewing cry freedom in this light is deeply ironic actually tragic . the anc has transformed itself from being the solution to being the primary problem .

2			minutes	worthy	chance	big	powell	busy	glory	big	philo	original			s . s . van dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with hollywood . most of the film series from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios . but apparently van dine must have sold his rights to each book about philo vance one at a time . note that paramount , mgm , warner brothers , and more all released philo vance fil ms only tarzan seemed to get around hollywood more . mgm produced the garden murder case and starred edmund lowe as the fashionable detective . of course mgm had the screen's original philo under contract at the time , but bill powell was busy doing the thin man at the time and i guess louis mayer decided to concentrate him there . edmund lowe is a pretty acceptable philo vance . lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with what price glory and then with a string of films with victor mclaglen with their flagg and quirt characters . but after mclaglen got his oscar for the informer , lowe seemed to fade into the b picture market . the garden murder case involves three separate victims , douglas walton , gene lockhart , and frieda inescourt . the sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away , the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished . i will say this though . vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of hitchcock .

2			shocking	gratuitous	themes	strong	story	old	shame	real	him	open	scenes	important	film	grotesque	character	central	thumbs	big	scenes	shocking	reason	good	mansion	french			if , like me , you like your films to be unique , and unlike the majority of other movies , then i wholly recommend that you check out the bea st the film is a grotesque , erotic , fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological beast that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women . the film is very daring with it's subject material , and that is something to give it credit for . the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo , and for good reason , i might add ; but the film conveys it ; straight and to the point . like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre , the beast could have gone around it , and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps , but borowczyk didn not do that , and he is brave in that respect , especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms , but the fact that he went ahead with it , in my view , means a big thumbs up for the guy . the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female . this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience , in some ways , for the incredible , tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see . the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking , and are bound to offend many people hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years , but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer ; this film has a defining point . as said during the film ; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence . both man and beast have instincts , only man knows how to control them . the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality ; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire , and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the bea st the film has strong themes of the age old story of beauty and beast weaved into it , and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust , but not without a moral . many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring , but these scenes are important to the film's story . without these scenes , we wouldn not get to know the characters or the story of the beast , and , most importantly ; the story of beauty and the beast would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience , and as that is one of the key elements of the film ; it would be a real shame . besides that , borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes , not with shocks , but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family , along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen , and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either . overall , the beast is a shocking film . it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone . however , if you can get over the film's shock , and embrace the beast ; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance .

2			states	united	countries	different			this document truly opened my eyes to what people outside of the united states thought about the september 11 h attacks . this film was expertly put together and presents this disaster as more than an attack on the united states soil . the aftermath of this disaster is previewed from many different countries and perspectives . i believe that this film should be more widely distributed for this point . it also helps in the the healing process to finally see something other than news reports on the terrorist attacks . and some of the pieces are actually funny , but not abusively so . this film came highly recommended to me , and i pass on the same feeling .

2			daring	original	icon	classic			i fell in love with this silent action drama . kurt russell and only kurt russell could have played this so well . raised from childhood to know nothing but war and fighting , todd kurt russell is dumped on a planet after being made obsolete by genetically engineered soldiers . the stage is set and another classic icon of action movies was born soldier . not rambo , not schwarzenegger , not bruce willis , not mel gibson , not jason statham kurt russell owns this role and made it entirely his original , daring , and all too human . i miss the fact that sequels were never made . 10 10 ld my faith
2			message	wrong	disasters	biggest	views	political	movies	best	neill	great	job	good			when i first saw a cry in the dark , i had no idea what the plot was . but when i saw it , i was shocked at what it portrayed . when i saw it a second time in an australian cinema class , i realized a second point communication issues . you see , when a dingo snatched lindy chamberlain's meryl streep baby , she and her husband michael sam neill were grief stricken but didn not show it . as seventh day adventists , they believed that god willed this to happen , and so they couldn not mourn it . but when people all over australia saw their lack of sadness , everyone started believing that lindy did it herself . the point is , the wrong message got communicated to the public , and it turned people against lindy . even though this was a pure accident , it still happened . it may be one of the biggest disasters resulting from the existence of mass media , regardless of any media outlet's political views . as for the performances , streep does a very good job with an australian accent no surprise there , and sam neill is equally great . you will probably get blown away just by what you see here . definitely one of fred schepisi's best movies ever .
2			stars	big	works	outstanding	photography	magnificent	mood	magnificent	chills	additional	films	great			i have seen a great many films , but in cold blood stands alone in a class by itself . it excels in every department . the fact that it contained few big stars helps push it over the top as you pay closer attention to the characters and their story , rather than the name on the marquee . blake and wilson turn in stellar performances of the killer duo . the fact that much of the films is filmed in the actual locations where the crime took place , even inside the very house , add additional chills . the black / white photography darkens the mood and the photography is magnificent . there are many outstanding cinematic works out there , but if i could only vote for one to top the list , it would most probably be in cold blood .

2			part	best	communication	difficult	tierney	famous	race	mysterious	role	complete			this peabody award winning episode is one of the highlights of the 1 t season where a holodeck malfunction traps captain picard , beverly , data , and a starfleet historian named waylan within a 1930 s san francisco setting . this episode is an homage to raymond chandler's maltese falcon where patrick stewart assumes the humphrey bogart role complete with fedora and trenchcoat . the office itself is almost an exact replica of the one featured in bogey's maltese falcon . this episode also briefly introduces us to a mysterious insect race called the jarada that communicate with mostly a high pitched buzzing sound . communication with this alien race is difficult , and it is up to picard to communicate with this race in their native tongue so that negotiations and diplomacy can finally begin . the best part of this episode , though , is the appearance of the famous hollywood b actor lawrence tierney in the role of the gangster cyrus redblock . he was such a handsome man back in the 1940 s . oh , well .

you bet i do ! am not the least bit ashamed . if you haven not run into some of them , it's your loss but , there's a huge chance you have , but just didn not know it . so many moms , dads , sons and daughters could surprise you . it should be no secret many actors / actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of midnight cowboy . who is to judge ? i can name several , current big time stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities , and weren not the least bit damaged by their time spent there . i make no judgment , because these are humans , just as we all are love , courage , kindness , compassion , intelligence , humility you name the attributes , they are all there , no matter what the package looks like . the trivia about hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ratzo is a gem he can be seen driving his auto all around los angeles how do you think he gets his input ? i can also name lots of male stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money . although the nightclub i last worked in for 26 years was world famous and legit , i can also name some huge stars that had to be constantly chased out our back street , looking to make a pick up . this should be no surprise today , although it's definitely action in hollywood and other cities , large and small . wake up and smell the roses . they smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue . some of the users thought joe buck had been molested by his grandma . although i saw him in her bed with a boyfriend , i didn not find any incidence of that . believe it or not , kids haven not always had their own rooms because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going on in the master bedroom . whose business ? hoffman may have begged for change on the streets , but some of the users point out that jon voight was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy his actual salary would surprise you . i think he was robbed ! no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role , nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance . he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie . the end of the 60 may have been one of the first films to be so open , but society has always been hip . i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe they were clearly opposites , unappealing to one another . they found a much purely higher relationship true friendship . if you didn not understand that at the end of the movie , then you have wasted your time . joe's bewilderment , but unashamed devotion was apparent . yes , voight deserved an oscar for this role one that john wayne could never pull off , and he was as handsome in his youth . hoffman is hoffman you expect fireworks . he gave them superbly . wayne got his oscar . every character in this film was beautifully defined if you don not think they are still around , you are mistaken . the party ? attend some of the raves younger people you can get in . look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs you will see every outrageous personality . brenda viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty gritty at times . if you were shocked by her brilliant acting , thinking this isn not real , look at today's ladies who live on the brink of are admired for it . the brutality joe displayed in robbing the old guy , unfortunately , is also a part of life . you don not have to condone it , but it's not too much different than any violence . joe pointedly named his purpose in that situation , i would have handed over the money quicker than he asked for it . that's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break through , one which i do not watch . i get heartbroken for both . . john schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye opener waldo salt didn not write from clairvoyance . anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history , and should be proud for the honesty of it . perhaps only in america can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations , while other movie makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public . not looking doesn not mean it isn not there give me the truth every time . bravo ! to all .
2			effects	special	it	worth			i went looking for this movie in typical fan obsession . i just wanted to check it out . i was not expecting much of anything . after all , a musician , an actor and a screenplay writer ? not possible for so much talent to reside in one person . right ? wrong ! obsession aside , it quickly became one of my favorites ! the story line and characters are not lost in the typical hyped up hollywood special effects . the story plucks at your emotions and pulls you along . as the credits roll by , you suddenly realize you were glued until the end . at times , the acting seems a little over the top . i do , however , believe it's done with comedic intent and very fitting of the character . otherwise , i wouldn not have expected the level of acting witnessed . it's worth seeing more than once . i find myself laughing hysterically or gasping unexpectedly over something i either missed or forgot about the first time or two around . i completely recommend this movie . feel free to go in with your doubts , but i m sure it will find a place on your shelf .
2			self	bizarre	scenes	bizarre			spoilers . like other posters , i felt that the ending was a bit abrupt . i would have liked to have seen the crew adjusting to life back on earth after their return . i suppose the writers anticipated this problem by front loading some voyager on earth sequences at the beginning of the episode . of course , that time line has been eradicated , so it's all moot . i did like how admiral janeway died for the voyager crew . as fans , we get to have our cake and eat it to , by having janeway both make the ultimate sacrifice and live on . i admit that the scenes of janeway and her older self having conversations was bizarre and so easily could have crossed the line into camp . fortunately , mulgrew s pulled it off .

2			it	strange	hand	big	animation	great	animation	excellent	it	weird	animation	fantastic	issues	moral	cubs	adorable	track	great	i	surprised	movie	great			as a child i preferred the first care bear movie since this one seemed so dark . i always sat down and watched the first one . as i got older i learned to prefer this one . what i do think is that this film is too dark for infants , but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more , it doesn not seem as dark as it was back when you were a child . this movie , in my opinion , is better than the first one , everything is so much deeper . it may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one . the cubs are just too adorable , i rewind that flying my colors scene . i tend to annoy everyone by singing it . the sound track is great ! a big hand to carol and dean parks . i love every song in this movie , i have downloaded them all and is all i am listening to , i m listening to our beginning also known as are calling at the moment . i have always preferred this sound track to the first one , although i just totally love carol kings song in the first movie care a lot . i think the animation is great , the animation in both movies are fantastic . i was surprised when i sat down and watched it about 10 years later and saw that the animation for the time was excellent . it was really surprising . there is not a lot of back up from other people to say that this movie is great , but it is . i do not think it is weird / strange . i think it is a wonderful movie . basically , this movie is about how the care bears came about and to defeat the demon , dark heart . the end is surprising and again , beats any pokemon movie with the care bears moral issues . it leaves an effect on you . again this movie can teach everyone at all ages about morality .

2			continuity	important	message	superb	lighting	fine	storyteller	good	moments	dramatic	ways	important	accuracy	biblical	thought	enjoyable	story	compelling	potential	dramatic	characters	various			a thief in the night is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the rapture and the weeks following that pivotal event . i thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent christian movie . the production values . hey , it's an independent movie , with a shoe string budget , so , ya , it's going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is a list hollywood fare . but , properly compared with other independent movies , this film is perfectly acceptable . more important than acting style , costumes , and music is the narrative itself . is the story compelling ? do the dramatic moments work ? does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax ? the answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes . as a side note , the truly important technical stuff continuity , sound , lighting are fine . the viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship . content value . the message of the movie is superb . when you consider how many ideas the movie maker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes , you begin to appreciate his artistry . he presents the message of salvation , the consequence of unbelief , the danger of backsliding , the truth of the rapture , and the threat of a world dominating satanic government with flare , imagination , and most importantly for an evangelical movie with biblical accuracy . the movie maker is a good storyteller . for example , he develops the message of salvation in two important ways 1 he shows us through action the reality of jesus christ's sacrifice for our sake . this is achieved in a subplot where the zoo keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies . the only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake poison . the poison is like sin ; the cure is like christ's blood , shed on the cross . 2 the filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog . he has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in chri st so , the movie maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story . as a side note , the fact that a movie produced by evangelical christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation , couched in explicitly evangelical christian language , imagery , and theology is also perfectly acceptable . to criticize this film for being explicitly christian is absurd ; it's akin to criticizing a nike commercial for promoting sport wear . what else would evangelical christian movie makers make , if not a film that states their case ? also , the fact that the movie maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is , again , perfectly acceptable . the movie maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably . how do i know ? i heard about a thief in the night from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later . how many movies can you say that about ? all around , a very enjoyable , thought provoking show . i plan on showing it to my teen group at church .

2			concerts	finest	artist	original	lovin	new			this is one of the finest music concerts anyone will ever see and hear . i grew up when all my lovin was brand new and to hear it again today by the original artist today is a measure of sir p mc's power to spellbind any crowd of any age . this doco goes way behind the scenes to show us life on the road not just for the band but everyone down to the roadies . i saw this guy live in aussie 1975 and can assure you his performance here on this dvd is no less than he gave almost 30 years ago . i have a huge 5.1 surround sound system that does do this justice and would recommend this anyone especially a beatles fan . this is the closest you will get to a beatles concert today . singer , songwriter , lead / rhythm / bass guitar , piano , ukulele , just pure genius . there are few entertainers who can stand alone with one instrument and hold the crowd in his hand . if you want note perfect music , buy a studio recorded cd . if you want to hear raw music as it is intended and spontaneous to the crowd , with all the excitement and emotion of the crowd this dvd is for you .
2			plot	simple	girl	naive	role	sophisticated	humour	clean	movie	enjoyable	portrayal	charming			i find this movie very enjoyable . the plot is simple and easily digestible , the humour is light and clean , and because the storyline involving mistaken identity is quite common , i find myself looking forward to how this movie flesh this story out . turns out to be very nice . the performance of the female lead is admirable ; her portrayal of an innocent , naive girl trying to fabricate some white lies to david's sophisticated role was very charming . i also find vera's dancing very , very well done . i find myself drawn to her toes as she pranced about the stage effortlessly and flawlessly . for those who have had enough of profanity filled movies of today , you will enjoy this movie thoroughly .
2			adaptation	excellent			the film adaptation of james joyce's ulysses is excellent . the actors , the voice overs , the direction , it all captures the feel of the novel without sacrificing its own merits . the milo o'shea does an excellent job as leopold bloom , the cuckolded man married to the sassy molly . i absolutely love this picture .
2			loretta	young	movie	little	cases	difficult	performance	outstanding			even in the 21 t century , child bearing is dangerous women have miscarriages , and give birth prematurely . seventy five years ago , it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth . that is the theme of life begins a look at the difficult cases ward of a maternity hospital . loretta young plays the lead , a woman brought here from prison what crime she committed is not germane to the plot to give birth ; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth . she's in a ward with several other women , who share their joys and pain with each other . although loretta young is the lead , the outstanding performance , as usual , is put in by glenda farrell . farrell was one of warner's b women in the 1930 , showing up quite a bit in supporting roles , and sometimes getting the lead in b movies farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the torchy b movie series . here , farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn not want her children , since they will only get in the way . she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses , including smuggling liquor into the ward this of course during the prohibition days , and drinking like a fish apparently they would never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30 . interestingly , unlike most movie of the early 1930 , it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men that situation is reversed , with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly . watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers . life begins , being an early talkie , treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama , to be sure , but it's quite a charming little movie . turner classic show it , albeit infrequently ; i have only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young . but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up .

tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway john bennett as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood . one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood . this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers . incredibly , the number of depictions of violence on screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination , all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence . in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless , from the faultless performances of the star studded cast featuring the legendary peter cushing , christopher lee and ingrid pitt all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch the author of the novel psycho . the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood are the somewhat asinine plot twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture , but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment . the first segment , entitled method for murder , tells the story of charles hillyer denholm elliott , a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel . while working on the novel , hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality . elliott's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability . the key to this segment , as with the others , is the mystery surrounding the events that take place . the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination , a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there . duffell's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow , methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling . the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house . during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in . while there , he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him . cushing's character philip is then joined by his friend neville joss ackland who also wishes to visit the museum , much to the dismay of philip . in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark . there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story . duffell's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories , there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks is still a delightful entry into the film . waxworks is followed by what is , in my opinion , the greatest of the four segments sweets to the sweet . christopher lee stars as john reid , the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton nyree dawn porter . however , john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family . sweets to the sweet is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer . throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family , but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place . this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great . accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack , sweets to the sweet is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease . personally , i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 10 10 the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in . jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie . pertwee's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries . however , strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the wor st this segment , which places the inspector amongst the events , is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology . although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is , in a way , what makes the story so enjoyable . unfortunately , there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features . horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwee's brief comment on bela lugosi's and christopher lee's portrayal of dracula . this slightly comical and light hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense driven horror . to sum up , the house that dripped blood is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast , great stories and above par direction . there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed , fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely . my rating for the house that dripped blood 8 10
2			thing	bad	expectations	low	she	perfect			my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore . i think the title especially put me off . i can not ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over . i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store . it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did . i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life . the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly . i could have kept watching for hours . another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since . she is so perfect in this movie . this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			i think the opening 20 minutes of this film is perhaps one of the most exciting filmed , with the brilliant music score working to build tension to a shattering climax . what cinema goers made of this in the 30 , i can only imagine . the not imes said at the time , a miracle has come to the screen . watch it and marvel .
2			fan	obsessive	firm	local	it	hard	woman	young	opinion	humble	pupils	best	ways	uncanny	themes	gross	barrymore	natural	fans	british	things	marvelous	comedian	popular			the farrelly brothers , bobby and peter , are at it again . with fever pitch the creators of other films that have dealt with a lot of gross themes , abandon that tactic when they decided to bring nick hornby's film to the screen , something that it would have been hard to do . the novel , of the same title , dealt with a man's obsession with soccer , since it is set in england , where that sport consumes most of british sports fans . it's to the credit of the writing team of lowell ganz and babaloo mandell , to transform the book into a language that would appeal to most americans , when they make their hero , a boston red sox fan . fever pitch is a film that presents an obsessive fan , ben wrightly , whose life revolves into the red sox season , and who is an eighth grade teacher with uncanny ways for involving his students into the subject he tries to teach them . when ben takes four of his best pupils for a tour of a local firm , he meets , and falls hopelessly in love with the brainy lindsey meeks , a young woman who is going places , but at thirty , has no life of her own . the story follows the two lovers through the ritual of attending the red sox , at home games , in fenway park . this team's fans are probably the most loyal people in the world , having stuck with a team that does marvelous things but , until 2004 never won a world series . in fact , the ending , from what we heard , had to be changed because that was the year in which they finally won the event that had eluded them for eighty six years ! drew barrymore and jimmy fallon are perfect as the couple at the center of the film . ms barrymore is a natural who always surprises in her appearances in front of the camera . jimmy fallon , a popular television comedian , turned movie actor , has a better opportunity here than in his last appearance in taxi , in our humble opinion . the farrelly brothers film will satisfy their fans as well as baseball fans with this baseball tale .
2			placement	good	it	great	decisions	poor			i barely remember this show , a little , but i remembered it was great ! my eldest brother , reminded me about the show recently and i had seen an advertisement for the d . v . d set coming out . the network , again screwed up in pulling this from the air , so that they could put what else in it's place ? it should have gone at least 3 seasons . why not , right ? i think sometimes that the network executives think they are the gods of the entertainment world . but they mis guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time . let it be said that , they have a lot more flops than hits . this was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up . anyhow , i am getting this for my collection .
2			activities	daily	rejection	real	heart	new	nénette	inexplicable	border	french			clair denis again revisits her theme of estranged fathers , men who follow their own bliss in determined fashion , heedless of the emotion toll on their family but while nnette and boni from the earlier film live in a narrow world of marseilles , our examination of louis trebor in the intruder takes us from a remote location along the french swiss border to half way around the world , to korea and tahiti . again the film begins in mid stream , with louis , in his sixties , coping with an ailing heart while attempting to maintain a high level of fitness . we learn that louis is no stranger to violence as his cabin is the location for smuggling and gunfire a regular occurrence . louis sleeps with a large knife under his pillow with rifles nearby . denis is in no hurry to move the action along , and we must patiently build our understanding of louis from his daily activities and the few people he deals with along the frontier including a son , sidney grgoire colin , almost unrecognizable with long hair and a wisp of a mustache who rejects him as a lunatic , shown as a dedicated father of two . there are many brief scenes which , while seemingly unrelated , build up an impression of louis and his milieu . ms godard's camera work is exhilarating here . the controlling metaphor is louis's heart transplant for which he goes to korea and then to tahiti to search for another son , not found , and where louis's new heart rejects him just as sidney rejected the old . we are accustomed to brief scenes in denis's film which are inexplicable nnette astride boni feeding with a spoon ; a drive by shooting of boni's father and then the briefest of images of boni with a gunshot wound in the head ; a scene of louis in a morgue with a cadaver with the scar of a transplant but the body of sidney . the implication , of the last two , is a rejection , real or imagined , by a father , kills something indefinable in a son .
2			scenes	best	energy	great	actor	outstanding	behavior	cultural	richard	little	dancer	good	writing	good			the life and time of little richard , as told by little richard , as produced and directed by little richard , was about as one sided as one of his songs . this is not a biography or even a docudrama , but does have good writing , great energy and an outstanding leading actor playing richa rd all the music is by little richard , so it rocks a tight lipsync on every song . the movie covers his early childhood , carrys thru the formative years in music , the wild success and richard's throwing it all away to praise the lo rd its all tied together well and the obvious comeback in 1962 manages to stay away from the idea that little richard discovered the beatles , whom opened for him . my main objection is that his outrageous , counter cultural behavior is underplayed and you get no feel for how his audience experienced him at that time . some of his energy , which he still has , does not come across full force . he seemed tame , compared to what i remember of him at the time . the best scenes are richard getting jilted by lucille and writing a song about it and the strip to bikini shorts while performing , to make the point about not having a decent place to change . if they had gotten into the bronze liberace as richard use to refer to himself in interviews , then there's a story . trust me i just saw him perform a couple of months ago and he still flirts with the pretty white boys , giving the one particularly good dancer in the audience , his headband . nearly 68 and still going strong i recommend this movie and any concert or t . v . appearance you can find . little richard is always on
2			it	magnificent	fact	historical	nobleman	russian	war	civil	decarlo	beautiful	francisco	great	cleve	accurate no			miss decarlo's starring debut has everything the writers could come up with from the franco prussian war to the us civil war , the great american west , san francisco in its heyday , ballet , opera , vaudeville , stage coach bandits , and a chinese junk . just when you thought the plot couldn not get any screwier , it does . it's magnificent , taken tongue in cheek . decarlo's character here called anna marie not salome , that's the role she dances is loosely based on the career of the notorious lola montez , who was the mistress of the king of prussia and caused a revolution when he gave her the crown jewels . she did escape to the american we st there is a town in arizona called salome , where she danced , based on the historical fact that lola montez did dance the role of salome there . stagecoach cleve and the russian nobleman who fall under her charms are not historically accurate , nor i assume is the chinese wise man with the scottish accent but it is one of my favorite all time camp classics and decarlo is breathtakingly beautiful throughout .

2			buster	concerned	genius	greatest	him	famous			buster absolutely shines in this episode , which is the only vehicle i have seen towards the end of the career that allowed him to do the physical and silent ! comedy that made him famous . it's still a shock to hear his gravelly voice in the talkie sequences his voice is about the only thing i don not care for , as far as buster is concerned but his ability to take a pratfall is still unparalleled . he even repeats some of the gags used in his early two reelers with roscoe arbuckle . my deepest gratitude to rod serling for presenting us with this episode , and for giving buster's genius full scope . he didn not have much time one episode to do it in , but this is a touching tribute to hollywood's greatest genius .

2			songs	great no	things	bad	movie	great	songs	nice	people	cynical	nothing	perfect	thing	important	i	young	movie	fun	movie	smart	itself	fun	i	surprised	it	perfect	use	great			i have seen this movie when i was young , and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy . so , in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie . to my surprise , the movie held to my every expectations . it's a great movie . emotional in the right amount , some jokes , nice songs not great though , and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical and all in all a great use to my time . i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie , which i first saw in the second grade , made me cry today just like it made me cry then . maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not , but the important thing is that it made me feel , and that's why filmmakers make films that and the money , of course . yes , there are continuity glitches . yes , the script has holes , but it doesn not matter . the movie itself is fun and smart . so don not be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life , because nothing is perfect , and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect . it gets 10 simply because it made me feel .

2			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			i saw the movie before i read the michelle magorian book and i enjoyed both . the movie , more than the book , made me come close to tears on several occasions . this film touches the deepest points of the human soul and never lets go . i encourage as many people to watch this masterpiece as much and as soon as possible . i give it ten stars .

2			me	sick	matter	controversial			i saw this when i was 17 and haven not seen it since . the cbs late movie used to show it on a regular basis at one point . i remember how sad and upsetting it was , it truly made me sick to my stomach . effects then weren not what they are today , but nevertheless , it conveyed the feeling of being alone in the amazon , after losing both parents and searching for a way out , very well . i remember the bugs and maggots the most , so realistic they were , eating her flesh . it's a dark film which was controversial subject matter at the time , even though likely it was strongly edited for tv . i wish i remembered more details , and if i ever get the chance to see it again , i can comment more . i have been looking for this for years . i believe it may have been shown on cbs under yet another title . i have no idea whether it was ever released on video .
2			screen	big	jo	lovable	they	impressed	father	popular	movie	inevitable	value	good	original	british	sitcom	original	television	british	fan	big no			some years ago , satellite channel u . k . gold promoted repeats of men behaving badly with the hype here it is , the original flat sharing sitcom ! this was in fact untrue . man about the house was also a flat sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 -76 it was the brainchild of johnnie mortimer and brian cooke , creators of the popular sitcom father dear father . when it ended , they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times . in the first episode , chrissy paula wilcox and jo sally thomsett are tidying their myddleton terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath . he is robin tripp richard o'sullivan , a southampton cookery student of no fixed abode . while his clothes dry out , he puts on a ladies dressing gown and prepares them a meal . they are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay . but there must be no naughty business . so robin has to pretend to be gay . on bbc -2 s i love 1973 , shown in 2000 julie burchill claimed that house showed her a way of life she envied . she was not alone . one of the most iconic for me , anyway images of 70 s british television was sally thomsett coming out of the london underground carrying a parasol , and a blind man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings pa st a man living with two girls was a risqu subject for the time , but whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar , it was innocent , good natured fun . mortimer and cooke's scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it . richard o'sullivan was still playing bingham in i . t . v . 's would octor in charge when this got started . in fact the second run of in charge overlapped with the first of house . he was born to play the sex mad robin . paula wilcox's chrissy was more streetwise than beryl , her character she played in not he lovers , while sally thomsett's jo was a lovable dizzy blonde . as time wore on , he became almost like an older brother to them . for many viewers , brian murphy and yootha joyce stole the show as the warring ropers . george had lost interest in sex , but mildred had not . they went on to their own show the aptly titled george & mildred . the late doug fisher was good value as as robin's wideboy friend larry . he worked so well he was made into a regular . within a year of its debut , there was the inevitable movie spin off . i am not a big fan of the man about the house movie because i think it was stretched to fit the big screen . most of its characters had never appeared in the series . the format was sold to america , where it became the long running not hree's company starring the late john ritter and suzanne somers . it was far more suggestive than the british original , with somers often seen in sexy clothing . after six seasons , house ended with chrissy marrying robin's older brother norman norman eshley . fans were devastated to see robin failing to get the girl he loved , but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show robin's nest .

2			wisbar	german			very well done and spooky horror movie from poverty row film company prc who usually put out really cheesy films like devil bat or the flying serpent . german expatriate director wisbar does wonders with a small budget and his studio bound swamp set . gaunt and ghoulish charles middleton is effective as the strangler .

2			correctness	political	network	different	interactions	rich	material	rich	release	direct			creature comforts in america should have been released on a different network , or at least been given the chance to have its full run of episodes . unfortunately , this was not the case . given that american audiences seemingly have the attention spans of a gnat when it comes to the humor that does not consist of profanity laced diatribes , or has a preoccupation with scatological functions both sound and smells , shows like this will be few and far between . one of the main problems was that however brilliant it was , it was made for a rarefied audience who knew what to expect but was viewed by an audience and board rooms that did not have a clue at to what they were watching . which is sad , but not unexpected . i would have liked to have seen at least three more seasons of this show even if it was produced for direct dvd release . the material and the interactions between the creatures were rich with sub context and there were other conversations just waiting to be had under the surface . but thanks to political correctness , such conversations take place only in my mind .
2			action	fantastic	town	biggest	design	memorable	story	entertaining	part	big	film	best			having seen most of ringo lam's films , i can say that this is his best film to date , and the most unusual . it's a ancient china period piece cranked full of kick ass martial arts , where the location of an underground lair full of traps and dungeons plays as big a part as any of the characters . the action is fantastic , the story is tense and entertaining , and the set design is truely memorable . sadly , burning paradise has not been made available on dvd and vhs is next to impossible to get your mitts on , even if you near the second biggest china town in north america like i do . if you can find it , don not pass it up .
2			ending	weak			this amusing bugs bunny cartoon sees the return of the still unnamed marvin the martian and his sidekick k -9 the green dog . this time instead of trying to destroy the earth marvin is on a mission to land , capture an earth creature and take it back to mars . of course the creature he picks is bugs bunny . at first bugs thinks marvin and k -9 are trick or treating but realises this can not be right when marvin drastically enlarges bug's rabbit hole with a ray gun . bugs tries to trick his way out of the situation in a couple of ways , including persuading marvin that k -9 is planning a mutiny . eventually he is captured using an acme strait jacket ejecting bazooka . amazingly , for an acme product , it works as advertised and bug's is forced to use his wits to get k -9 to release him , the tables are soon turned and the two disgruntled martians are trussed up and bugs is trying to fly their saucer back to earth . i really enjoyed this although the ending is a little weak compared to the rest of the story . marvin's voice has changed slightly here and he gets visible emotional when he is angry but this didn not make me like him or the cartoon any less .

2			actress	best	aspects	positive	character	ill	it	due no	correctness	political	christy	young	life	difficult	life	hard	opposition	strong	acting	convincing no	award	best	hunter	best	we	aware	person	disabled	he	incapable	he	difficult	palsy	cerebral	drinker	heavy	facets	different	actor	best			a noted cinematic phenomenon of the late eighties and early nineties was the number of oscars which went to actors playing characters who were either physically or mentally handicapped . the first was marlee matlin's award for children of a lesser god in 1986 and the next ten years were to see another best actress award holly hunter for the piano in 1994 and no fewer than five best actor awards dustin hoffman in 1988 for rain man , daniel day lewis in 1989 for my left foot , al pacino in 1992 for scent of a woman , tom hanks in 1994 for forrest gump and geoffrey rush in 1996 for shine for portrayals of the disabled . matlin , who played a deaf woman , is herself deaf , but all the others are able bodied . this phenomenon aroused some adverse comment at the time , with suggestions being made that these awards were given more for political correctness than for the quality of the acting . when jodie foster failed to win best actress for nell in 1994 some people saw this as evidence of a backlash against this sort of portrayal . my view , however , is that the majority of these awards were well deserved . i thought the 1992 award should have gone to either clint eastwood or robert downey rather than pacino , but apart from that the only one with which i disagreed would have been hanks , and that was because i preferred nigel hawthorne's performance in the madness of king george . in that film , of course , hawthorne played a character who was mentally ill . my left foot was based upon the autobiography of the irish writer and painter christy brown . brown was born in 1931 one of the thirteen children of a working class dublin family . he was born with cerebral palsy and was at first wrongly thought to be mentally handicapped as well . he was for a long time incapable of deliberate movement or speech , but eventually discovered that he could control the movements of one part of his body , his left foot hence the title . he learned to write and draw by holding a piece of chalk between his toes , and went on to become a painter and a published novelist and poet . life in working class dublin in the thirties and forties could be hard , and the city jim sheridan himself a dubliner shows us here is in many ways a grim , grey , cheerless place , very different from our normal idea of the emerald isle . sheridan and day lewis were later to collaborate on another film with an irish theme , in the name of the father . against this , however , must be set the cheerfulness and spirit of its people , especially the brown family . much of christy's success was due to the support he received from his parents , who refused to allow him to be institutionalised and always believed in the intelligence hidden beneath a crippled exterior , and from his siblings . we see how his brothers used to wheel him round in a specially made cart and how they helped their bricklayer father to build christy a room of his own in their back ya rd the film could easily have slid into sentimentality and ended up as just another heart warming triumph over adversity movie . that it does not is due to a number of factors , principally the magnificent acting . in the course of his career , day lewis has given a number of fine performances , but this , together with the recent there will be blood , is his be st he is never less than 100 convincing as christie ; his tortured , jerky movements and strained attempts at speech persuade us that we really are watching a disabled person , even though , intellectually , we are well aware that day lewis is able bodied . the other performances which stand out are from fiona shaw as his mentor dr eileen cole , from hugh o conor as the young christy and from brenda fricker as christy's mother which won her the best supporting actress award . the other reason why the film escapes sentimentality is that it does not try to sentimentalise its main character . christy brown had a difficult life , but he could also be difficult to live with , and the film gives us a warts and all portrait . he was a heavy drinker , given to foul language and prone to outbursts of rage . he could also be selfish and manipulative of those around him , and the film shows us all these aspects of his character . of course , it also shows us the positive aspects his courage , his determination and his wicked sense of humour . day lewis's acting is not just physically convincing , in that it persuades us to believe in his character's disability , but also emotionally and intellectually convincing , in that it brings out all these different facets of christy's character . his oscar was won in the teeth of some very strong opposition from the likes of robin williams and kenneth branagh , but it was well deserved . 8 10

clearly these friends are now turned , the funniest on camera line belonging to khouri's qld neighbour rachel richardson who speaks her disillusionment in flat , no nonsense colloquialisms i think it's a load of sh ! t . personally . we need to learn from their experience , hence my belief in spoilers . any perennial lie spinner caught out in a lie will just say anything to buy time to tell another lie . there's some breathtaking footage of khouri cackling derisively at duping this very documentarian , who instead presses her con artist repeatedly for corroboration . since being busted by sydney morning herald journalists caroline overington and david knox a year after publication , khouri has been on the run , but was tempted back to the director to supposedly clear her name . she absconded supposedly because a she's either terrified of her sly , more italian sounding than greek husband , or b because she needed her passport / visas to clear her name . unlikely . a more plausible reason was that the fbi regained her trail in queensland before she again skipped overseas one guess no , not jordan . according to a closing card , khouri is still under investigation by the fbi in 2007 i guessed audiences might just give khouri the benefit of the doubt once she invoked the need for utmost secrecy and subterfuge . instead , the audiences i sat with slowly became just as disillusioned as the duped people on the screen . once they caught on , there was plenty counter derision and catcalls ; earlier , stressed sighs had emanated from audiencemembers who just didn not know how to take khouri's evolving contradictions . the filmmaker gets props for so beautifully spanning this convoluted tale from beginning to end , not leaving anything out not even her own self sacrifice . anna opens her film with a sympathetic book narration by khouri herself . the putated reason for authoring it is retold very believably at first key to how a lifelong liar operates in half truths . khouri is nevertheless a very pretty and smart 35 r old with rather disarming charm , and surprisingly , worked out biceps . gradually we are introduced to less and less adulating aussie journos , publishers and fans who at first bought the extent of khouri's honour killing accusations hook , line and sinker . later we see their more rueful reactions , quite self controlled and matter of fact , if some perhaps a little bitter . it was jordanian anti honour killing activists who took deepest umbrage at khouri's fallacies because its pot stirring forced them to reduce the pace of change . honour killings do happen in jordan ; it's just their prevalence that's at odds with khouri's book plus 72 other facts . in 2003 these activists faxed australian random house with 73 painstakingly checked objections . the publishing houses across 4 continents who would jumped at the chance to publish first time author khouri never tried to check any facts . leaving any corroborration to a disclaimer in their author contract , they too were fair game . so a massive hot topic fraud was as easy to perpetrate upon the world as typing it up in internet cafes . later still we are shocked to discover that the factual errors extend to khouri's bio as well . for one thing , she's not only not a 35 r old virgin her defence is that she merely didn not disabuse people of their assumptions , but she has a slickster husband and 2 teenagers ! sometimes she's just too fast talking in her american accent . she also seems too comfortable with cellphone technology and western clothes . i realise observations like these might sound prejudicial to the very jordanian women who don not need any western paternalism from me , but when even cultural cues don not jibe in addition to khouri's facts , you have got to start questioning your source . at some point the filmmaker came to the same conclusion . she makes an admirable effort to hold khouri to account , in person , in jordan . the last third is consumed with a fact finding trip back to amman , where one fact after another falls . eventually broinowski forces her con artist to admit the decade discrepancy in her story , and it's after this that khouri records her derisive secret confession into her own digital camera . secret , because in it khouri's american security guard jeremy is heard to have an australian accent he's an actor ! we never find out how anna uncovered it . so this becomes the filmmaker's triumph , as she never flags in her tone or commitment . her on camera revelations lead her audience to learn from the mistakes of others given such a litany of reasonable doubt , fbi documents and khouri's most shocking initial crime . anna broinowski watch list her now is even clever enough to use the one artistic device key players cross commenting on footage to kill two birds making her audiences want to drink from the same well again . in fact , despite her deceptively demure approach , she made me re confirm that overington and knox really did win their 2004 walkleys in investigate journalism for their norma khouri investigation . broinowski made me look . 10 10
2			homicide	good	department	bad	personalities	different	department	good			i became a fan of the tv series `homicide life on the street late in the show's run , but became a fan very quickly . it was a cop show unlike any other visually different in its use of hand held cameras , taking the viewer everywhere , with its multiethnic and mutiracial cast and their varying and fascinating personalities , and that it covered all of the good and bad of a police department , including the corruption and personality clashes that bubble up to the surface . homicide the movie , the reunion follow up to the series , is as good as a made for television film can be . after lt . giardello yaphet kotto , now a candidate for mayor of baltimore , is shot , the series cast members are back to help find the killer . in addition , the cast members who left the force and those who died , also manage to have their place in the film . the intensity and fire that marked the series return , and the script bristles with the same fire that marked the series . all in all , a terrific tv movie . vote 9
2			film	frightening	heston	great	heat	due	theme	good	pieces	atmospheric	resources	natural	heat	unbearable			truly amazing film , the concept as a possible prophetic vision of the future is frightening . a world vastly overpopulated , unbearable heat due to the damaged ozone layer , and all our natural resources spent . in this nightmarish degenerate society we have the great charlton heston as a likable film noirish style detective trying to fathom the truth behind a murder , opposite the film noir legend edward g robinson turning in a fine last performance . one of the images that will always stay with me from this film , is the masses of people that populate the stairwells and the way in which thorne heston has to hop through them every time he uses them . the movie's use of music is note worthy too , although it contains no score in the usual sense , the opening theme is good , and the subsequent snatches of music we here in simonson's apartment , and especially the beethoven pieces in the euthanasia clinic are outstandingly atmospheric .

2			movie	magical	scale	grand	minute	rich	adventure	grand	adventure	magical			hayao miyazaki has no equal when it comes to using hand drawn animation as a form of storytelling , yet often he is being compared to walt disney . that is just so unfair , because it becomes apparent by watching miyazaki's films that he is the superior arti st he really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children , and laputa is indeed one awesome ride . but where can i begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking ! miyazaki's works have never cease to amaze me . laputa is an adventure of a grand scale and i wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination . ask yourself this question if you are a kid dreaming of an adventure so grand in scope and so magical , what would it be like ? the answer would be to strap yourself in some seat and watch laputa , because it's truly a childhood fantasy come true . every minute of the movie is rich and engrossing . from the train chase to the amazing air flying sequences . and to the wonderous sight of the floating castle itself . not to mention the excellent score by joe hisaishi ! everything you ever possibly want from an adventure movie is here .
2			production	expensive	it	hard	jobs	best	production	marvelous	performances	natural	experiences	great	torrence	superb	artist	creative	heroine	little	career	entire	hero	likable			mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role . well said ! she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced , she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title ca rd needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning . indeed , in my opinion , the movie itself rates as one the all time great experiences of silent cinema . true , director john robertson doesn not move his camera an inch from start to finish , but in robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn not matter but is probably more effective . a creative artist of the first rank , robertson is a master of pace , camera angles and montage . he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players . jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive , it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian ; while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career . true , it's probably not the way mrs white intended , but it serves the plot admirably , as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother in law ! needless to say , this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug , middle class christianity . notice how the well washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption , but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer . this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented . tess also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress , gloria hope , whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema . she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children . lloyd hughes died in 1958 but she lived until 1976 easily contactable in pasadena , but i bet no one had the brains to interview her . another opportunity lost ! to me , forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner . i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this he usually played priests or judges ! but david torrence as usual was superb . in all , an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values .
2			movie	good	ms	modern	woman	young	film	best no	carter	superb	paintings	old			i suppose this is not the best film ever made but i voted it at 10 stars all the same . mainly because of my feelings at the end . i and all the people around me were simply touched . this is something you don not often feel . we are all getting a bit cynical and fed up with over sentimentality , lazy manipulation or preaching in modern fil ms the story of the film centres around jane a young woman in the last stages of mnd and the friendship that grows between her and richard , a man on the verge of a breakdown . this could have so easily been a dull and worthy piece but it is so humorous , humane and lacking in sentimentality that it wins you over completely and against the odds is a feel good movie . the acting from branagh and bonham carter is superb especially the latter who is always believable and strong in her role . the chemistry between the two also lifts the movie . the title comes from richards masterpiece , a plane made of junk and his old paintings . flying here is a symbol for both richards and janes living life to the full so that one can carry on and the other can face the end . a beautiful and funny movie that i would recommend to anyone . don not let the subject matter put you off .

2			it	good	she	excellent	films	best	cumming	superb	northam	gorgeous	cast	outstanding	bates	hysterical			this is one of the best films i have seen in years ! i am not a gwyneth paltrow fan , but she is excellent as emma woodhouse . alan cumming is superb as reverand elton , and emma thompson's sister , sophie , is hysterical as miss bates . and check out the gorgeous jeremy northam as mr knightley ; what a gentleman ! whoever said you need sex and violence in a movie to make it good has never seen emma . i think that is what separates it from so many others it's classy . if you are looking for a film that you can watch with the whole family , or looking for a romance for yourself , look no further . emma is that movie . with a beautiful setting , wonderful costumes , and an outstanding cast have i mentioned the gorgeous jeremy northam ? emma is a perfect ten !
2			film	great	looked	old	bit	old	girlish	little	film	little	scene	disturbing	boy	young			i saw this jolly little film at age 10 11 in 1979 when it was broadcast on cbs . i didn not know it had been in a theater at all . to rate it from a kids point of view i would give it 4 out of 5 stars , because being a young boy at the time , it seemed a little girlish . the climactic scene where gazooks tickles the daylights out of everyone was a bit disturbing at the time but you outgrow that sort of thing . when i re discovered it a blockbuster video in 1995 i had to revisit it ! i still liked it despite the fact that it looked a bit old . i don not know where the other reviewer on here got the idea that it wasn not on vhs . it's out there . might even be on dvd by now , at least i hope it is . i want to share it with my kids someday ! 10 stars on here , it's still a great kids film . end 09 08 2009 finally found a vhs copy ! woo hoo !
2			shows	similar	chemistry	incredible	mistake	big			the only show i have watched since 90210 why did they discontinue it ? it was the only show that captured the essence of hawaii and made you feel like you are a part of it all ! the least they should do is release it on dvd ! i checked out similar shows , but nothing has come close . the cast had incredible chemistry and i looked forward to each episode with much anticipation . they made a big mistake by pulling that show . if anyone has any info regarding where i can obtain a dvd of north shore please post a few lines here . thanks ! aloha !
2			girlfriends	best	feel	alive	place	different	gift	greatest	maze	new	bodies	young	silhouettes	new	it	awful	thing	real	country	foreign	voices	real	life	daily	mind	young	math	modern	friendship	real			`our song gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha , maria and joycelyn best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer . adolescent summer even if we don not know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain , crown heights , brooklyn is / was the same for us all . a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school . welcome heat and idleness . but if this experience of adolescence is universal , the inner city of the 90 is a different place than most of us know maybe as foreign a country as any . young bodies carving new silhouettes . beckoning new maze towards adulthood . the young mind coming into itself , speaking for itself , saying this is who i am , this is who i want to try to be . it is / was always thus . but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90 . jim mckay is the writer / director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him . the opening title slide `a film by seems to list everyone in the universe . it's a gesture but by the end of the film , we know it to be a genuine one . the closing titles also have some of the most on the money and appreciative credits i have read . the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted . mckay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story it's his three graces lanisha , maria and joycelyn . they are the real thing , their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality . this ain not no music video shorthand telling of teenage life . it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare . hanging out with them , we don not quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in . these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life . we are witness to the modern math of teenage life how its problems are interpreted , calculated and summed and solved . small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout . lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job it's the only way she gets to spend time with him . we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood . in a connected scene , lanisha defends her dad to her mom , and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return . later , the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams and we remember how crazy / funny kids are and more tragically , how realism hammers idealism these days . and at the end , maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself . we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay . she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable . `our song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship how , one day , alive and enlivening , that intimacy can , in the next , just turn and drift away . it's awful , but that's just the way it is , isn not it ?
2			gere	good	drama	solid	flock	interesting	scenery	similar	worker	social			the flock is unjustly maligned as a lesser se 7 n ripoff . there's really no reason to compare the two , except maybe for the similar scenery in the final showdown . now that that's out of the way i will go into why the flock is very interesting in some respects . mostly it's a drama piece rather than a full blown thriller about a very vigilant social worker who monitors sexual offenders . at the very beginning you can clearly see his work has got the better of him . evident in two scenes where first he's interviewing an offender and slaps him around and second when a woman tries to pick him up and all he can think of are his standard questions from his questionnaire . gere is very good as errol babbage , the aforementioned social worker . his way of performing his job is not unlike that of a police officer , he carries a gun and is constantly checking newspapers and supplies law officials with information if some of his flock may be responsible for a sexual crime . he's also a person who's lost all happiness of living and his only relief seems to come from exacting his own vigilante justice on his flock . twice you see him smile , once when he's apologizing for treating his partner rudely and the other after he's beaten up a member of his flock . as a suspense flick , the flock isn not as successful . somewhat confusing and with some irritating plot holes but it does have a number of striking set pieces . overall the flock is a solid drama about a man performing a dehumanizing job and in the end he has to work hard to keep from being swallowed by the abyss he's surrounded himself in . the world we live in is a pretty sick place and the further one can distance himself from the worst the happier that person is . the flock gets that point across nicely .
2			bulls	mechanical	stars	big	roles	big	movie	bad			what an overlooked 80 s soundtrack . i imagine john travolta sang some of the songs but in watching the movie it did seem to personify everything that was 80 cheese . clearly movies that rely on mechanical bulls , bartenders and immature relationships were in style . the best was his lousy texas accent . compare that to friday night lights . i suggest watching cocktail and stir crazy to start really getting into the dumbing down of film . also , as a side note made in america with ted danson and whoopie goldberg is an awesomely bad movie . i was so shocked to realize i had never watched it . one more weird movie of this genre would have to include cadilac man with robin willia ms just remember all of these big stars played big roles in these cheesy movies . tom cruise , richard pryor , robin williams and john travolta
2			partner	dead	businessman	haunted	shortcoming	biggest	scott	incredible	acting	wonderful	performances	excellent	version	best	manner	realistic	tale	classic	tale	important	version	good			so this made for tv film scores only a 7.6 on this site ? bah ! humbug ! without question this 1984 version of dickens classic tale is the best ever made . and yes , the hound has seen the 1951 version which was also good , but not good enough . the lack of color is perhaps the biggest shortcoming of that version , although the acting was wonderful . george scott is simply incredible as ebenezer scrooge . we all know the story of this stingy businessman who is haunted by the ghost of his dead partner , then by three other spirits later on that evening . scott is properly gruff as scrooge . too gruff in fact for some critics who claim he is unable to project the new found glee that he awakens to on christmas morning after the spirits teach him a valuable lesson . but hey , this is george scott . he's never going to go dancing down the street in a fit of joy . he has too much dignity , and his scrooge projects his emotion in a realistic manner . the supporting performances are uniformly excellent , as are the costumes , music , and scenery . 19 h century london comes to life in clive donner's visionary style . the film even borders on frightening in several scenes involving the spirits . the important tale of morality shines through in every frame , though . you won not often find this version aired on television anymore , and that is a disappointment . the 1984 version of a christmas carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday . when the decorations come out of the basement , this film should find its way into the dvd player at least once during the season . 10 of 10 stars . the hound .
2			experience	incredible	tale	little	movie	scary	creature	unstoppable	world	modern	subtext	social			first off , i hadn not seen the blob since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience . pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today . and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50 fear of teenagers . but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be . sure , it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world . but the blob packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don not believe them . in fact , there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy colored world . and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him . to sum up , if you can take off your postmodern irony filter , there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye .
2			documentary	fantastic	landscapes	remarkable	documentary	powerful			fantastic documentary of 1924 this early 20 h century geography of today's iraq was powerful . watch this and tell me if cecil demille didn not take notes before making his the ten commandments . merian cooper , the photographer , later created cinerama , an idea that probably hatched while filming the remarkable landscapes in this film . fans of werner herzog will find this film to be a treasure , with heartbreaking tales of struggle , complimented by the land around them , never has the human capacity to endure been so evident . the fact that this was made when it was shows not only the will of the subjects , but of the filmmakers themselves .
2			it	nice	fact	great	way	great	bye	good	beginning	new	it	fantastic	it	sad	ending	great	switch	great			this is a great ending to the show . the fact that adm . janeway was able to do a double switch on the borg was great . the fact that she allowed herself to be infected , thus infecting the queen with a poison that in , essence , ended the borg was great . the way they ended it also left some , not a lot , for a reunion movie . however , they did bring them home and the way they did it was fantastic ! it was sad to say good bye to a part of my family . ending it with tom and b lanna having their baby just as they enter the alpha quad . was a great way to show a new beginning . it would be nice to have a reunion movie of some type just to see where their characters would be today .
2			movie	romantic	surprise	happy	surprise	good			i went into this movie after having read it was a drama about a man with a supernatural gift , who was made into a monster by society . suffice to say i was expecting something entirely different from what i got . but it was a happy surprise . my friend and i both thought the movie was very romantic the fact that the male lead isn not bad to look at surely helped , and there was enough plot development , action and even humor the fact that it takes them until the 3 d part of the movie to now each other's name had the whole movietheatre laughing to keep you entertained and invested in the story . so in short not what i expected , but a very good surprise indeed . i will definitely buy this movie when it comes out on dvd .
2			worlds	various	world	gorgeous	thing	good	world	new	shows	different	values	incredible	i	thrilled			if i had just seen the pilot of this show i would have rated it a 10 i was immediately hooked on this gorgeous new world . subsequent episodes have not completely lived up to the promise , but i will keep watching and hope that it keeps getting better . the production values are incredible and the acting is first rate . i don not mind that it doesn not seem to align perfectly with bsg because i am so intrigued by the premise and let's face it , they are two different shows . i m thrilled that both esai morales and one of my all time faves , eric stoltz , are back in my life if only weekly as i have missed them both . this is a show that requires a bit of thought from its audience and that is always a good thing . you kind of have to wrap your head around certain aspects of the show ; things are not always as they seem and certainly there are shades of gray , both literally and figuratively , in plot lines , characters and , of course , the various virtual worlds . we all know how it ends , but the journey is looking to be quite a ride .
2			movie	enjoyable			i saw this film on television and fascinated by the beauty of jennifer mccomb . it was a neat film and you can watch it for the beauty of africa and of course mccomb . at that time i was thrilled watching this movie and from then onwards i am trying for vcd of this film but i am unable to find it . huge african lions makes appearance int his film and we will be spell bounded simply by the size of those animals and grace of them . all section of audience can watch this movie particularly children will enjoy this film . but some scenes involving mccomb forces parental guidance for this film . it is a enjoyable holiday movie for one and all .
2			movie	good	movie	different	piece	nice	film	famous	crime	real	families	rich	goer	average	women	young	people	rich	issues	social	women	happy no	she	beautiful	performance	good	folks	rich			this is yet another tell it as it is madhur bhandarkar film . i am not sure why he has this obsession to show child moles ion and g y concepts to the indian filmy audience , but i find some of those scenes really disgusting ! what's new ? it is a nice piece put together by bhandarkar , where he shows the story of an entertainment reporter played by leading lady in the famous film , mr & mrs iyer . what makes this movie different is , that it also covers the stories of people that this reporter interacts with or is friends with , such as her roomies , her colleagues , film stars , models , rich people and others featured in the entertainment page 3 in her newspaper . noticeable it is another good performance from mrs iyer . she is likely to be noticed for this role . she does selective roles but shines in them . she is noticeably de glamorized and less beautiful in this film . but then , entertainment reporters are not supposed to outshine the people they cover , right ? verdict madhur has come up with another good movie , that brings social issues to the limelight very nicely . however , this movie loses focus and one is not sure what the director is trying to convey . is he trying to show us the glitz and glamor of the rich people ? or is he trying to show us the life of an entertainment reporter and contrasting that with the life of the real crime reporter ? is he trying to tell us how the government and rich folks rule the press ? or is he trying to illustrate the issues with child abuse and g y folk . the other concepts brought forth include the unwritten rule that young women have to sleep with directors or co stars , if they wish to enter bollywood . in addition , he talks about how flight assistants get sick and tired of their jobs after a while and resort to extreme measures by marrying much elder people , etc he also talks about unhappy women and spoilt kids in rich families . this was all okay for me . but might be too complex for an average movie goer , who just wants to relieve some stress from day to day work
2			movie	good	plot	bad	attempt	pathetic	acting	terrible	film	realistic	feel	sorry	i	wrong	title	pathetic	film	good	thing	worst	you	disappointed	surprise	big			i was really excited about seeing this film . i thought finally australia had made a good film . but i was wrong . this was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever . i feel sorry for molly ringwald having to come all the way to australia to make an awful movie . the acting was terrible especially that australian guy who was trying to speak in an american accent , and the plot was also pretty bad . when i first heard about this film coming out , i thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film stab in scream 2 , but i was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie . warning ! ! major spoilers ! ! probably the worst thing about the film was the ending . i was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was . but the killer wasn not even human . which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie . don not see this film . you will probably be disappointed !
2			elephant	good	flair	dramatic	strength	dramatic	seems	superficial	philipps	busy	christensen	young	style	solid	movie	great			home room deals with a columbine like high school shooting but rather than hashing over the occurrence itself the film portrays the aftermath and what happened to the survivors , their trauma , guilt and denial . spoilers the shooting itself is treated as a foregone conclusion , with no action footage other than the reaction of an almost teenage swat commando after shooting the high school killer . the film has three protagonists ; the detective investigating the crime of which no guilty parties are left to convict and two teenage girls surviving the incident , played by a very young erika christensen and busy philipps . the two girls having nothing in common besides the shooting are put together because of it and the drama ensues . erika christensen , though only 24 has been around the block so much that film viewers are pretty much acquainted with her solid and reliable style of acting . busy philipps , three years older than christensen and altogether unknown to me , blew me away with her overwhelming dramatic strength and screen presence . this girl was the part . it's a great movie and it connects to you with its intimate focus on the fragile yet growing relationship between the two traumatized girls . gus van sant's elephant 2003 though good , seems almost superficial and paltry compared to home room when it comes to dramatic flair and acting . what i can see this film got very little screen time and exposure so much more a loss for an equally traumatized america . ten out of ten
2			comedies	romantic	fx	special	you	bored	plot	predictable	evening	quiet			i recently bought this movie with a bunch of other laserdiscs from ebay . usually , i am into war and action movies but occasionally i enjoy romantic comedies . if you are bored by today's special fx films and high gloss romantic comedies you should check out shop around the corner on a quiet evening . what i like about the movie is that the characters have a lot of decency . there is nothing fake or pretentious about them . take mr matuschek for example when he finds out that his wife is cheating on him with one of his own employees he tries to shot himself . not just because of the humiliation but because he has been unjust to the character of stewart . ok , weired example . yes , the focus of the movie is narrow and the plot is predictable . yet still , i liked it a lot . if you likes notting hill then you will like shop around the corner . in fact , hugh grant reminds me a lot of jimmy stewart .
2			she	jealous	films	french	girl	old	movies	french			garde vue has to be seen a number of times in order to understand the sub plots it contains . if you are not used to french wordy films , based upon conversation and battle of wits rather than on action , don not even try to watch it . you will only obtain boredom to death , and reassured opinion that french movies are not for you . garde vue is a wordy film , essentially based upon dialogs written by audiard by the way and it cruelly cuts the veil of appearances . why does matre martineau serrault prefer to be unduly accused of being a child murderer rather than telling the truth ? because at the time of the murder he was with a 18 years old girl with which he has a 8 years sexual relation . his wife knows it , she's jealous of it and he prefers to be executed in 1980 in france , there was still death penalty rather than unveiling the sole pure and innocent aspect of his pitiful life .
2			thing	entire	i	glad			i can not see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm , when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly about . this is a fun movie . my children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it . granted , the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher , but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark , gloomy , and very morbid pokemon 3 my children have been watching pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put off the childish things and move on to others . i am glad that we got to enjoy this together .
2			film	compelling	he	vicious	expert	experienced no	he	ashamed	chikatilo	russian	he	disgusted	movies	best	superior	cynical	it	disturbing			this has to be one the best movies about serial killers that i have ever seen , and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved silence of the lambs . hbo has hit the jackpot here . this film is compelling from the first moment until the la st this film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about . it chronicles the decade long search for the russian serial killer andrea chikatilo . stephen rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation , and donald sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior , and the only person in the russian government willing to help him . both of their performances are subtle masterpieces rea begins naive and unwilling to compromise , while sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation . towards the end , rea becomes more world weary and beaten by the system , while sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic . in any other movie , i would have said that sutherland's performance stands out above the rest , but here even it is rivaled by jeffrey dumann , as the serial killer himself . dumann brilliantly creates a character here who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find he is a monster , but he doesn not want to be , and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are . he is tortured , ashamed , but vicious as well . if you can take the incredibly dark subject matter , and it is very disturbing , then you should see this movie .
2			movies	great	man	old	inian	young	west	old	dialogue	great	screen	big	look	realistic			like most other reviewers i have first seen this movie on tv , never on the big screen , when i was a teenager . my dad has always regarded this film highly and recommended it to me then , and i must say he was not only right , but this movie has stayed with me forever in the more than 2 decades since i saw it first time . i have seen it two or three more times since then just a few days ago i gave it another watch and it has not lost anything of its impact with time . it still a great and well worth to be seen movie ! manr regard peckinpah's ride the high country as one of the first and best later western , which had a realistic look at life in the old west , but the hardly known last hunt is definitely the better movie and was even half a dozen years earlier . actually it was probably 3 decades ahead of its time , or maybe it still is . although thinking hard and having certainly seen 100 of western i like this genre i can not remember any western as bleak and depressive as this one . two men bound together , partly by hate , partly by not seeming to have other choices , surrounded by beautiful ms padget , a crippled old man and a young inian , leading the life of buffalo killers until fate reaches out for one of them . nobody who has ever seen this movie will be able to forget its ending and the last frames of this gem . when the camera moves on and away from mr taylor a white buffalo skin comes into sight on a tree and echos from the past , when all the hatred began , are present again . mr taylor has got his buffalo , but in the end the buffalo got him . aside from the top performances of everybody involved , the intelligent script and the great dialogue , it should also be mentioned , that the last hunt is superbly photograped , i have seldomely seen a western that well shot aside from the ones directed by anthony mann , which are also all superbly photographed , that all the locations are cleverly chosen and that even the soundtrack fits the picture very well . and director brooks is really a superb storyteller . master craftsmanship ! he has made quite a couple of really great movies and was successful in nearly every imaginable genre , but even in an as prolific career as this one , the last hunt still shines as one of his best , if not his be st definitely would deserve a higher rating , compared to the 7 something ride the high country enjoys .
2			atmosphere	graphic	i	impressed			i watched this movie with some curiosity . i wanted to see if 1 paul muni could play chinese and 2 luise rainer deserved her oscar . i came away from the film thinking yes ! having seen muni in only one film where he was quite hammy , i expected the same type of performance here . i was happily proved wrong . although some might criticize him as being too childlike and stereotypically simple in the hollywood idea of asians , i thought he was just right in the role . keye luke , if he would been given the chance to play a lead role , might have played him in much the same manner . i was particularly impressed by the camera work and the use of crowd scenes , especially during the sacking of the palace where o lan was once a slave . the graphic and grim atmosphere of the firing squad and the drought made this an epic quite unlike others of the same time where it was all glitz and glitter . i watched this film from beginning to end enthralled . i can not say the same for the epics of today .

2			haze	legendary	work	best	skits	various			ok , needless to say , this film is only going to appeal to a certain audience ; namely stoners and like minded people . that being said , if you are one of these aformentioned people , this film is a mu st in fact , i think it should be mandatory for head shops to sell a copy of it to anyone purchasing their first bong . what monty python's holy grail is to geeks and nerds , so is this movie to potheads . i first saw this film 10 years ago or so , and i still crack up every time i watch it . the jokes perfectly lampoon the pothead lifestyle , far better than latter day knockoffs like half baked attempt to . there isn not a plot , so to speak ; the film is more of a collection of various skits ; as the films protagonists wander around los angeles in their legendary haze . despite this , the film has an excellent sense of pace , and doesn not drag at all . many people cite up in smoke as c&c's best work , but i would have to say that next movie is superior . so if you are in the mood for an hour and half of belly laughs , light up , tune in , and let your mind float away oh , and free tommy chong !
2			movie	best	line	best			this was the best movie i have ever seen about bulimia . it hit the exact spot of what bulimia is really about and how it's not always about being skinny and dieting . it showed how people with bulimia tend to think about things such as their outlook on life , friends and themselves . the best line and the part that really shows what the problem with bulimia is , is when beth says , it's not about you ! that line really showed a lot about the character and others with the same problem . it showed that people with bulimia don not have this problem because of anything that has to do with anyone else . it has to do with them and them only . it shows that it's time to talk about the person with the problem instead of putting the attention all on themselves . it showed that beth needed to call out for attention at that moment and she needed her mom's attention at that time the mo st

the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife . as a result , the duchess attempted to limit victoria's contact with the king . in an over the top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history , the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet , stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18 h birthday so that her mother would not become regent . king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne . victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy , whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable . they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother . not he young victoria conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victoria's coronation as queen . a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne , the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was . in the beginning melbourne gains the young queen's trust and they become good friends . in the early years of her reign , she sees melbourne as a progressive , but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician , hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing . in reality , melbourne was more a father figure to victoria , but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert , as though they were romantic rivals . the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel , of the more conservative tory party , as the new prime minister . the film chronicles the events of not he bedchamber crisis in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians . the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings , one of the duchess's ladies in waiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him . because of her hatred for conroy , victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings alleged pregnancy . as it turned out , hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor . victoria's inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affair . the rest of the not he young victoria deals with of course the romance between the queen and prince albert . victoria kept albert waiting , as the film makes clear , since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign . they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisis . i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip , the current queen's husband . while philip is mainly danish , he went to school in germany and had in laws who were of german background . both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court there's a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years ! albert's struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs , they had to find something to do . both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn not have to live continually in the shadow of their ever popular wives . fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his interference in her affairs . albert doesn not want a second bedchamber crisis so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving victoria's bedchamber ladies . victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened ! the performances in the film are uniformly excellent , especially the principals , emily blunt and rupert friend . the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography no mention of victoria's depression after albert's death . but victoria is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson .

2			beginning	great	ending	emotional	middle	fine	films	open no	taste	good			though structured totally different from the book by tim krabb who wrote the original not he vanishing spoorloos it does have the same overall feel , except for that koolhoven's style is less business like and more lyric . the beginning is great , the middle is fine , but the sting is in the end . a surprise emotional ending . as you could read in several magazines there is some sex in the film , but it is done all very beautifully . never explicit , but with lots of warmth and sometimes even humour . it is a shame american films can not be as open an honoust as this one . where dutch films tend to go just over the edge when it comes to this subject , would e grot stays always within the boundaries of good taste . would e grot tells an amazing story stretched over more than 30 years . when you will leave the cinema you will be moved . what can we ask more of a film ? anyway , this film even gives more .

2			cinematography	great	they	different	saga	religious	woman	rich	woman	beautiful			director paul verhoeven's american vehicles are of varied quality , but most of the films he made in his native country are indisputable masterworks . this is the story of alcoholic and bi sexual writer who moves in with a beautiful rich and very strange woman . but the lady does not know that he is only interested in meeting the woman's handsome male lover . in the meantime , the writer is plagued with strange visions at first they look like hallucinations triggered by alcohol abuse , but he soon begins to realize that he is actually experiencing some kind of premonitions . fascinating hitchcockian thriller , very original and provocative . i love films that make you think they are about something , but then you realize they are about something completely different . this is one of those movies ; a thriller during the first half , and a quasi religious surrealist saga during the second half . very erotic , original and blasphemous , not for kids or people that go to church every sunday . great cinematography by future director jan de bont . highly reommended !
2			performance	great	footage	new	anything	wrong no	footage	old	thirds	interesting			the first two thirds of this biopic of fetish model betty page are very interesting . betty , as portrayed with enormous sincerity by gretchen mol , comes across as a pleasant , girl next door type , who saw nothing wrong with what she did and there certainly wasn not anything wrong with it . director mary harron , who also made i shot andy warhol and american psycho , recreates betty's america by mixing old black and white stock footage with new , degraded , black and white footage . once betty lands in florida and starts working with bunny yeager , color is introduced . betty's notoriety was mostly the result of her work with paula and irving klaw lili taylor , in a great performance , and chris bauer , as well as john willie jared harris . the scenes where harron recreates betty's bondage photography sessions are fascinating and adroitly executed . the early purveyors of fetish material are not portrayed too condescendingly and we get a sense that these folks were part of a tight community . betty never had too much of a problem with her notoriety , although we get the impression that her reputation prevented her from gaining legitimacy in the straight acting world . because the film's third act is virtually non existent , we are left with the impression that we have been watching a feature length documentary on betty page rather than a structured drama . flaws aside , it's a film well worth catching and represents yet another fine feather in the cap of producer christine vachon .

2			acting	fine	plot	simple	film	great	father	dead	it	creepy			well , after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on bravo's the 100 scariest movie moments i had long awaited to see this film . the plot was simple , beautiful model alison parker cristina raines moves into an apartment building that's a gateway to hell . the sentinel is a down right creepy film , even if it's a bit slow . it's a mix of the omen and rosemary's baby . the acting is fine , and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing the ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals . it's a very odd , campy but in the end , i truly believe a great film ! one of my favorites from the 70 s , even if it's nothing greatly original . it's wacky and extremely creepy ! probably one of my all time favorites . 9 10
2			situations	social	life	cultural	headlines	stupid	situation	social	film	good			good film . tells a boyish fantasy story , telling us how trapped we are in social situations and what kind of extreme measures one has to take to behave differently . or at least the feeling that you have to break every rule if you are to break one . if you wanted to express love for someone you don not know , how would you do it without creating a pressing social situation ? also it's about the fascism of deciding over others cultural life , of what kind of culture that is jammed down our throats . what gives disney or fox or the suicide bomber the right to decide what is our choice . are one not allowed to drink the morning coffee by one self . do we have to listen to the nrj shouting , see the stupid tabloid headlines and the street commercials before we even have had our morning coffee ?
2			way	hilarious	movie	perfect	players	professional			this is the only full length feature film about the world of bridge . i found the first 10 minutes a bit slow , but after that , the movie is absolutely perfect in describing professional bridge players and how they go about earning a living . some of the scenes are very funny . i don not think that a non bridge player would get the charm of this movie . some of the dresses are really beautiful , pity the movie is in black and white i can only imagine what they would look like in color . the way the media are portrayed is absolutely hilarious . there is no way on earth bridge will ever be like that . watch it as soon as you can , and tell your friends about it .

2			sequences	original	features	special	production	big	sequences	imaginative	people	real	it	funny	problems	emotional	sex	gratuitous	people	realistic no			this is one of the funniest movies i have seen . i watched it on dvd , and the disc does not have any special features , or even a menu , but that is not necessarily what i care about . i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis , depending on , among other things , if it is a big studio production or a smaller film . this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things . that said , i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen . i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players . i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin . alan arkin has most of the funniest lines . the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people , but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does . that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor . this is not a movie for children , obviously , but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity . there is quite a bit of adult language , though , but it can sometimes be very funny . in particular , alan arkin's character , who can not even swear correctly . also watch for the cameos from known character actors .
2			face	familiar	darren	nice	story	different	role	similar	role	various			while movie titles contains the word mother , the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children . however , the mother tells a different story . the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child , or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child . here , notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her . before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond , here , he plays darren , a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother , and sleeping with her daughter as well . anne reid , who was a familiar face on tv series , takes up the challenging role of the leading character , may . the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband , toots , in a family visit to her son , bobby . while she befriends darren , a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby's house , she was shocked to found out that her daughter , paula , was sleeping with darren . at the same time , may was coping with life after the death of toots . fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her , may starts to find her life going off track , until she spends her afternoon with darren . darren was nice and friendly to may , and may soon finds some affection on darren . instead of treating him like a friend , she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple . later , may found sexual pleasure from darren , where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else . and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family . the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life , and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on . this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her , where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for . anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may , as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series . as she do not have much movies in her career resume , the mother has put her on the critic's attention . daniel craig , on the other hand , had took on a similar role in his movie career , such as sylvia 2003 and enduring love 2004 . if his reprising role of james bond fails , film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career , and the mother is one of them . the mother may not be everyone's favorite , but it is definitely not your usual matine show to go along with tea and scones , accompanied by butter and jam .

2			zones	various	zones	climatic	warming	global	film	solid	sharks	great	shots	aerial	speed	incredible	moments	dramatic	moments	humorous	screen	big	quickness	great	choice	solid			in celebration of earth day disney has released the film earth . stopping far short of any strident message of gloom and doom , we are treated to some excellent footage of animals in their habitats without feeling too bad about ourselves . the stars of the show are a herd of elephants , a family of polar bears and a whale and its calf . the narrative begins at the north pole and proceeds south until we reach the tropics , all the while being introduced to denizens of the various climatic zones traversed . global warming is mentioned in while we view the wanderings of polar bear ; note is made of the shrinking sea ice islands in more recent years . we never see the bears catch any seals , but the father's desperate search for food leads him to a dangerous solution . the aerial shots of caribou migrating across the tundra is one of the most spectacular wildlife shots i ever saw ; it and another of migrating wildfowl are enough to reward the price of admission to see them on the big screen . one of the disappointments i felt was that otherwise terrific shots of great white sharks taking seals were filmed in slow motion . never do you get the sense of one characteristic of wild animals ; their incredible speed . the idea of slowing down the film to convey great quickness i think began with or at least it's the first i recall seeing the television show kung fu during the early seventies . an interesting sidelight is that as the credits roll during the end some demonstrations of the cinematographic techniques employed are revealed . there are enough dramatic , humorous and instructive moments in this movie to make it a solid choice for nature buffs . perhaps because of some selective editing sparing us , as it were , from the grisly end of a prey predator moment and the fact that this footage had been released in 2007 and is available on dvd it is a solid film in its own right . and you can take your kids ! three stars .
2			dreyfuss	exceptional	laughs	good	art	great	work	good	actors	good	cameos	little	angst	existential	script	humorous	shtick	great			as a community theater actor who works hard at it but doesn not take acting too seriously , i m always amused by those who treat it as great art . this movie skewers the actor's craft mercilessly while dishing up a lot of good laughs . a ham actor on location for a movie bears a resemblance to the dictator . when the dictator dies of a heart attack from too much drink and food , the actor is kidnapped and forced to play the part of a lifetime by the neo nazi head of the secret service . he plays it to the hilt , gets the dictator's girlfriend to fall in love with him and vice versa , and turns the tables on his captors beautifully . lots of great shtick by the leads , lots of good work by some unknown supporting actors , particularly the household staff and two members of the palace guard , and fun little cameos abound . sammy davis jr makes light of himself , jonathan winters plays a semi retired american businessman with something else going on , and raul julia , sonia braga , and above all richard dreyfuss are exceptional . this is a dumb movie , but it has lots of beautiful locations in brazil , a humorous script , and good actors doing their thing and looking like they are actually having fun and not going through the usual existential angst about what is only play acting !

2			count	low	director	gay	it	hard	plot	great	plot	compelling	it	true	roles	serious			when it comes to movies i can be pretty picky , and i will complain about anything and everything that is done wrong . while every movie has its flaws , the night listener had an exceptionally low count . if you read the last review it was hard , since half of it was written in caps and it contained no actual information about the movie , you may have been led to believe that this movie was not too well done . unfortunately , if you read more than 3 lines into that same review , you discovered the poster's reason for disdain he / she does not like the fact that the director is gay or that the production team smokes crack . apparently . so , despite the fact that i have never written a review before , i thought this movie deserved one based on its merits , not the sexual orientation of its director . let's go over a quick checklist first 1 great plot ? absolutely . i won not give a shred of it away , but the plot is highly compelling and definitely not what one would expect based on the commercials . this is a thriller , not a horror , and it should be approached as such . the story really will amaze you , even more so because it's true and the plot did stay quite faithful to the actual events . 2 wonderful acting ? oh yes . robin williams long ago broke free from the chains of the comedy type cast , and he has since flourished in serious roles for which many people would have wrote him off just a decade ago . he once again achieves high form in his role in the night listener , playing a radio host who becomes increasingly troubled by and entangled in a case , i will let you see for yourself . 3 excellent direction ? certainly . now , unlike the other poster to which i referred , i actually know something about direction . i have been sutdying the art of direction at school now for 3 years . of course i really don not think that makes a lick of difference the only thing that matters is if you like the direction , but i thought i should simply establish once again that i m basing my opinions here on something both substantial and example not the sexual orientation of the director or the alleged drug habits of the production team , lol . patrick stettner's direction was moody and dark , and he allowed the angles and lighting to help create those so sought after feelings of tension and release rather than the messy , fast paced camera work and quick cuts we are so often subjected to today . some people can truly show you a story through their camera , while other's feel as if they have to make the story with the camera . i really appreciate when someone these days has the courage to just use the camera as its supposed to be utilized , which is as an eyeball through which we all see . 4 lighting , cinematography , and editing ? great all around . i have already wrote so much , and i could go on about these last three things for another ten paragraphs , so i will just wrap it up . in short , go see this movie . don not listen to people who have alterior motives for trashing it , especially if they are so stupid that they unknowingly reveal that motive 1 4 of the way through their po st enjoy the show ! ben
2			movie	good	zhao	great	scene	priceless	they	conventional no	girl	little	work	flawless	zhu	excellent	film	best			this movie is the best film ever . i can not remember the last time a movie has drawn tears out of me . with a tear in my eye , i admire this movie . it has all the elements that a good movie must have excellent dialogues , music , acting , story / plot . a story of friendship , courage , kindliness and loyalty between a street performing who famous to the king of masks and a little girl that sold as a boy in serf bazaar . little girl liked to be his granddaughter and king of masks liked a grandson . they were not conventional in real . every scene they were together was priceless . the camera work is flawless and grips you . the acting is inspired . xu zhu was excellent as the king of masks . renying zhou doggie looks pretty and played her character very well . zhigang zhao as liang sao lang was great . he played his helpful and kindhearted character extremely well . if you have not this movie , try it once , do watch it .

2			power	natural	i	impressed			okay , truthfully , i saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself , what are the producers thinking ? hutton , jolie , and duchovny ? how could the monotoned actor possibly compete with jolie's natural power on the screen ? but surprisingly , the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss . even david's humor matched up to jolie's spark and fire . as for hutton , he played the psycho very well , contrasting with david's calm delivery of life threatening situations . overall , i was very impressed with the writing and character development . i gave it 8 stars .
2			it	subtle	effect	great	shrimp	best no	rita	gorgeous	shrimp	fresh	gun	golden			this 1947 film stars and was directed and written by orson welles with a funky irish accent and also stars the gorgeous rita hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair . so , i have hung out with orson before in touch of evil and citizen kane and the third man etc but this was my first rita hayworth interaction . our first meeting went well , she does a superb job playing the frightened / cagey elsa , married to a crippled millionaire lawyer . mike welles and elsa fall for each other . he wants to run away with her , she doesn not know if she can live without the things money can buy . elsa , her husband , and his partner bicker and bite , just like the sharks mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true . several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house . think the ending shootout in the man with the golden gun , which borrowed heavily from this scene . i wasn not sure who the murderer was until the end . this movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon . the dish centers on the sea , it is subtle , sour , and pungent , all to great effect . these might not be the best , fresh shrimp , but good quality frozen shrimp from costco . the flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy , but filling alternative to more mundane , common fare . 7 10

2			noriko	old	mission	personal	drama	serious			aim for the top ! gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it . i totally loved this series , and to this day , it remains my favorite anime . and while it was not gainax's first animated product , it was their first ova series . mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970 s sports drama aim for the ace ace o nerae ! gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 when noriko takaya is forced to relive the death of her father , who was killed in mankind's initial encounter with the insect race humanity is at war with . it is because of her father's death that noriko wants to become a combat pilot . but her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters . her friend , kazumi amano , even has doubts about noriko being chosen as a pilot . however , noriko's coach , koichiro ota , has faith in her . and he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot , for he was a survivor of the battle in which noriko's father was killed . other characters include jung freud , a russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron noriko and kazumi belong to , smith toren , a love interest for noriko who is killed in their first sortie together , and kimiko higuchi , noriko's childhood friend . kimiko's involvement is also of interest , as while noriko is off in space , kimiko remains behind on earth to live a normal life . and because of the acts of time dilation , kimiko ages normally on earth while noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school . by the end of the series , noriko is roughly 18 years old while kimiko is in her mid fifties . all in all , this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of gainax animation . if you like hideaki anno's other shows , or are a fan of haruhiko mikimoto's artwork , then give this show a chance . it will grow on you .
2			era	new	ms	visual	news	marvellous	films	necessary	control	emotional			man oh man . i have been foolishly procrastinating not the right term , there's a long list ! to watch this film and finally had the chance to do so . and news are marvellous labyrinthine spectacle ! for any von trier's follower both rigets , element of crime , dogville , dancer in the dark , the five obstructions , etc . europa is probably the differential for its greatness in visual ter ms everything is beautifully somber and claustrophobic ! you really get the feeling of being inside this imaginary nightmarish time warp . taking from the masters of surreal cinema like bunuel , bergman , till noir films of the 40 s with acidic drops of avant guard von trier leads the art film scene as the well intended totalitarian movie maker of nowadays . his authoritarian way of dealing with very intricate issues , without being irrational , hits the nerve of the viewer with the intent to cure some of the deepest wounds we feed in our hypocritical world . as utopian as it seems , i do believe people like von trier could help society in many ways in a broader aspect . the day films and filmmakers that carry this sort of power are no longer necessary , as a tool for reflection , perhaps it could be the start of a new era the age of emotional control over our fears . this is what he offers to us constantly through his work over and over . bravo !
2			dancers	best	boy	little	sinatra	awful	you	disappointed no	favorite	personal			the only reason i give this movie 8 10 stars , and not 10 is because 1 sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of kelly's character leaves much to be desired , imho . do love that dean stockwell , quantum leap al , is the little boy . the dance sequence with jerry mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences i have ever seen . tom and jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughter's . i m 28 and she's 4 so while the character is less iconic than mickey , he is still a favorite of many children and adults today . kelly is as always captivating , his eyes full of fun and excitement . in every movie i have ever seen him in , he always steals the show . one of the best dancers of the 20 h century . it is no wonder paula abdul sampled kelly's moves . i would also list gene kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20 h century . if you were to watch only one part , don not miss kelly's dance with jerry mouse . you will not be disappointed .
2			space	empty	mention	special	script	strong	performances	good	depth	emotional	depth	significant	visuals	impressive	viewers	young	design	nice	laughs	great			i watched this as part of my course at aberystwyth university and it baffles me how this does not have a distributor in the uk . well actually , it doesn not , because this film is everything a hollywood film isn not original , creative , quirky and humorous . it seems that today no one really wants to see this type of movie as , in the simplest terms , it doesn not conform to the generic conventions most young viewers look for in a film . i haven not written a review for the imdb for ages but felt inclined to give this film a special mention , even if it is during my 30 minute break between classes ! essentially , it is about nothing , as the two main characters are plunged into their own world of nothingness through a hate of the world . the brilliance here is how the director sustains interest through the majority of the run time with only two characters and when the only mise en scene consists of half a house and a vast white , empty space . this is due in large part to the stellar performances of the actors , both of whom offer some great laughs while at the same time being able to add significant emotional depth to their roles . i would love to write some more but am on quite a time limit . however i encourage anyone and everyone to give this film a try . a very unique concept is brought to the screen in a coherent and well executed fashion , with the combination of good performances , a strong script , nice sound design and fairly impressive visuals creating a very entertaining movie . it's just a shame so few people know about nothing .
2			strip	comic	film	good	i	pleased			i was pleased to see that she had black hair ! i have been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories . i was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer , it didn not spoil it at all . in fact i watched the film twice in one day , a sure sign that it was up to standa rd this is what i do with books that i like as well . i thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of modesty blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip . i would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly . has he actually read the books ? i thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation .
2			acting	professional	cinematography	beautiful	gay	foreign	leads	fantastic	acting	intense	lines	bad	nuances	little	story	complex	films	foreign	story	difficult			i m gonna give it to ya movie is amazing . foreign gay films are so fast surpassing american gay films in production quality acting and story . while so many american indie gay films are grainy , bad sound , amateur acting , trite story lines , and a surprising lack of any nudity or erotica , top quality foreign gay films have been popping up like this one from france . the cinematography is beautiful , thought out , meaningful . the story is adult and complex but not difficult for anyone to follow , the acting is intense and professional . both leads are fantastic , as well as the entire ca st the boys are more than just good looking and there's plenty of full frontal nudity . you follow the entire year of these boys , from their meeting to the end . all the little nuances of a relationship's , the details of falling in , and out , of love are there beautifully performed . it left me wanting more . check it out !
2			it	good	town	little	action	little	story	good	score	nice	look	beautiful	life	nice	girl	nice	he	famous			in a little town in montana two brothers grow up . one of them is norman craig sheffer , the other is paul brad pitt . their father is reverend maclean and they grow up with his lessons that has to do with religion , and the lessons of fly fishing . in this movie fly fishing represents life , a little . the story is good and keeps your attention although there are some moments you need a little action . probably the movie has this moments because it is not really about the events that happen , but about the message . some things do happen though . norman goes to dartmouth to study . after six years he returns and gets involved with a nice girl named jessie emily lloyd and he is invited to teach in chicago . paul has become a reporter and is known as the fishing reporter . he is famous and it seems he has a nice life , but he drinks a little too much and gambles too much . the movie is very well directed , it has a nice score and all of the actors are good . the most beautiful thing in this movie is the cinematography . the mountains , the woods and the river all look very beautiful . if the movie was only made for these things it was good enough to watch . fortunately there is more .
2			it	worth			being that this movie has a lot of fine entertainment qualities i think it should some more credit than it has been given on imdb . it's your basic who done it ? thriller with sex and murder but it keeps you guessing right to the end . i like these kinds of movies and i certainly think this one meets the standa rd to me it was worth watching more than once so i will give it an 8 on imdb .
2			things	good	school	elementary	dramas	best	logic	tremendous			one of the best movie dramas i have ever seen . we do a lot of acting in the church and this is one that can be used as a resource that highlights all the good things that actors can do in their work . i highly recommend this one , especially for those who have an interest in acting , as a must see . there are several scenes of note . for one , the graveyard scene when hamlet encounters yorick everyone knows about that scene by just going to elementary school , and his interaction with the skull was extremely well done . the logic used in this scene was tremendous i suppose a testament to shakespeare more than anything else . for a second , i very much enjoyed the scene where hamlet , horatio and the character played by robin williams discussed the upcoming duel .
2			marriage	modern	scenery	good	acting	good	actors	little	days	modern	retribution	greatest	feel	happy	areas	physical			thanks should be given to the hong kong vcd / dvd distributors that i only paid us$ 1.4 and i could have such a surprisingly delightful enjoyment . adultery ? how common in our modern days . eva grabbed her two children and kidnapped nick to chase after luis and charlotte to italy . she wants her revenge done but at the end , she also commits the same crime of luis she had sex with nick . in this small indie production , vivian naefe dealt with the teething problems in modern marriage with a light heart . how can one dare treat marriage seriously in this fast food time where people are now of higher mobility in physical , mental and technology areas ? conjugal commitment asks for too high a price that most people would choose to succumb to circumstances . nick once trusted charlotte but he fell for eva after that kidnap journey which forced him to experience much growth . most viewers may feel happy about the ending because eva and nick come together , well , this should be the greatest retribution to the unfaithful act of their spouses . however , i want a sequel , i want to see how the four would develop after this exchange . perhaps they may exchange back , how can one be so sure about the shaky love relationship . good acting and good scenery . the two little child actors should not be neglected especially the boy when he cries at the reception of the hotel in venezia . and of course , how can we forget the bella , bella scenery of the city .

2			it	good	leader	revolutionary	cops	various	animation	awesome	story	live	they	worth no	traffic	heavy	settings	southern	movie	controversial	it	worth	classic	original	it	funny	ways	various	ruby	dead	photos	live			remember ralph bakshi ? the guy that was an animator on terrytoons , then on paramount cartoon studios , after that , he was a director on fritz the cat 1 & 2 and heavy traffic ? well , this is coonskin . and it's actually pretty good . racist , but good . the movie takes place in harlem nights no , duh , it was a working title . but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie , song of the south . it's about sampson barry white and the preacherman charles gordone rush to help their friend , randy philip michael thomas escape from prison , but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police . while waiting for them , randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy scatman crothers , as he begins to tell randy a story about three guys , i used to know , just like you and your friends . pappy's story is told in animation set against live action background photos and footage . brother rabbit voice of thomas , brother bear voice of white , and preacher fox voice of gordone decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel . arriving in harlem , rabbit , bear , and fox find that it isn not all that it's made out to be . they encounter a con man named simple savior , a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the cousin of black jesus , and that he gives his followers the strength to kill whites . in a flashy stage performance in his church , savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of john wayne , elvis presley and richard nixon , before asking his parishioners for donations . rabbit first goes up against madigan , a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia , who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways , including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them he believes they are not worth it . when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs , he and his cohorts , ruby and bobby , are led to a nightclub called the cottontail . a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink . madigan , while under the influence of his spiked drink , is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man , and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype , adorned in something racist , and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead . then , while recovering from his delirium of being drugged , shoots his gun around randomly , and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them . rabbit , bear , fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up . the live action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops , but managing to make it out alive . this movie was controversial at that time of release , and was re edited by the director several times under the title , street fight , which is obvious , since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets . in fact , this movie has the same subject as the documentary . that caused bryanston pictures , the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic , texas chainsaw massacre , to go out of business . because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film , but due to racism , bryanston took over bakshi's production . despite the controversy , it was worth the entertainment . the animation was awesome at that time , the plot makes sense , and it's actually funny too . final verdict 9 10
2			reality	realistic	i	happy	ending	great	moment	anxious	episodes	dull	it	fun			the planning episodes were a bit dull , but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch . the reason why i call it the most realistic reality show is because , much to my surprise , charley fell out of the race relatively early . when his hands were sore , i expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix , but instead he actually quit the race . the most anxious moment of the show must have been when max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food ! the ending was great and i was very happy to see at least one of the team make it . overall , not as great as the long way round , but definitely an interesting watch , as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world .
2			life	different	plot	familiar	actors	good	impression	big			girlfight is using a well known formula as someone pointed out , however , i have seen plenty of movies that don not do it this well or that are not this credible . i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the movie . the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and , i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this . although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general , this is the movie that gave me the spark . so the plot is familiar / common . actors are good . but the thoughts that it can spark are what make it above average in my opinion . it made a big impression on me and i know i m not the only one .
2			movies	good			this movie had me smiling from beginning to end , partly at the humor , partly at meg ryan this is the perfect character for her , and always because it's just one of the best feel good movies i have seen . hopefully the dvd will be out soon .
2			horses	mechanical	movie	classic	frame	historical	story	dimensional	he	scared	satisfaction	tremendous	boys	young	friend	cynical	boys	imaginative			this was a favorite of my childhood i can remember seeing it on television and thrilling to it each time . now that i m grown up and have a kid of my own , i wanted to introduce him to this classic movie . we watched it last friday , and he liked it . during abu's fight with the giant spider , my son's hand crept over and took hold of mine he was genuinely scared . is he gonna beat the spider , poppa ? just watch , you will see . he has no historical frame of reference to speak of eight years old , so bagdad under the grandson of haroun al raschid might as well be oz under ozma . i think he especially liked how much of the heroics and derring do were perpetrated by the boy thief , and not the grown up king . in fact , if you deconstruct the film's narrative a bit , the king is the thief's sidekick , not the hero at all which must be very satisfying to imaginative , adventurous young boys . it's definitely a period piece i suspect that by the time he's eleven or twelve , my son will find it corny or whatever word the next generation will be using by then . the love story is barely one dimensional as a cynical friend commented , why does ahmad love the princess ? because the narrative demands it . the willingness of abu to put himself in jeopardy repeatedly for the clueless , love struck deposed king is equally improbable . but to quibble about such things while accepting flying mechanical horses , fifty foot genies and the temple of the all seeing eye would be fatuous in the extreme . the satisfaction of seeing the prophecy fulfilled at the movie's climax is tremendous , as is the final shot of abu triumphantly flying away on his stolen magic carpet , seeking some fun , and adventure at last !

2			score	finest	thrillers	best	performances	solid	width	entire			dressed to kill , is one of the best thrillers ever made . its dealings with sex and violence make this a film for adults . brian de palma , once again , proves why no other director can match his use of the camera to tell a story . he directs many scenes without dialog , and he tells much of his story , strictly through the use of his visuals , and pino donnagio's brilliant score . filmed in panavision , the film must be seen in widescreen , as de palma uses the entire width of the film to tell his story . cropped , on video , dressed to kill , is barely the same movie . solid performances from its cast , superb direction , and , perhaps , the finest film score ever written , make dressed to kill a must see .
2			event	real	age	golden	lincoln	best	lincoln	young	days	new	license	dramatic			ok , first a correction to the tag posted on this movie's main page . abe lincoln did not walk with his sister in the movie , nor did he stop at his sister's grave . the individual in question is ann rutledge who was a very close friend to lincoln in his new salem days . some say that ann was , in fact , lincoln's girlfriend , but there is no evidence to support it . now , there are fabrications and fictionalizations in this film . hollywood has always taken dramatic license with anything under the sun , and young mr lincoln is no exception . however , the courtroom case that is in the film is based on a real event the accusation of murder against william duff armstrong , and even though it's largely fictionalized in this film with lots of name changes , it will still have viewers riveted to the screen . this is hollywood's golden age , with drama at it's finest , and henry fonda gives possibly the best lincoln played by anyone .
2			references	gratuitous	performance	great	i	suck	review	flat			i suck at gratuitous boob references , so i m just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review . i love elvira , not in a i m going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way , but suffice to say i think she rocks . the movie is played like a 50 s horror film only alot more fun , look for the leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what i mean . what relay shines through in the movie is elvira's or should that be cassandras absolute charm . i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since . i realy should get around to buying a copy , the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear . if any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free . p . s another great performance from edie mcclurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves .

2			creepy	realistic			guinea pig the devil's experiment is without a doubt stars on first view , its a raw realistic creepy and disturbing look into the dark side of human nature . this movie gets right to the point , you may be thinking what point ? the point is to satisfy fan's of just extreme violence and gore . this movie has some gore , more or less just torturing a women violently . there are really only 3 scene's that could be considered gore . i will tell you one thing though guinea pig the devil's experiment makes hostile look like sesame street . if you thought hostile was a crazy brutal disturbing torture flick then you ain not seen the half of it until you have seen guinea pig the devil's experiment . movie rating 0 -5 gore 0 -10 guinea pig the devil's experiment uncut 7

2			acting	great	waltzing	new	movies	historical	history	great	dubbing	french	styles	great	type	new	skirts	awesome	victoria	fascinating	stuff	historical	movie	german			i loved this movie . it was so well done ! great acting and drama and historically accurate . i love romy schneider movies . this one rocks , not as great as sissi but still rocks ! and scorpiolina , she commented and said french dubbing . well this is originally a german movie not french . so yea . second of all there was a plot , maybe your not familiar with history . oh and her mother played the part of her governess , not her teacher . and the storyline was actually not cinderella but queen victoria , maybe u missed that detail . but anyway . yea the history in this movie is great , i love historical movies and queen victoria is very fascinating ! i love all the historical stuff . like that guy that was trying to manipulate her mom . and when she ran away and met her future husband and he showed her the new type of dance waltzing . when waltzing was new it was considered kinda scandalous because the couples dance so close . yea her governess was like oh my god ! and also the clothes , i love the clothes . the styles are great , hoop skirts are awesome . and of course romy always looks very pretty .
2			seem	evil	mystery	true	reaction	magnificent	cross	great			of the elements that make this the best at this point , i have to say 1 is christine mcintire . shemp's scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent . i imagine that , as one poster suggested , christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene , but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil , to be smiling at shemp's possibly dying . another character who helps this stand out is the goon . his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball . hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or , for that matter anywhere . i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this , but hey , when a short is this good , who's going to complain . not
2			vision	horrible	gilberte	beautiful	movie	political	reality	aware no	art	political	creation	artistic			la maman et la putain is the beautifulest film of all time . and what's most moving about it may be the relation between reality and art the movie deals with , which is directly inspired by proust's a la recherche du temps perdu . indeed , la maman et la putain and in search of lost time apparently tell the same story the one of the failure of love , which repeats itself endlessly . the first woman's name is always gilberte , and the second woman appears like a twisted and deformed double of gilberte veronika is like a whore gilberte , beautiful like the night , whereas gilberte was pure , and beautiful like the day . after the failure of the first love , a second love begins , but this one is like already doomed by the first one . veronika takes the place of gilberte , in alexandre's life and in the movie . she progressively eclipses her , first by time to time , gilberte's still coming when alexandre waits for veronika , then totally . that shows it's the same sad story repeating itself , the same unfaithful woman , like alexandre says , who appears endlessly and unfaithful is for proust the higher point in love , which makes it exist , but which also underlines its illusions . art is what causes the passage between what's outside the illusion of love to what's inside , which is the truth , and is a learning of this truth . for instance , when veronika notices the strange way alexandre makes is bed , he answers that he saw it in a movie , and then , that a movie , it's made for that , to learn how to live , how to make a bed . alexander wants to live like he was in a film , he wants his life to be art . this conception of art comes from proust , with whom eustache shares the same rejection of political art and realism in art . la maman et la putain fights against a conception of art principaly political see for example the ironical review of a political movie by alexandre . like proust says art doesn not care for all this proclamations , and only exists in silence . first of all , art is introspection . and that also why realism or naturalism is rejected art needs to transform reality to exi st proust writes i discover the illusion of realism , which is a lie . that's why la maman et la putain doesn not hide its artificiality , underlines by the way the actors say their text the more you seem artificial , the higher you go , said eustache . eustache and proust both share this idea that the artist is a translater of a inner truth . but , alexandre failed where eustache succeed . la maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is . you can sens the tragedy arise when you go further in the movie , which becomes sadde st you can see it in the face of alexandre , who looks more and more like a living dead . you can see it by the fact that the scenes become longer , and that after a while , nothing happens outside . at the end of the movie , when you see alexandre writing , and veronika asking if he's writing his life , you can guess that he's not , that even literature failed . the end of the movie shows the symbolic death of alexander , who is smashes by the heaviness of reality . and in this tiny nurse's room , alexandre looks more like albertine than marcel . to explain this failure , we can say that alexandre is a balzac's reader . in forme et signification , jean rousset explains that , in proust's , the readers of balzac , who are swann and charlus , are unable of any artistic creation , because they are stuck in reality , which they mistake with art . they see reality in art and are not aware of the transformations that necessarily exist between the life of an artist and his work , between reality and art . and that's exactly alexandre . he claims for instance that he loves a woman for parallel reasons , because she played in a bresson's for example . he's like swann , who falls in love with odette because she looks like a botticelli's woman . life is perhaps not my vocation . this thought is indeed by eustache , who committed suicide , even if it's said by alexandre . nevertheless , there is a difference between alexandre and eustache if eustache is absolutely alexandre , alexandre is like a double without art , a horrible vision of the artist , which crystallizes his fears . by fallowing veronika at the end of the movie , alexandre is condemned to illusions . it's death that remind me the last frames of the movie , in the face of jean pierre laud as well as in the endless pucking of veronika . or maybe it is already hell that describes the end , like in sarte's huit clot , and absolutely not like in the final liberation of le temps retrouv . if eustache had read proust , alexandre could never have finish the book , always perturbed by life and veronika when he tries to read it at his apartment or in the cafs . la maman et la putain is like a inverse double of in search of lost times , which tells how alexander doesn not become an artist , whereas a la recherche du temps perdu tells how marcel becomes a writer genette . if , like baudelaire says , an artiste tells reality at the light of his dream , it is his nightmare that eustache tells us in la maman et la putain .
2			it	good	it	funny	it	wrong	movie	bad no	point	good	trash	poor			the film maybe goes a little far , but if you love the show it's what you expect . it's not a bad movie ; it's actually pretty good . if you don not like the show , don not see the movie . it starts off a little slow maybe , but then picks up and turns out to be pretty funny . there are even a few heart wrenching scenes toward the end . after all the protagonists have gone through these scences do get to you . also jerry throws in his opinion why his show upsets people and justifies his show's existience . he's got a pretty good point . we care so much about the private details of celebrities lives , so why is it wrong that these people tell their private lives on national tv , too . if they were celebrities we wouldn not mind at all , we would eat it up . do we not like his guest doing this just because they are poor white trash and it reminds us that there really is poverty in this world and not just rich glamous movie stars living in a leave it to beaver world ?
2			story	great	accent	british	it	worth			not knowing what this film was about , i checked it out at the video store and after seeing it , i enjoyed it . little seen multi genre flick from director bernard rose candyman , immortal beloved . great story and characters . as a fan of glenne healdy's , i was surprised of her british accent . the only exception for this film was the ending . however , it is worth the rent .

2			words	unbelievable			we stumbled upon the documentary , grey gardens , last sunday and got sucked in without warning . everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of edith and edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach , eating ice cream and corn on the cob which was cooked on the bedside table and the cat urinating on edith's bed and her unbelievable words , i thrive on it the smell . we had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in . spellbinding ! a must see ! !

2			vision	special	weapons	fantastic	enemies	hard	resemblance	little			when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing , you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work . undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay . speaking of gameplay , the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience . the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game . the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision . the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you .
2			images	strong	flic	little	flic	quiet	god	dead			letters with no destination end up in another world found in the back rooms of the post office . here , alice manages to land a job in hope of finding her lost father . what she does discover is the tormented soul of her boss , frank . a quiet little aussie flic that came and went at the cinema . now you find it in the deep dark corner of the video shop , overshadowed by fifty copies of that dreaded godzilla film . it's a shame because this turned out to be a satisfying film telling a brave tale with strong simple images and effective performances from the two leads . this film succeeds where garry marshall's other dead letter office flic dear god 1996 usa failed , and comes close to the brilliance of , not the kevin costner turkey , but he jianjun's postman 1995 china .
2			directions	considerable	cost	low	things	foolish	script	weak	tomba	best			i have recently watched this movie , in a lazy sunday afternoon , with some friend of mine and we have a lot of fun ! this movie is a masterpiece of trash . try to watch it with this purpose ! it hadn not been expected , of course , but the performance provided by the actors and alberto tomba is absolutely the best , the weak script and the low cost budget had created an amazing mix of foolish things . tomba was just retired from alpine ski racing , where he was a dominant technical skier in the late 1980 and 1990 . tomba won three olympic gold medals , two world championships , and nine world cup season titles . seriously about the director nobody knows why damiano damiani he has signed this movie . all the other damiani's directions are considerable .
2			rating	average	kids	believable	feel	comfortable no	i	concerned	hamlet	good	ones	young			this is what a movie should be when trying to capture the essence of that which is very surreal . it has this hazy overtone that is rarely captured on film , it feels like a dream sequence and really moves you into a dark haunting memory . the kids were extremely believable and i do expect some things to come of them in the future . very natural acting for such young ones , i don not know if bill pulled it out of them or there just that good , but no the less excellent . bill scored as far as i m concerned and for the comment by kevnjeff about mr paxtons bad acting , what can one do in that role . he played the part rather well in my opinion . this is coming from someone who said hamlet was good the ethan hawke version ? wow . . do not listen to his comments . great flick to make you feel really uncomfortable , if that's what you want ? cinematography gets an above the average rating also .

2			mother	dead	cannon	loose	it	worth	they	married	wai	unstoppable	showdown	big			i watched the dvd of this movie which also comes with an excellent commentary track in english . it seems in cambodia the subtitles in english say the character is speaking thai but the movie says cambodia a very violent evil man is raising boys to be killers using starvation and training them to fight and kill . he sends pang to kill some people in china and during the killings a cop's partner is killed . the cop wai is a loose cannon who is worried about his father who is also a cop who was shot and is in a coma . wai's chief is his dad's friend and is worried about wai's erratic behavior . he doesn not know wai was the one who caught his dad in dealing with drug dealers and shot him and put him into the coma . pang escapes and hides in a squalid landfill shack where he meets a woman who came here to find her mother and keeps repeating her father won not let her leave pang doesn not speak chinese and doesn not understand this but saves her from her father who appears to be having sex with her maybe this is the reason for cat iii . wai becomes more and more obsessed with getting pang but pang is almost unstoppable . even after pang steals a boat and takes the woman to his home where they are married and she becomes pregnant wai follows and joins the evil man who's training the boys making a deal to fight and train so he can get pang . there is a big showdown between wai and pang with the terribly abused woman the major victim and leaving wai dead and pang cutting out his child from the dead mother only to die and leave him as the possible next boy to be raised as a killer . this film is beautifully photographed with an excellent soundtrack . there are many very brutal violent scenes . the woman having a long nail pulled out of her foot . knives to the neck and torso . guns fired directly to the head . and several very intense beatings . it maybe grim intense and downbeat but it is definitely worth seeing .
2			documentary	best	hero	biggest			putting the ufo thing aside . this was the best documentary i have seen . factual reporting by neil and buzz . a must see . the interviews and reporting are a revelation since most of the information was stamped confidential in 1969 and only released in 2006 no documentary to date has the detail or accuracy for such a brief 47 minutes . the facts will blow you away , and you will be left in awe of the risks taken to be the first on the moon . neil and buzz are probably the biggest hero's of our time . ever see a man save his own life ? bet not . neil saves his life when only mili seconds separated him from death . amazing to watch . it is a travesty people have not known all the details assosiated with landing on the moon and the courage those men had when facing certain death , from a failing computer . 10 stars !
2			movie	good	forces	imperial	scene	best	film	classic	ending	good	duel	best	scenes	greatest	character	original			a very good movie . a classic sci fi film with humor , action and everything . this movie offers a greater number of aliens . we see the rebel alliance leaders and much of the imperial forces . the emperor is somewhat an original character . i liked the ewoks representing somehow the indigenous savages and the vietnamese . excellent references i loved the duel between vader and luke which is the best of the saga . in return of the jedi the epilogue of the first trilogy is over and the empire finally falls . i also appreciated the victory celebration where it fulfills vader's redemption and returns hi into anakin skywalker spirit along with yoda and obi wan . it gives a sadness and a tear . the greatest scenes in star wars are among this movie when vader turns on the emperor . luke watches and finds comfort in seeing obi wan , yoda father 1997 version not hayden christenssen . the next best scene is when luke rushes to strike back darth vader to protect leia . there is a deep dark side of this film despite there is a good ending . i felt there was much more than meets the eye . and as always the john william's music will bring the classicism into star wars universe .
2			angel	straightforward	bit	likable	hagar	young	husband	alcoholic	hagar	biblical	foot	wrong	girl	young	horne	exceptional	girlfriend	naive	bram	married	man	young	stops	emotional	activities	social	interpretation	conventional	energy	new	couple	young	farmer	poor			in canadian director kari skogland's film adaptation of the margaret laurence novel the stone angel ellen burstyn is hagar shipley , a proud and cantankerous woman approaching her nineties who wishes to remain independent until the very end , stubbornly refusing to be placed in a nursing home by her well meaning son marvin . filmed in manitoba , canada and set in the fictional town of manawaka , the stone angel is a straightforward and conventional interpretation of the book that has been required reading in canadian high school english classes for almost half a century . the title of the film comes from the stone statue erected on hagar's mother's grave which serves as a metaphor for hagar's inability to express emotion during her tumultuous lifetime . burstyn brings vulnerability and humor to the role but is a bit too likable to fully realize the ego driven , self defeating character who managed to alienate her wealthy father , her well meaning but alcoholic husband , and both of her sons . as she nears the end of her days , she reflects that pride was my wilderness and the demon that led me there was fear . i was alone , never anything else , and never free , for i carried my chains within me , and they spread out from me and shackled all i touched . confronting having to spend her last days in a nursing home , hagar looks back at her life and looks at her failed relationships , her recollections shown in flashbacks without voice over narration . the story begins with a dance that she attended as a young girl . chaperoned by her aunt dolly , she meets her future husband , the previously married bram shipley cole / wings hauser , a poor farmer whose reputation in the town is sullied because of his association with the native american population . the young hagar is played by christine horne who is exceptional in her first feature role . despite hagar's pleading , her relationship with bram is rejected by her cold and rigid father whose refusal to attend the wedding starts the marriage off on the wrong foot . this is exacerbated by his leaving all of his money to the town of manawaka , condemning the young couple to a life of poverty . going through the motions of her marriage to bram , hagar withdraws from social activities to prevent being rejected by the town's upper classes . when she produces two sons , marvin dylan baker and john kevin zegers , she is unable to give them the love that they need . every joy i might have held in my man or any child of mine or even the plain light of morning , she reflects , all were forced to a standstill by some break of proper appearanceswhen did i ever speak the heart's truth ? like the biblical hagar who fled to the desert because she could not tolerate further affronts to her pride , hagar leaves manawaka to live in ontario but eventually returns to the shipley farm . as the scene shifts back to the present , hagar runs away to an abandoned house near the ocean that she remembers from her childhood to escape from being placed in a nursing home by marvin and his wife doris sheila mccarthy , here she meets a young man named leo luke kirby who takes an interest in her and compels her to look at and take responsibility for the mistakes she made in her life . the stone angel pulls out all the emotional stops but never fully develops its characters to the point where i felt any stake in the story's outcome , although the spirited performance by ellen page as john's devoted but naive girlfriend and the moving final scenes bring a new energy to the film's second half .
2			show	stale	it	different	it	original	program	stale			. but i enjoyed this show anyway . i have been reading some of the comments prior reviewers have had to say about this show , and i m having a hard time completely nullifying all the criticism in my own head except one that the show was stale ; this program was anything but stale . a lot of the stuff people take issue with about this show is on the money pretentious ; forced ; overwrought ; desperate for attention ; self satisfied ; annoying ever present narration . but you know what ? i really liked it . it was different , it was original , it really , really tried ; and that made up for all the minuses . the show was bright , verbal , quick , witty , interesting , fun to look at . you know , it was only on once a week , i could take it once a week and look forward to it and enjoy it . i will mourn its passing . but i guess nobody will be bringing this back to life .
2			movie	original	it	poor	it	boring	respect	due	film	low	thriller	psychological	experience	intellectual	movie	worth	cinema	local	rating	low	i	surprised	direction	great			i am surprised at imdb's low rating of this movie . with all due respect , its low rating is representative of the iq level of those who rated it so poor . they would rather see a movie with cheap thrills , a bigger budget , and more gore . the first misconception by people is that this is a horror film . it is not , nor does the film mislead you into believing it is one . it is a psychological thriller . it is for people who actually want an intellectual experience when watching a movie . 's review is the perfect example of how i feel about this movie . all the other negative reviews doesn not make much sense . it's almost as if trying to make an original movie for a change very rare these days is something bad and not worth it . i will reveal some spoilers for the morons who said it was boring and didn not make sense . martha was brainwashing herself and performing experiments on herself to be a caring mother while she really was an evil nazi who would kill without warning . the evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that at first viewing , we sympathize with this cold blooded monster for the duration of the movie is a testament to the film's direction and writing . i definitely feel that this movie should at least be rated in the 6 s range on originality alone . i recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the iq scale aka smart people since this movie is obviously being butchered by those who would rather watch scream or freddy's nightmare . kudos to the acting as well . for such a low budget film , you are amazed that this movie didn not hit your local cinema with the great direction , writing , and acting . please don not be fooled by the rating by imdb . this movie is worth it . i actually recommend buying the film since a first viewing on a rent will not do this justice .
2			development	nice	people	good	trouble	little	job	nice			nice character development in a pretty cool milieu . being a male , i m probably not qualified to totally understand it , but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start . it isn not as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher . what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters . each has their own thing that they contend with . once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs , they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion . what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn not go for cheap comedy when it could have . it didn not try to pound a lesson into us . the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light . i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly , but , within this world , it needed to happen . good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people .
2			poetry	great	students	young	kind	rare	poems	great	i	glad	work	visual	professor	former	literature	classic	counselor	academic	artists	famous			this filmed presentation of the rime of the ancient mariner is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of coleridge's haunting poem . the striking cinematography , combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists , and michael redgrave's superb narration , are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual work . in the age of television , such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students , as well as adults , to explore and to learn the value of great poetry . to the best of my knowledge , this kind of work is indeed rare ; that is regrettable . as a student of world literature and as a former college professor and academic counselor , i feel that more great epic poems like coleridge's rime of the ancient mariner should be so translated . although not a movie critic , but as an avid reader of classic literature , i am glad to recommend this fine production without any reservations whatsoever .
2			student	young	couple	naive	adults	young	half	french	student	french	landscapes	urban	individuals	spiritual	rendezvous	romantic	millennium	new	poets	dead	it	worth	rendezvous	classical	actors	young			i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of before sunrise 1995 and before sunset 2004 , and saw both films in a row , without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately . after sleeping it over , i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter , and i shall explain why . before sunrise introduces us with then young actors , ethan hawke reality bites , dead poets society , only 25 at the time of the film's release ; and julie delpy the three colors trilogy , then 26 although looking much younger . he is a promiscuous american writer , touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend ; she is a young french student , on her way home to paris . they meet on the budapest vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together . the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna , exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love . the film has 1990 s written all over it back then , technology was leaping rapidly , the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner , and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future . the characters of jesse hawke and celine delpy , with all their flaws and inconsistencies celine's accent , if by mistake or on purpose , was half american half french , and it swinged from one spectrum to the other , breaking the character's credibility , were a mirror of the time . watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement , acting all clichd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well , is what really made this movie work for me . the fact that the director doesn not let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while . all in all , sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna , a well told classical romantic rendezvous , and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future .
2			cryer	big no	me	wrong	schindler	classic	list	good no	title	single no	members	good	directors	greatest			1985 was a good year for films maybe even great but this one missing out on a gong went a long way to convincing fans that ol oscar is little more that a hood ornament for good party members . 11 nominations and not a single title such was the academy's disdain for one of their greatest directors ; and one who had to wait another 8 years before whatever prejudices had prevented them from handing him the statue before allowed them to give him 7 for schindler's list , which is , arguably , not as good and i m half polish . don not get me wrong , schindler was a classic . and i m not knocking out of africa which won that year either ; but it was , in my mind , a class behind this one an epic story of suffering and hope that brought me to tears and i m not a big cryer . maybe it was the music superb , or the cinematography sumptuous , but more likely simply the acting whoopi , who proved to all of us that she was much more than just a comedienne ; danny glover , who i would never heard of before ; and , of course , oprah . the rest is history ; but , at the time who knew ?
2			circumstances	ridiculous	ending	emotional	road	different	place	emotional	chaos	creative	life	young	vanity	real	world	lively	thought	little	comedy	physical	work	best	movie	complete	disdain	weary	adult	experienced	mother	weak	commitment	emotional	i	surprised			hal hartley's henry fool was an independent film masterpiece and certainly his best work . it has immense character depth , subtle , complicated dialogue , and an excellent , emotional ending which captivates . i remember pausing it several times during my first viewing to absorb what i was seeing and feeling . henry fool was a complete movie from start to finish , and needed no sequel . thus i was surprised when i heard about fay grim . fay was not one of the main characters of the first film and seemed to exist more as the troubling imposition of real world vanity and ignorance for her brother simon to be forced to deal with as he matures . in her own movie , fay matures herself , though her maturity takes a very different road . simon went from near autistic isolation to a merely somewhat introverted genius . fay starts her adult journey as an immature , utterly normal , spoiled child and responds to the onslaught of ridiculous circumstances by becoming a mature , utterly normal , experienced adult who holds no advantages . she deals with problems the way any human does , with determination , a little thought , and weary disdain . while simon learned to control his mind , fay learns to control her emotion . the movie contains several fondly remembered elements of its prequel , but differs vastly in tone for most of the film . henry fool showed you a harsh , boring , ignorant world which contrasted with simon's inner passion and creativity . in fay grim , the world is a lively , crazy , emotional place which shows the silliness of her young life , and through contrast unearths the inner wise woman which had not been previously developed or nurtured by her similarly weak mother . the movie is in two parts , the first dealing with the beginning of fay's struggle and subsequent hardening due to authoritarian hostility , and the second dealing with her battle to soften only just enough to regain henry . at first , fans of henry fool may find themselves wondering how the movie can even be considered a sequel , and thinking it is profane to follow such an intense film with spy game antics and physical comedy . but this is where the subtlety of fay grim lies . the sequel is about fay's journey , and as i said before , hers is one of finding the life giving sanity in chaos , not the creative chaos in staid order . parker posey is an excellent actress who captures hal hartley's tongue in cheek humor perfectly . elina lwensohn perhaps eclipses her in emotional commitment to the role , allowing parker to play both straight man and comic against the lively , stage like comedy happening around her . with the entrance of henry into the picture , the movie begins to take a sobering turn . hal hartley's movies are all plays , and every play must come full circle . by the end , you are shown fay's newly developed character and integrity are the offspring of her time with the fatally intense henry , whose piercing honesty and unique passion lights a spark in anyone he meets . fay grim is an excellent movie which does not surpass henry fool , but shows through hal's range that the nuances of his art are the proof of his genius . honestly , i think anyone who bashes this movie not only missed the point by a mile and especially the subtlety in parker posey's acting , but could not have been much interested the movie henry fool .

2			cameroon	northern	girl	french	period	similar	girl	young	government	french			this movie shows life in northern cameroon from the perspective of a young french girl , france dalens , whose father is an official for the colonial french government , and whose family is one of the few white families around . it gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated . it's a sense consistent with another movie i have seen about africa in a similar time period nirgendwo in afrika 2001 , but i have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is . it's not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated . the viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him , although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman's visit to south western cameroon as an adult provides some perspective .

2			actor	great			i enjoyed watching cliffhanger , at the beginning when that woman sarah was full of terror when she was slipping , i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see , your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster . i did like watching cliffhanger , i think silvestar stallone is a great actor and i think he will be known as playing rambo and rocky .
2			animation	incredible	cities	great	protagonists	interesting	i	glad	interesting	likable	plot	unique no	monsters	wonderful			have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon ? oh , you have ? was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds , and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey ? did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon ? i didn not think so . i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i m really glad that i did ! it's one of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen . much like the pixar movies , it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world . the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen , and this attention to detail is staggering the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites . the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action . although the plot may not be entirely unique , the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching . our protagonists are likable and interesting , ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path . of course , hector is the character most will fall in love with . a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english , hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of . in summary , i would recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity . watch it for the incredible animation , the breath taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you have seen on a cinema or television screen . at the very least , it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half no matter if you are nine or twenty nine which , in fact , i am !
2			dynamics	great	few	alive	girl	good	film	great	i	familiar no	music	good	drama	historical	spirited	strong	reviews	great	adolescent	young	lines	great			expecting to see another nunsploitation movie with a mean mother superior abusing and torturing her charges , flavia turned out to be much more than i had anticipated . it actually has a feminist storyline , though i don not think such a term existed in the era in which the movie is set . it certainly wasn not practiced . women and the jews and the poor are very downtrodden and locked into menial spots in society . throughout the story , sister flavia florinda bolkan witnesses the tyranny of her time until she just can not sit there any longer and actually does something about it , albeit with disastrous results . the pre credit sequence has flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield . she sees an injured evil muslim soldier one of the few still alive and tries to assist him . before she can , her hate filled father beheads the soldier and waves his head in her face great family dynamics , huh ? after this , her father forces her to join a convent where she witnesses even more injustice . though scenes do involve violence , rape and nuns , i would consider this more of a historical drama than nunsploitation . indeed , many of the ingredients for a trashy exploitation piece are there , but the acting , camera work , storyline and music are too good to keep it down in that level . most nun films i have seen usually have the basic premise of a good girl somehow winds up in a convent , where the mother superior is a supreme bitch that likes to whip people and / or make their lives a living hell . flavia spends much of the first part of he movie passively questioning all of the atrocities happening around her . much of her passivity is forgotten when she becomes acquainted with the strong spirited but slightly loony she likes to pee outside like me , but it's a lot easier for guys sister agatha . when a group of muslims attack their abbey , flavia and agatha do not cower in fear like the other nuns . their attackers actually function as their liberators of the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey . in fact , it is a christian , not a muslim invader , that impales dear sister agatha . it is agatha's death that sends flavia on her violent crusade against those who have oppressed her . her father treats her like dirt . her muslim lover deserts her at a very inopportune time . i don not want to give out too much of the rest of the story , but be prepared to be shocked , devastated and saddened at the conclusion . this is a great film , so don not be put off by its undeserved reputation as a trash epic . plus , how on earth could a movie featuring florinda bolkan and claudio cassinelli go wrong ? i am not familiar with mara casares other works , but sister agatha is a hell of a character . i have read many great reviews of the synapse us release , but i love my german x rated kult dvd copy . it isn not anamorphic / 16 9 but actually has a little more picture information on all of the edges than synapse's release . and there are also many great , wise or funny lines of dialogue many from sister agatha why is god male ? the father , the son , and the holy spirit they are all male ! flavia these men are afraid look at them , sister afraid their power will be taken away from them ! sr . agatha regarding christians fleeing after the muslims arrive woman , where are you going ? the moslems can do nothing to you that the christians haven not done ! ha ha ha ! sr . agatha to a group of fleeing christian women lord bless these moslems for putting fear into these pompous christians . flavia does it take the mere sight of a moslem to make you $h ! t your underclothing ? sr . agatha closing message flavia gaetani , not yet a muslim no longer a christian was punished as a runaway nun . the idea for the film came from events which occurred during the musalman invasions of italy culminating in what even today is remembered as the martyrdom of the 800 at otranto

2			seemed	perfect	movie	best no	him	happy	homo	best	characters	commercial	boy	young			maybe presque rien is not the best movie ever made . but it is better than many of you have said . i still haven not seen a homo themed movie better than this one . you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies , with a clear beginning , development and outcome . but european movies are less narrative , but makes you think much and feel . many of you didn not understand the sense of the movie . the purpose of this one is not show us a simple summer loving movie , with commercial characters who fall in love and live happy forever . summer holidays and beach are only a background , and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys . maybe some of you didn not understand well this movie , because of its 3 parts , showed as flashbacks . these 3 moments are summertime in pornichet , when they meet and love . after a year and half living together in nantes , mathieu doesn not go to a psychiatric himself . he tries to suicide taking something , and cedric brings him to hospital . later , he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that . the last part , is when mathieu come back to pornichet , in winter , alone . to think about how his life have changed , how his life become to be , and trying to find himself . it's possible that some people couldn not understand all this well , because all the scenes are mixed among them . but anyway , as i said before . this is not a funny movie . if what someone want to see is meat , for that , we have belami movies . presque rien , what want to show us , is how cruel can be the life , for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life . mathieu only wants to go away from home , and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness . but what seemed perfect at the beginning . later is not as good as he thought , and he become troubled , and feel that he has lost the way of his life . he is lost and doesn not know what he really wants to do , or what makes him happy . he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide . so , funny ? is not a funny movie . very hot scenes ? only a few . but this is not a movie for entertainment . is all about feelings . friendship , love , happiness , unhappiness , pain , depression , loneliness . i , as many others , feel identified with life and problems of mathieu , and that is what director wanted to do . a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life . for me , the best homo themed movie ever .
2			monk	sympathetic	light	classic	te	original	man	young	choreography	fantastic	blend	magical	film	violent			return to the 3 h chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36 h chamber of shaolin , in which gordon liu played shan te , a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter . in this sequel liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten . he imitates the original shan te , tries all manner of tricks to get into shaolin temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses . its a classic light hearted martial arts tale , with the ace production values of the shaw brothers and the sure footed direction of lui chia liang . the choreography is fantastic throughout , whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and gordon liu's performance , as are the others , particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material . the film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander , more violent and sweeping shaw brothers fil ms but few have such a magical blend of slapstick , unique training and fighting , with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good . full of light hearted joy , its impossible not to give this the highest score .
2			work	outstanding	adaptation	hilarious	note	false	scene	classic	performance	hilarious	oscar	best	agent	theatrical	actor	best	other	hate			the sunshine boys was the hilarious 1975 screen adaptation of neil simon's play about a retired vaudevillian team , played by walter matthau and george burns , who had a very bitter breakup and have been asked to reunite one more time for a television special or something like that . the problem is that the two still hate each other and want nothing to do with each other . richard benjamin appears as matthau's nephew , a theatrical agent who has been given the monumental responsibility of making this reunion a reality . this warm and winning comedy is a lovely valentine to a forgotten form of entertainment . vaudeville and it works mainly thanks to one of neil simon's better screenplays and outstanding work by matthau , burns , and benjamin . burns won the best supporting actor oscar for this , but i think matthau walks away with this film with his flawlessly hilarious performance as willy clark . matthau was nominated for best actor but didn not stand a chance against nicholson for one flew over the cuckoo's nest ; however , in another year , this was an oscar worthy performance . matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance . the scene where he is auditioning for a potato chip commercial and can not get the name of the product right is a classic . the sunshine boys is a warm and winning neil simon comedy which shines thanks to unbeatable chemistry between matthau and burns .

2			ending	best	seems	inevitable	translation	real			to me , this review may contain spoilers , but i like watching movies with no idea of what is going to happen , so therefore i think many of the other reviews here of this movie contain spoilers ! i just watched this movie again , and i must reiterate that it has the best ending to any movie . ever . ever . ever . the real translation , not he beating of the butterfly's wings , is oddly not used as the translated title . i suppose they thought most americans wouldn not know what chaos theory is except for those who saw or read jurassic park . the movie is based on chaos theory , and how one small event can affect the outcome of seemingly unrelated events , which all lead back to one event . the movie is a whirlwind of wondrous cause and effect , as we follow the chain of chaos as it intertwines between several characters about 20 . in a way , the ending seems inevitable despite this , but if you think about it , it is a perfect ending . think to yourself , what else needed to be said ? it is at the same time a very brave ending . too bad we have to go overseas for a gem like this one , but an ending like this would never come out of hollywood .

2			states	united	leader	charismatic	devoid	despicable	film	incredible	job	great	documentation	active			this really is an incredible film . not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the united states up for its dishonesty , subterfuge , and blatant disregard for human rights and self determination . chavez is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice . these filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed before . and in the cross hairs we see the usa , once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality . it's heart breaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion of democracy that we are witnessing is a tool long used by successive american governments and their seemingly blinkered citizens . the footage makes it clear that this is not a manipulation of tv or generic footage but an active documentation of a people and its government fighting for its future . truly a moving experience for anyone with a conscience . these irish film makers deserve our gratitude . long live chavez . we need to enshrine the notion that each country must be allowed to choose its government and to develop in ways that the majority sees fit . first phase in this process is the need to know what the realities of the situation are , and this documentary does a great job of doing just that .

2			lines	bad	characters	different			ok , i don not really think that trailer park boys has bad story lines , because they kick ass . they ju st . conflict with each other . for example near the end of the movie , it shows ricky and julian telling patrick lewis to put the dog down and walk away . then at the end , it shows ricky and julian saying that they have been in jail for 2 years . in the tv series pilot , the first clip they show is the same clip of ricky and julian yelling at patrick lewis . but in the tv series , they have supposedly only been in jail for 18 months . also , they give us the impression that the movie's story line and the tv series story line are connected because of the yelling scene between the guys . but some actors portray totally different characters . of course , patrick roach plays patrick lewis in the movie , but in the series he plays randy . sam tarasco plays one of the guys who pays ricky for an extermination , and then he plays sam losco in the series . also again . i know , i have a lot to say , in the movie , the guys snort coke instead of smoking hash . the thing is , they never actually confirm that the two story lines are connected in anyway , other than the yelling scene . sorry to keep on blabbing .
2			feel	disjointed	struggle	new	guerrilla	revolutionary	ties	previous	portrayal	poignant	contrast	direct	downfall	inevitable	cast	central	whole	memorable	manner	easy	performances	nuanced			following directly from where the story left off in part one , the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man's legacy is exactly as such . in direct contrast to the first feature , part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country , to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties . the change of setting isn not just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature , replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical , battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle . yet , as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle . while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that , part two takes a much more refined , callous and bleak segment of che's life and ambition , and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible , easy to grasp manner . while the movie's tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however , there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible . this somewhat distant , cold approach to telling che's story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off ; indeed , i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything , the entirety of che , taken as a whole , delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man's struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way . by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago excuse the ironic contrast ; che is a slow moving , reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably conducted the whole thing . yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak , decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two , the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn not feel too disjointed from its predecessor , but does enough to give it its own reference points . here , the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere's the initial struggle , the battles , the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them , all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement . yet , as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know , part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming , and disquieting note . this difference , in combination with the similarities to part one , make a compelling and memorable whole ; by all means , both could be digested one their own and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such and enjoyed as they are , but taken as one statement , che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve . indeed , everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building , realistically structured combat scenesthe drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible , but with a feature such as this , part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don not necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged . in fact , upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one , and title the review as a whole , yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively . with that said , i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime , but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part's ability to do just that . with a reflective , intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie's characters without drawing attention to themselves , che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor , but this time with a tragic but uplifting , reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film . a review by jamie robert ward
2			subject	important	twister	weak	tornado	famous	tornadoes	serious	states	united	characters	safe	tornadoes	rare	tornado	close	hemisphere	northern			i have had a morbid fascination with tornadoes for more than 40 years , since my 5 h grade teacher , a native texan , told stories of ones he saw in his youth . fortunately , i have lived my whole life in the middle atlantic states , where tornadoes are rare and usually not as violent as the ones in the midwest , but i have had two close encounters , one in pa and the other in nj , in the past decade . i enjoyed the family scenes , particularly the conflicts between jack and dan hatch . when the tornado was close , dan knew most of what he had to do , and he probably learned this in school , since i know that tornado safety is an important subject in parts of the the united states where these storms are more frequent . however , characters in the movie did two things that some people think are supposed to be done or are safe to do in tornadoes but are actually not supposed to be done or are unsafe . when the siren first sounded , dan and arthur went through the house and opened the windows . for years , this is what people were told to do , but tornado safety web sites now advise against doing this . also , people were shown hiding in a highway underpass . this method was made popular by an early 1990 video made by a t . v . crew during a relatively weak twister in kansas . however , in the most serious tornadoes , people can be sucked out from these underpasses . this happened during a may 1999 outbreak in oklahoma . the tornadoes in this movie hit in the fall , which is not a common time for them to happen . then again , one of my close encounters took place in late september . also , they traveled from northwest to southeast , while most such storms in the northern hemisphere go from southwest to northea st however , this is not all that unusual . a famous tornado that struck joliet , il , in the early 1990 traveled in that direction as did the one involved in my other close encounter . i think that the movie should have been set in the spring . this movie was based on a book that in turn was based on an actual event that happened on june 3 1980 but it was still a compelling story .
2			it	musical	roles	individual	haver	charming	it	romantic	macmurray	perfect			saw it as many times as i could before it left the scene . a delightful and entertaining film with some of my very favorite stars . only wish i could find it again ! would certainly buy / view it if i could . please , somebody , bring it back . fred macmurray was perfect in his role as a patriot during world war ii , and his leading ladies , joan leslie , and especially june haver were beautiful and charming . it was a musical , but also romantic , funny , and clever . this was my favorite movie starring june haver , although i always liked her . her dazzling smile lit up the screen , and her beauty and talent were an asset to any film . the supporting cast lent credit to their individual roles . a well balanced and light hearted film ; only wish we had more like it !

2			film	unique	camerawork	brilliant	voice	great	experience	unforgettable	editing	brilliant			europa zentropa is a masterpiece that gives the viewer the excitement that must have come with the birth of the narrative film nearly a century ago . this film is truly unique , and a work of genius . the camerawork and the editing are brilliant , and combined with the narrative tropes of alienation used in the film , creates an eerie and unforgettable cinematic experience . the participation of barbara suwkowa and eddie constantine in the cast are two guilty pleasures that should be seen and enjoyed . max von sydow provides his great voice as the narrator . a one of a kind movie ! four stars highest rating .

2			it	hate	story	pointless	choices	conscious	substance	real			with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity , this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene . the movie plays much like a dream , and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it . characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless . but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices . the film works isn not trying to work as history , but rather is a deconstruction of 1940 war movies . i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie , but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away . this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever , and there is a wild imagination in its style . i can completely understand why people would hate it , but i give it 9 10

2			it	essential	flux	moral			ossessione luchino visconti's debut film , this italian noir is generally credited with launching the neorealist movement well , it says so right on the back of the box and is a sometimes penetrating , sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux . set in fascist italy , an assortment of supporting characters including an ingenuous drifter who espouses communist virtues embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without , drifting phantasms longing for a soul . although visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well developed , the spider web of deceit is tenuous although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale , gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it the cosmic irony too didactic , the illicit relationship strained with bathos . all the same , it's incisive and essential , although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable .

2			ending	silly	film	french	friendship	believable			i saw this film first on my way home from paris to newark aboard air france in august 1996 the film itself i believe is quite a masterpiece . it's the kind of film that people should be making . i still think daniel auteuil is one of the sexiest actors around . in this french film , he plays a divorced father and businessman who has lost his zest for life until he across a down syndrome man who lives in an institution with other down syndrome patients . the actors including the actor who actually has down syndrome create a believable friendship and relationship between these two unlikely men . daniel's life and ours changes forever with the down syndrome man . he realizes that life is not just work and not play but for the living and loving and that's what life should be all about . the ending is kind of silly though but i still think it's one of my favorite movies . it's enough to bring a tear to your eye .
2			venezuela	revolutionary	insights	political	force	formidable	states	united	people	poor	savvy	political	dynamics	political	government	united			one of the most timely and engrossing documentaries , you will ever watch . while the story takes place in the venezuelan capital of caracas , it provides an intimate look into political dynamics , that prevail throughout the western hemisphere . while essentially another chapter in the story of the the united states backed , latin american coup , this film chronicles in real time , what can happen when the poorest people , are armed with unity , political savvy , and courage ! the political insights offered by this film are invaluable . one gets clear examples of the private media , as a formidable force for mass deception and propaganda . we see the poor people of caracas grappling with the brutal realities of american politics . one gets a clear sense of impending doom , if the people fail to address the blatant tyranny , which has been abruptly , and illegally , thrust upon them by the conspirators . we also see the arrogance and fascism , of the cia backed , private media , plutocrats , and generals , who have conspired to bring venezuela back under washington's domination . though ably led by president hugo chavez , the people of caracas are forced to act without him , after chavez was forcibly kidnapped by renegade generals . their response is the highpoint of the film . if one seeks an excellent portrait of what the the united states government , hugo chavez , and revolutionary venezuela , are all about , this movie is it !
2			soldiers	experienced	scene	scary	defenders	british	attackers	german	scene	memorable			i saw this at the theater in the early 1970 s . the most memorable and scary scene is when the german army attacks with yellow cross mustard gas for the first time . the germans and their horses are covered from head to toe or hoof with eerie protective suits . the experienced british soldiers don gas masks only and once again await the clouds of gas and the german attackers . the gas clouds move ever closer , finally enveloping the british defenders . the germans move forward slowly menacingly in their scary looking garb . suddenly a scream from the defenders . this gas is like no other that they have experienced before . now you will know why i have remembered this scene for the last 30 years and still shiver , i think that you will too !
2			performance	great	actress	best	globe	golden	piece	emotional	drama	powerful	fawcett	superb			farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama , where she plays marjorie , a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would be rapi st well done to farrah for being a golden globe best actress nominee . when her rapist joe terrifically played by james russo comes into her home , which she shares with her two roommates who are conveniently out ! marjorie has to play along with joe's frightening demands . it does make for some disturbing and shocking images ! when her roommates come home , they are astounded to say the least by marjorie's actions , and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police , makes the film even more nail biting . i do find diana scarwid quite irritating , but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all , it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed . overall , extremities is a brilliantly thought out and well acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now ! well done to everybody involved .
2			message	complex	songs	memorable no	musical	realistic no	find	little	store	local			i bought this cheap from the rental remnant at our local store . it was in almost mint condition , and i would never heard of it before . clearly nobody else had either . i can not believe my luck . you go through the whole realm of emotions and it attempts to get over a complex message the very moral and non triumphalist stance of the mandela party , undoubtedly . despite its enormous length i had to watch it in two sittings it was like a book one couldn not put down . perhaps the songs are not all that memorable , but the spirit of the thing glows on forever . i cannot understand comments that a musical clearly designed for stage is not realistic ! i have seen south pacific and read the book too , and can guarantee that musical is not realistic compared to the book . i will treasure this little find until it wears out . one day they will make this again on a better budget .

2			dickinson	impressive	houston	old	tale	traditional	writing	poor	soldier	professional			13 days to glory tells the traditional tale with sympathy toward the mexican viewpoint . the major problem in this movie was that while cowboy actor james arness played the part of jim bowie persuasively , the rest of the name actors in the cast brian keith davy crocket and lorne greene sam houston were too old . raul julia played general antonio lopez de santa anna with grace and dignity owed to the professional soldier who after all won the battle . the scene where he upbraids his officers for failing to mount a guard and prevent a sortee is one the scriptwriters did not understand . failing to keep watch is a major remiss in the military . santa anna was within his prerogatives to be angry . raul julia magnificently carried poor writing through the scene . kathleen york was an impressive susannah dickinson , a woman who deserves to be remembered for her courage . however , kathleen york might have been reminded that as dickinsons hailed from pennsylvania they probable dis not sound very southron .
2			film	powerful	film	great	reviews	poor	ensemble	big	releases	new	coincidence	melodramatic	i	old	driver	new	list	best	canyon	grand	something	special			i revisited grand canyon earlier this year when i set out to devise a ten best list of the 1990 s . i first saw the film when i was 17 years old . how did i hear about it ? it was reviewed , and recommended highly , by siskel & ebert in 1991 and i eventually caught it on video a year later . it's a great film , a powerful film , a healing film , about the power of listening , truly listening to one another . i have seen it six times now , and it entertains and inspires me with every subsequent viewing . but why the poor reviews for this movie ? maltin's movie guide gives it two out of four . too melodramatic , too much coincidence , too sappy , are the expressions that i read the mo st yes , there is melodrama in this story , and yes , there is a lot of coincidence , too . but it delivers with an intensity and force that seems supple . for all of the plot that exists in grand canyon , such as drive by shootings , a police chase , an earthquake , a love affair , a woman's discovery of a baby in the bushes , another shooting , a near accident by a new driver , and worldly advice from a homeless man , this movie wins because of the smart performances by kevin kline , steve martin , mary mcdonnell , alfre woodard , danny glover , and jeremy sisto . it also succeeds because of lawrence kasdan's skillful direction and writing . you know that this isn not just another movie when you consider a sequence at the beginning of the film that involves kevin kline being harassed by four black youths . danny glover plays a tow truck driver who assists the kline character , but not before he gets harassed too , by the leader of the bunch . listen to the dialogue as the kid suggests to glover , are you afraid of me because of me , or because i have a gun ? grand canyon is filled with one perceptive scene after another . steve martin should have been nominated for best supporting actor as a movie producer who has a change of heart and then a subsequent change of mind . i think his character is a warning that the good can carry us forward , that idealism is a virtue , but one that we must fight for constantly rather than depend upon . i fear that grand canyon may be lost forever in the wilderness of non new releases at the video store . but with the deals now on older releases as low as 99 cents , i plead with anyone who has read this far into a review from a reviewer that you will thank after having rented it , grand canyon is something special . if you loved magnolia , another movie with a big ensemble about deep humanist themes , you will love grand canyon , too .

2			fans	satisfied	it	interesting	part	good	woman	local	duke	new	torture	gruesome			there is so much that can be said about this film . it is not your typical nunsploitation . of course , there is nudity and sex with nuns , but that is almost incidental to the story . it is set in 15 h century italy , at the time of the martyrdom of 800 christians at otranto . the battle between the muslims and the christians takes up a good part of the film . it was interesting when everyone was running from the muslim hoards , that the mother superior would ask , why do you fear the muslims , they will not do anything that the christians have done to you ? certainly , there was enough torture on both sides . sister flavia florinda bolkan is sent to a convent for defying her father . in the process , she witnesses and endures many things the gelding of a stallion , the rape of a local woman by a new duke , the torture of a nun who was overcome during a visit by the tarantula sect , and a whipping herself when she ran off with a jew . the torture was particularly gruesome with hot wax being poured on the nun , and her nipples cut off . sister flavia is bound to continue to get into trouble as she questions the male dominated society in which she lives . she even asks jesus , why the father , son and holy ghost are all men . eventually , she joins the leader of the muslims as his lover and they sack the convent . here is where you see more flesh than you can possible enjoy at one time . but , tragedy is to come . she manages to exact sweet revenge on all , including the duke and her father , but finds that the muslim lover treats her exactly the same . she is a woman and that is all there is to it . i won not describe what the holy men of the church did to this heretic at the end , but it predates the torture of saw or hostel by decades . nunsploitation fans will be satisfied with the treats , but movie lovers will find plenty of meat to dige st
2			creatures	visible no	movie	real	importance	considerable	reality	real	creatures	visible	they	new no	idea	new no	everything	new	woman	beautiful	we	thankful			first , nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly . not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child . second , the main actress cheri christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future . third , this woman is that tremendously beautiful that i suggest the directors retire all those cameron diazes , eva mendezes , and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are . mrs christian is not a light , but a sun . however , dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance . they idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one own eyes is not new . but i have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times . this means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign , but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can . being a sign , the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects , that is , the sign behaves like an object . now , in our usual world of perception , it is common that objects change signs . f . ex . if someone grows a bird , his photograph will show him with beard , not without , as it did before . but the opposite , the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man . this is , very simply expressed , the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison , in this movie . this is new , and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known , mostly since the silent time .
2			film	little	exporters	finest	script	little	charles	young	script	superb	film	british	series	different	actors	finest	it	difficult no	story	inspiring	states	united	story	fun	britain	great	story	worth			spoilers many different comedy series nowadays have at one point or another experimented with the idea of obscure independence . in an early episode of cartoon family guy the griffin family find their home is an independent nation to the united states of america and the story progresses from there . way back in 1949 however , the ealing studios produced a wonderful little film along the same idea . after a child's prank , the residents of pimlico discover a small fortune in treasure . at the inquest it becomes clear that the small area is a small outcrop of the long lost state of burgundy . withdrawing from london and the rest of great britain , the residents of the small street experience the joys and the problems with being an independent state . based at a time when rationing was still in operation , this story is brilliantly told and equally inspiring . featuring performances by stanley holloway , betty warren , philip stainton and a young charles hawtrey , the film is well stocked with some of the finest actors of their generation . these actors are well aided as well by a superb little script with some cracking lines . feeling remarkably fresh , despite being over 50 years old , the story never feels awkward and always keeps the audience entertained . ealing studios was one of the finest exporters of british film ever in existence . with films like passport to pimlico it's not difficult to see why . amusing from start to finish , the story is always fun and always worth watching .
2			mark	famous	dracula	similar	touches	atmospheric			i take issue with the other reviewer's comments for the simple reason that this is a mystery film , not a supernatural one ! it is not the only film to have a seemingly supernatural explanation vampires , but turns out to be a very mundance one . other films that come to mind are edgar wallace's before dawn and the more famous mark of the vampire . the film does a wonderful job in creating a very spooky atmosphere , similar dracula , when renfield meets the count on the staircase of his castle , or in mark of the vampire , when the two people look thru the windows of the castle ruins and see a corpse playing an organ , while luna descends using wings ! very surreal ! if one likes these often silent atmospheric touches , this film is a must ! norm vogel
2			speed	good	talent	troubled	world	criminal			david duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in californication the troubled talent . and it is a role he plays well . this thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end . timothy hutton plays a fine villain and angelina jolie pouts . the story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted . drug addiction and a desire for the sultry jolie mix a heady cocktail . unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the fbi is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene . but , that aside , a movie worth seeing .
2			strength	real	point	disappointed	effects	special	sequel	creative	point	weakest	movie	original	piece	solid	vampires	entertaining	cloth	erotic	note	personal	horrormovie	sensitive	way	similar	cinema	eager	performance	good	job	great	muertos	good			almost too well done . john carpenter's vampires was entertaining , a solid piece of popcorn entertainment with a budget small enough not to be overrun by special effects . and obviously aiming on the from dusk till dawn audience . vampires los muertos tries the same starting with a rock star jon bon jovi playing one of the main characters , but does that almost too well . i haven not seen jon bon jovi in any other movie , so i am not able to compare his acting in vampires los muertos to his other roles , but i was really suprised of his good performance . after the movie started he convinced me not expecting him to grab any guitar and playing it my life or something , but kill vampires , showing no mercy and doing a job which has to be done . this means a lot , because a part of the audience also me was probably thinking because he's a rockstar . of course bon jovi is not james woods but to be honest it could have been much worse , and in my opinion bon jovi did a very good performance . the vampiress played by arly jover is not the leather dressed killer machine of a vampire leader we met in part 1 or in similar way in ghosts of mars . jover plays the vampire very seductive and very sexy , moving as lithe as a cat , attacking as fast as a snake and dressed in thin , light almost transparent very erotic cloth . and even the optical effects supporting her kind of movement are very well made . it really takes some beating . but the director is in some parts of the film only just avoiding turning the movie from an action horrorfilm into a sensitive horrormovie like murnau's nosferatu . you can almost see the director's temptation to create a movie with a very personal note and different to the original . this is the real strength of the movie and at the same time its weakest point the audience celebrating the fun bloodbath of the first movie is probably expecting a pure fun bloodbath for the second time and might be a little disappointed . make no mistake vampires los muertos is a fun bloodbath but it's just not all the time this kind of movie . just think of the massacre in the bar compared to the scene in which the vampiress tries to seduce zoey in the ruins the bar massacre is what you expect from american popcorn entertainment , the seducing zoey in the ruins scene is almost european like cinema the movie is eager to tell us more about the relationship between zoey and the vampiress , but refuses answers at the same time . because it would had slow down the action ? showed the audience a vampiress with a human past , a now suffering creature and not only a beast which is just slaughtering anybody . and that's the point to me which decides whether the movie is accepted by the audience of the original movie or not . and also is the from dusk till dawn audience really going to like this ? i m not sure about that . nevertheless tommy lee wallace did really a great job , vampires los muertos is surprisingly good . but i also think to direct a sequel of a popcorn movie wallace is sometimes almost too creative , too expressive . like he's keeping himself from developing his talent in order to satisfy the expectations of audience . in my opinion , wallace talent fills the movie with life and is maybe sometimes sucking it out at the same time . vampires los muertos is almost too well done . i give it 7 of 10
2			it	strange	deal	great	schemes	visual	coincidence	great	outcome	logical	fan	great no	stuff	real	script	best	fantasy	true	directions	different	looks	ugly	thing	natural	it	tight			the opening flourishes left me purring with delight at their inventiveness the altered version of the archers logo , the introductory disclaimer , the way the camera pans over the cosmos . it's strange to think that `it's a wonderful life came out in the same year . no great coincidence the 1940 was awash with heaven and earth films ; but the glowing cotton wool nebulas and cutesy angels of the competition look tattered , something best passed over in silence , when placed next to alfred junge's vision . it continues to look great all the way through , as more and more striking ideas are sprung upon us . i m not a great fan of mixing colour with black and white in general . one of the two visual schemes almost always looks ugly when placed next to the other . not so here . powell dissolves colour into monochrome and monochrome into colour as if it's the most natural thing in the world , a mere change of palettes . both the colour photography and the black and white could stand on their own . as for the story . this may be pressburger's best script , or at least it would have been had the conclusion been a more logical outcome of preceding events . other than that it's tight , yet with more going on than i can possibly allude to here . was the heavenly stuff real or imaginary ? or both ? perhaps carter dreamt up a fantasy that was , as it so happened , true . everyone says we are meant to neither ask nor answer this question , but i don not see why . i m sure we are meant to ask the question . the film even gives us clues as to what the answer is indeed , the problem is that there are too many clues and they seem at first to be pointing in different directions . the fact that other things ought to occupy our attention as well doesn not mean that this shouldn not occupy us as well . there is , as i have said before , a lot going on . consider the scene in which abraham farlan heaven's prosecuting lawyer plays a radio broadcast of a cricket match , and contemptuously says , `the voice of england , 1945 dr reeves the defence acknowledges the exhibit with a great deal of embarrassment , and then produces one of his own a blues song from america , which farlan listens to as though he's got a lemon in his mouth . reeves looks smug . snobbery ? well , i don not see why it's snobbish to condemn blues music and that's not what powell and pressburger are doing , anyway . as the song is being played , we get a shot of the american soldiers listening to it several of them nod their heads to the rhythm , perfectly at home . they don not find it incomprehensible . there's something valuable about the song and neither reeves nor farlan knows what it is . reeves probably realises as much . all english audiences and all australian , indian , etc audiences as well know without being told that there is something of value in the cricket broadcast , too ; and that while reeves understands that , he is unable to explain it to farlan hence the blues broadcast , which shows that people can understand each other without sharing an understanding of everything else . it's a clever scene . one last thing . i found david niven a bit cold , without the charisma he would acquire later in his career ; but even so , i don not think a film has grabbed my heart quite so quickly after the action began , as this one did .
2			film	superb	steps	melodramatic	canvas	poetic			like his earlier film , in a glass cage , agust villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor . this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see . the heightened drama , intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical , yet never steps into it . in that way , it pulls off an almost impossible feat to be so over the top and yet so painfully restrained , to be so charged and yet so understated , and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye . unabashed , gorgeous , and highly tense . this film is simply superb !

2			cast	exceptional	result	different	lago	young	york	new	lighting	sensitive	youngster	old	war	civil	friend	best	matter	new no	score	musical	journey	complete			some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing . such is the case for carol's journey el viaje de carol , a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel a boca de noche by ngel garca roldn who also adapted the book as a screenplay . war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films , but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters especially children who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults , the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre . carol clara lago is a 12 year old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora mara barranco returns to her aurora's home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war , a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio lvaro de luna since his wife's death . carol's father robert ben temple is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family . aurora has a past she left her lover alfonso alberto jimnez to marry robert , and alfonso in turn married aurora's cold sister dolores lucina gil . carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her class tomiche juan jos ballesta and his two friends at first resent carol , but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love . when aurora dies of her illness , carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca luna mcgill , yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother's best friend and teacher maruja the always radiant rosa maria sard to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side . through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults , facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime . the ending , though sad , is uplifting as carol's journey to maturity is complete . the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting by cinematographer gonzalo berridi and enhanced by the musical score by bingen mendizbal . director imanol uribe understands the fine line separating pathos from bathos , and in electing to concentrate the story on the children involved , he makes an even stronger statement about the futility and cruelty of war . the cast is exceptional the stars clearly are young clara lago and juan jos ballesta , but they are supported by the fine veteran actors in the adult roles . this is a visually stunning work with a lasting message and should find a much larger audience than it has to this date . grady harp

1			value	appropriate	movie	bad	movie	entire	value	low	it	realistic			yes , this movie is bad . what's worse is that it takes no advantage whatsoever of its own title ! in the entire movie , zombies and vampires fight each other once or twice . on top of that , we are never really sure if the main character in the movie is definitely a vampire . one might argue they were trying to tone it down or make it realistic , but it ends up just boring . more than half of this movie takes place in a car . the scenes that take place anywhere else aren not much to brag about , either . also , there's no clear antagonist , and in the end you have no idea what really happened for the last 30 minutes of the movie . however , i will say that for a film this low in production value , the soundtrack was surprisingly appropriate and instrumented with either an origonal score or sampled music from elsewhere . i m all for independent films , but it doesn not look like this was ever intended for a mass audience if any . worse than scarecrow slayer .

1			garb	eccentric	garb	attractive			i love watching early colour films you mean those 40 clothes weren not all grey ? margaret rutherford dominates this movie . her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes , she has an amazing hourglass figure . but i feel she was given her head rather too much . she probably developed this characterisation over many performances , and nobody told her if it gets a laugh , leave it out . she does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth . the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery . arcati behaves like a retired headmistress we will really put our backs into it ! the contrast between her breezy , commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn not really brought out . just because all the actors are english apart from cummings , the americans feel they have to use the words brit , stiff , lip and upper . oh , give it a rest ! the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqu remarks did he make love to you ? yes , but very discreetly he was in the cavalry !

1			point	positive	seems	appropriate	woman	young	effects	special	budget	low	dad	good	i	stunned	score	musical	secret	unexpected	films	low	grace	potential	acting	flat			i just finished dark chamber aka under surveillance and i m stunned . stunned , not by the film , but by some of the rave reviews i perused which influenced my watching it . the story was so ravaged by plot holes and the majority of the acting so flat , categorizing it as a comedy seems appropriate . seriously , i found myself shaking my head and laughing in bewilderment as i endured this movie . justin leaves the confines of living at home with a pain killer addicted mom to go live with his cop father despite mom's warnings that dad is no good . when a young woman is found murdered , justin becomes suspicious of the tenants who reside in the adjacent apartments . with the help of a couple pals , he installs covert cameras to keep tabs on these folks . as the truth begins to unravel , justin uncovers an unexpected secret . one positive point is that felissa rose is hot ! i would have generously slapped an extra star or two on here had she peeled down a bit , but no such luck . it would have been the film's potential saving grace . eric conley played justin very adeptly , i thought , and i wouldn not be surprised whatsoever to see more of him in the future . the general premise of the film , although plagued by clichs , might possibly have worked had it not been for the ridiculously hollow performances of key cast members , most notably alexandra eitel kayla and david rigg justin's father . the horror ! pardon the pun . i have nothing against low budget fil ms indeed , i believe independent film is our only hope for decent film making in the days to come . i will cut low budget films quite a bit of slack when it comes to special effects , lighting , even musical score and the overall picture quality . i don not give allowances , however , for stick figure acting and a swiss cheese lover's script . there are a vast number of competently made low budget films out there . sadly , this isn not one of them . i can not help but suspect that at least a few of the reviewers who have praised dark chamber here are in some way affiliated with its production .

1			disaster	biggest	slap	bad	cast	good	cast	great	everything	terrible			everything about this film was terrible . to start with this film had a pretty good cast and i find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever . the sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy . it had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating . please please please please please do not inflict yourself with this disaster you will only be hurt

1			movies	worst			i have seen over 1000 movies and this one stands out as one of the worst movies that i have ever seen . it is a shame that they had to associate this garbage to the angels 1963 song my boyfriend's back . if you have to make a choice between watching this movie and painful dental work , i would suggest the dental work .

1			fans	die	goya	hilarious	fans	hard			this has been put out on the dvd market by alpha , and it's for die hard boris karloff fans like moi only . it's not a horror flick , but a drama where boris is a struggling scientist agreeing to kill a wealthy woman's husband in order to gain the fortune needed to continue with his work . but once the dying victim changes his will and leaves his spouse nothing , all hell breaks loose . it's appeasing enough seeing karloff as another selfish sinister type , and some of the acting is unintentionally hilarious especially from the leading lady mona goya who is absolutely a laugh riot as the double crossed wife . but proceed with much caution .

1			bore	horrible	jumbo	new	direction	inspired no	prochnow	bad	chatter	new	driver	new	problem	global			i must admit i do not hold much of new age mumbo jumbo . when people exchange energy i always wonder how much kj is actually exchanged and how it may contribute to solving the global warming problem . when energy is enforced i always wonder how they managed to violate the laws of entropy and still are without nobel prizes . when people feel how well instinct enables them to flawlessly navigate through the complexities of life i wonder how they fail to do a simple thing like finding the train station . but then again , this is not the first movie with plot holes and most of them i find perfectly acceptable and entertaining . if this were the case with the celestine prophecy i wouldn not burn this movie down , but unfortunately it isn not . every actor seems to be bored out of his head and unable to grasp what he are actually supposed to be doing on location . this results in many ah s and oh s , like i tend to do when talking about quantum physics with somebody who actually knows what he is talking about and pretend to understand . the direction is uninspired as well . you might expect something more from the guy who did what dreams may come , but hey , i supposed he got well paid for the job and adopted the attitude of a new york taxi driver it's your money , buddy . the only one who seems to be having fun is all time bad guy jrgen prochnow . not only does he have a job , he is one of the few actors in this movie who may have a few wise cracks at this eternal and terribly boring new age chatter . this movie is much like one of these dinner dates when you find out that your date is actually a horrible bore who seems to be unable to shut up . at one moment in time it seems the words turn into small ping pong balls that are thrown to your head incessantly until it hurts . if you want to have a good time and have to choose between this movie and sticking safety pins in your eyelids , take my advise choose the latter .
1			she	annoying	seem	confused	scenery	nice	parchment	old			some nice scenery , but the story itself in which a self proclaimed egyptologist lesley anne down visits egypt and , in the course of doing egyptologist things in the most un egyptologistic of ways for example , flash photography in the tombs , the handling of old parchment , etc , uncovers a black market turf war and somehow in the span of two days , no less ! becomes that war's jumpsuit wearing epicenter is more puzzling than any riddle the sphinx ever posed . down is simply awful as the visiting british scholar that she seems to know absolutely nothing about the culture of egypt and even less about antiquities is the fault of the writers , certainly ; but that she's annoying as all get out is her own fault entirely , and the rest of the cast , including sir john gielgud and frank langella , seem as downright confused by the proceedings as i was . in short , not what you would expect from schaffner planet of the apes , patton and co . worth watching for a laughably dated scene in which down rails against all male scholars , blaming them for her failure as an academic , while bathed under the softest light hollywood could muster . to top it off , she spends the next hour of the film shrieking and harried and running into the arms of any dude she can find . wow , talk about your performative irony ! note to would be egyptologists take a year or two of arabic in grad school . it will really help out in the long run .

1			mary	little	b	little	she	cute	fix	old	backside	little	budget	low	looks	good	mary	cute	productions	great no	it	worth	productions	choppy	rascals	little			this early john wayne lone star western has a bit more going for it than the run of the mill oaters wayne had been making for lone star up until that time . for one , it has his old friend paul fix in it ; fix , being a much better actor then the standard lone star villain , brings a much needed professionalism to the surroundings instead of the usual hesitant line readings often delivered in these oaters . the plot , about mistaken identity , payroll robbery and murder , is as trite and perfunctory as you would expect it to be in a 1930 low budget western , but wayne's strapping good looks , easygoing charm and way with a line go a long way to making this more enjoyable . plump , balding eddy chandler isn not quite believable as wayne's womanizing partner , and there's a running gag about something that happens whenever chandler and wayne are about to get into a fistfight that grows tiresome . on the other hand , wayne's love interest is played by none other than mary kornman , the little mary of the early little rascals fame . she is a grown up 20 year old now , blonde and cute as a button . most of wayne's leading ladies in these lone star / monogram b's were fairly bland and colorless , but mary is perky , cute and , yes , sexy . there's a scene in the general store , where she works , in which wayne asks her to get him a bottle of nerve tonic , which happens to be on the top shelf , so she has to get a ladder and climb up to the top shelf . wayne's ogling her pert little backside as she ascends the steps , then again as she comes down , then again a few minuter later when he asks her to climb up and get him another bottle is surprisingly racy for a film made in 1935 wayne makes no attempt to hide the fact that he is definitely checking out her butt . anyway , it's an interesting little b , not great , but not as choppy and random as many of his lonestar productions of the time . the final gunfight isn not handled all that well , and chandler gets somewhat irritating after a while , but all in all , it's worth a look , if only to see a cute and sexy mary kornman .
1			jolts	nasty	effects	special	dey	young	tone	dead	tone	serious	concept	imaginative			not as bad , as it's credited to being hooper's done far worse more so disappointing for me . such an imaginative concept , which is never really tapped in to by hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky excuse the pun writing . it goes so sinister and over the top in a dead serious tone , becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt . because of that , the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and brad dourif cool to see him in a leading role seems to struggle with an off balanced performance , despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off colour character . even though it's cheaply done , there's a competent technical attitude to it . however it doesn not seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts which some do work and strikingly steaming special effects flames , flames everywhere instead . hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery more so towards the latter end , and the camera work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating . the performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of william prince , cynthia bain , dey young , jon cypher and melinda dillon . also geroge buck flower and john landis have small , but amusing cameos especially landis . nothing surprises , but it's passably engaging .

1			girl	happy	plot	real			wow . i don not even really remember that much about this movie , except that it stunk . the plot's basically ; a girl's parents neglect her , so this sicko pokemon pretends to be her dad . am i the only one disturbed by that ? then , this weirdo pokemon kidnaps ash's mom to pretend to be the girl's . i don not care if he was trying to make the girl happy , that's just gross . there was no real plot . the girl was just a whiny brat who wanted things her own way . she played with unowns , was the daughter of entei and apparently could grow and shrink in age on a whim with the help of her dad . that's pretty much all i can remember , but i think you can take it as a hint , and not see it . or if you do see it , don not expect much . 1 out of 10 seriously . if you want a pokemon movie , rent pokemon ; the first movie .
1			shakespeare	bad	singing	amateurish	comedy	bad	you	wise	lane	mistaken	numbers	musical	he	hysterical	comedy	musical			kenneth branagh attempts to turn william shakspeare's obscure , rarely produced comedy into a 1930 era musical , with the result being both bad shakespeare and bad musical comedy as the actors are rarely adept at one or the other of the two styles and in some cases flounder badly in both . particularly painful is nathan lane , who seems to be under the impression that he is absolutely hysterical as costard but is badly mistaken , and alicia silverstone who handles the shakespearean language with all the authority of a teenaged valley girl who is reading the script aloud in her middle school english class . the musical numbers are staged with the expertise of a high school production of dames at sea , leaving the cast looking awkward and amateurish while singing and dancing , with the lone exception being adrian lester who proves himself a splendid song and dance man . the only other saving grace of the film are natascha mcelhone and emily mortimer's contribution as eye candy , but they have given far better performances than in this film and you would be wise to check out some of the other titles in their filmographies and gives this witless mess a pass .
1			comedy	easy	fate	pleasant no	it	hard	open	glamorous	matelot	traditional	lady	young	she	happy	it	forgettable	status	due			the name cult movie is often given to films which continue to be screened , or to sell in home movie format , more than a generation after they were first released . superchick , which was first released in 1973 now comes into this category . its cult status is largely due to ongoing interest in it by those women who regard it as an early and effective feminist film . despite the superwoman connotation , superchick is not a cartoon character but a very competent young lady working as an air stewardess a career option which in the 1970 s was commonly regarded as one of the most glamorous open to any girl , and which also enables her to emulate the traditional matelot who reputedly has a wife in every port . since she holds black belt status in karate , she is in a position to make it quite clear that she is very happy with her bachelor existence , and is in no way beholden to any of her extensive suite of male admirers . this film is a situation comedy which avoids the generally much shorter lived appeal of outright farce . its appeal to feminists is also heightened by a climax in which our heroine uses her karate abilities to avert a hijacking and save all the other passengers on her plane from a potentially unpleasant fate . to ensure that this film will appeal to men as well as to their partners , the director has wisely ensured that is liberally sprinkled with eye candy . superchick can be enjoyed by those who are not too critical and want a very light easy to watch comedy which they will forget soon after viewing . it is so forgettable that they will probably find it equally enjoyable if watched again in a year's time ; despite its age it may therefore retain its status as a cult movie for some time to come . however the dialogue and acting would make it hard to give this film a rating of more than 4 10
1			it	boring			i don not know how to describe this movie . it's definitely one of the weirdest movies i have seen in a long time . it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places . the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore & splatter . i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes . the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling . the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone . but if you are a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for . if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment , give it a try ! my rating 4 10 maybe a little too weird for my taste

because , she apparently was the joke . just like john huston , john carradine , grady sutton , andy devine and other veteran performers in the film , they are there only so the film can mock their age and use them to trash their film images . they are cast as smarmy self parodies , as is rex reed , the arrogant , fey film critic , who is cast as just that in the film . but the real reed , the celebrity hound , jet setting , talk show gossip , can be charming in an obnoxiously funny way ; but as myron , myra's alter ego , he is just obnoxious . again , apparently for sarne , reed is the joke . you watch myra breckinridge and you don not see actors , you see victi ms none more so than raquel welch . no one will ever accuse welch of being a great actress , but it is a testament to her tenacity and her appeal that she survived this film and her career prospered . being in almost every scene , welch was front and center as a target for abuse aimed at the film , but to her credit , she gives a remarkably nuanced performance . though , of course , centered between the scenery chewing huston and the almost catatonic west , welch doesn not have to do much to strike a good balance . even so , she renders her horribly unfunny dialogue with a deadpan smirk , with just the hint of self righteous glee that would do any james bond villain proud . legend has it that welch was snubbed by a condescending west and subjected to repeated verbal abuse on the set by bumbling director sarne , not to mention being featured in one degrading scene after another , making it all the more remarkable that she was able to give such a cool and collected performance . the film's only intriguing element is trying to figure out just what the film's agenda is . the whole story is a fantasy fable , which should indicate that it has a moral to deliver , but what that might be is anybody's guess . with all of its talk about destroying the last vestigial traces of traditional manhood from the race , it would seem to have a feminist axe to grind . but as a feminist , myra is a monstrous figure , a sexual predator . besides , myra isn not a woman , rather she is a delusion of myron , who presumably is a gay male . that might explain the male rape scene as well as the character's love / hate attitude toward the macho , seemingly straight , deadhead rusty , but it doesn not explain his / her obsession for and the supposedly lesbian tryst with farrah fawcett's mary ann . the film is obsessed with sex , but can hardly be accused of being in favor of the sexual revolution ; all the sex is treated as being , if not dirty , than at least perverse and degrading . turning to gore vidal's original novel isn not of any help , because it is as confused and pointless as the movie . and this is a rare movie that actually seems to hate movies . not just movies as a business , but movies as part of the culture as well . the film itself is wall to wall arcane references to old movies , all of which director screenwriter sarne approaches with a seething disdain . he has raided the film vaults of 20 h century fox and peppered the film with snippets of old films , not as an homage or to provide a social commentary , but to mock the innocence of old hollywood . how can an artist if you generously want to call sarne that make a work of art if he already hates the very medium he is working in ? the very effort is totally self defeating . myra breckinridge doesn not seem to be in favor of anything other than being just nasty . it hates hollywood , it hates america , it hates sex , it hates gays and straights and women and men and old people and young people and laurel and hardy and , well , you name it and it probably has a scene showing contempt for it . in a very sad and sorry way , myra breckinridge may be the first punk manifesto , a celebration of pop culture nihilism .
1			suv	modern	acting	horrible	movie	bad			. oh wait , i can ! this movie is not for the typical film snob , unless you want to brush up on your typical cinematic definitions , like continuity editing and geographic match . i couldn not tell where i was in this movie . one second they are in the present , next minute their supposedly in the 70 s driving a modern suv and wearing what looked like to me as 80 s style clothing . i think . i couldn not pay long enough attention to it since the acting was just horrible . i think it only got attention because it has a 3 which i did not watch . if you are a b movie buff , and by b movie i mean bad movie , then this film is for you . it's home movie and all non sense style will keep you laughing for as long as you can stay awake . if your tastes are more for goddard and antonioni , though , just skip this one .

1			acting	passable	effects	special	it	bad	story	magical	story	interesting	understatement	great	story	spiritual			the wrinkle in time book series is my favorite series from childhood . i have read and re read them more times than i can count over the last 35 years . the characters , with all their virtues and flaws , are near and dear to my heart . this adaptation contained very little of the wonderful , magical , spiritual story that i love so much . to say i was disappointed with this film would be a great understatement . if you have never read the book s i imagine you will enjoy the movie . the acting is passable , the special effects are well done for a made for tv movie , and the story is interesting . however , if you love the books , avoid this movie at all costs . i found this statement at the wikipedia page of the novel in an interview with newsweek , l engle said of the film , i expected it to be bad , and it is . i , like another reviewer here , feel the need to read the book again to dispel this movie from my mind .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			this film has the look and feel of a student film project . yeah , there are some interesting albeit gimmicky edits and shots , but the end result was juvenile . the director didn not seem to be saying look at this film . it seemed as if he were saying , look at me ! i m a director ! thumbs down .
1			show	ridiculous	look	ridiculous			power rangers , the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990 , has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created . what exactly is the point of this show anyway , other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children ? there is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway . look at the costumes , which look like spandex gone bad . the mullet style hair , earrings , and fashions of the early 1990 look completely ridiculous these days . avoid this show at all costs !
1			play	excellent	views	beautiful	sense	real	book	important	play	awesome			i didn not like this film at all ! first of all , i don not know why , but everyone here says , that clmence posy's play is excellent , which in my opinion is absolutely wrong ! she is not like natasha another appearance , another character . what's worse , she is a very unexperienced actress and that's why she wasn not able to play this role ! she disfigured the heroine completely ! that was really disgusting to watch her play ! to my mind , that would be much better to give this role to a russian actress , because that would be much easier for her to understand the russian soul for a russian person . unfortunately , kutuzov looked like a drunk man , who hasn not shaved 2 weeks and defeated a battle in which he lost his eye . thank's god , in this film there are some actors , whose play was awesome ! i suppose , that alessio boni coped with his task very well ! i was pleasantly amazed ! he is one of the few people who's read the book , which is very important for the play . in addition , i liked plays of our russian actors , that was really wonderful to watch them the only thing i liked in this work was very beautiful views and amazing dresses ! my advice is to read the book and to understand a real sense , the aim , with which leo tolstoy wrote this masterpiece , and maybe realize the whole idea of the book . 1 from 10
1			twist	ridiculous	chair	old			a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro life and the other a destroyer of a demon's seed . the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific , but , instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death , despite the title itself . being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning , this ridiculous plot twist with it's sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon . i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go , never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to the end .
1			guy	nice	conventions	low	attacks	bad			yep . this is definatly up there with some of the worst of the mstifyed movies , but i have definately seen worse . think gremlins rated well anyway , i met rick sloane at some sci fi convention , that amazingly , he was lecturing at ! it was one of those really low budget conventions , where everything goes , an everyone brought in something if you want to see crap , you should have of seen what some friends and i brought in . he seemed like a very nice guy , he was very cool about my questions and comments on hobgoblins , and he even told me not to take it seriously , and said he loved the mst 3 version ! all in all , rick sloane knew what he was doing . and i think was meant to bad like mars attacks . so i guess i m standing up for this movie and giving it a 5 and betraying all my fellow msties . sorry guys .
1			start	nice	mother	single	movie	intentional no	tezuka	famous	holiday	famous	it	hard	seem	annoying	story	romantic	film	suitable	girl	old	book	comic	artist	comic	it	illogical	concept	nice	interview	live	relationship	young	story	original	sketches	nice	version	modern			it is hard to describe this film and one wants to tried hard not to dismiss it too quickly because you have a feeling that this might just be the perfect film for some 12 years old girl . this film has a nice concept the modern version of sleeping beauty with a twi st it has some rather dreamy shots and some nice sketches of the young boy relationship with his single working mother and his schoolmate . a nice start you might say , but then it got a bit greedy , very greedy , it tries to be a science fiction , a drama , a thriller , a possible romantic love story , fairy tale , a comedy and everything under the sun . the result just left the audience feeling rather inadequate . for example , the scene when the girl played by risa goto finally woken by his yuki kohara kiss , instead of being romantic , it try's to be scary in order to make us laugh afterwards . it is a cheap trick , because it ruin all the anticipation and emotion which it was trying to build for the better half of the film . i have not read the original story the film is base on it is the well known work by the comic book artist osamu tezuka is famous with his intriguing and intricate stories i wonder if all the problems exsist in the original story or did it occur in the adaption ? it is rather illogical even for someone who is used to the fussy logic of those japanese comic book . for instance , how did yuki kohara's character manage to get to the hospital in an instant when its suppose to be a long bus ride away to run away risa goto's character in front of the tv cameras right after he saw her live interview on the television ? there are also some scenes that is directly copied very uncreative ! from other films and they all seem rather pointlessly annoying ie . the famous the lion mouth has caugh my hand scene from the roman holiday the film tries to be everything but ends up being nothing . it fails to be a fairy tale and it did not have enough jokes to be a comedy . and strangely there are some scenes that even seem like an unintentional ghost movie . nevertheless , one should give it credit that it has managed to caputured some of the sentiment of the japanese teenager . it is by watching this film i have a feeling that there might be some films that should have come with a warning label that said this film might only be suitable for person under the 18 of age , it would have definitly been on the poster of this film .

1			context	cultural	jewish	cynical	loss	complete	monde	radical	she	interesting			i don not give much credence to aids conspiracy theories but its sociologically interesting to see the phenomenon dramatized . in the early years of the aids epidemic , the suffering and paranoia of the scared and dying often generated such dark fantasies . this was especially true in the politically radical and sexually extreme demi monde of san francisco . the city , renowned for its beauty , has rarely appeared uglier than in this film . a sense of darkness and decomposition pervades every scene . while the acting and plot can not be said to be well done the films unique cultural context and oppressively dark mood at least partly saves the film from being a complete loss . actually , i found the most interesting performance to be irit levi as a crusty and cynical jewish , lesbian ? police detective . she's interesting , though not necessarily convincing . highlights the film's use of the garishly tragic turandot is an effective motif and there is a sublime silent cameo by iconic performance artist , ron athey .

1			combat	impressive	locales	exotic	stereotypes	social	accents	french	impact	watchable			normally , i don not like revenge fil ms . period . but double impact has a little more than your typical revenge plot premise . you see , di has action , accuracy , exotic locales that is , hong kong , awesome gun battles , and enough martial arts to satisfy your cravings for impressive unarmed combat . like all revenge flicks , it has villains you would love to throw out of a plate glass window on the top floor of a 40 story building ! however , double impact has none of the sensationalist crap that suffocates the plot and the elitist , racist , and venomous social stereotypes that invaded eye for an eye and death wish 2 . but in the plot department double impact is as transparent as saran wrap . chad and alex's parents were killed by a mob hit squad connected to a family friend with money problems or at least that's what i remembered . the explanation of why the boys were talking in french accents is a lousy one . it wasn not the watery plot that made this movie bad , but the use of clichd lines and moves from other movies from lethal weapon to the princess bride really made it worse . but nonetheless double impact is still watchable . but why is that shitty movies like this have villains for example , that greedy british guy that killed chad and alex's parents and that lethal lesbian redhead chick you would love to hate with fiber of your being ?
1			movie	good	i	frustrated	result	frustrating	lives	empty	characters	weak			i understand what this movie was trying to portray . how the old are often ignored and treated like a bother , which means they end up feeling unappreciated and like their lives are empty . i do not have a problem with this message , but i just feel that it could have been put across in a way that is not so painful to watch . i enjoy a good art movie but when a movie becomes too self consciously arty as in this case the result is often frustrating . including shots of a person packing a suitcase slowly that take 5 minutes try to make a point but just end up annoying the audience . the female characters are very weak and you end up wanting to just tell them to pull it together . this is a movie you feel you should enjoy or rate highly and certainly has its merits but i was just too frustrated watching it to ever recommend it to someone else . it might have a deeper message than other roger michell movies for example notting hill but at least that was a movie you could enjoy watching .

1			movie	good	editing	worst	editing	poor	acting	poor			i only rented this movie because of promises of william dafoe , and robert rodriguez . i assumed that upon seeing rr's name on the cover as an actor that this movie would be good . it sounds like a movie that rodriguez would of made so if he's going to lend his name to it , than it has to be good right ? wrong wrong wrong . by far the worst editing since manos hands of fate . the way it was edited made no sense and made the movie impossible to follow and after the first 30 minutes you wont even want to try to follow it anymore . i have no idea how dafoe and rodriguez got involved in this film , maybe they owed somebody , but they are way to good for this . besides they were only in this movie for a couple minutes apiece and rodriguez didn not even talk . so if you wanna see a movie with poor editing , poor acting , and confusing storyline than be my guest but don not say you weren not warned .
1			it	terrible	it	bad	it	fake			how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long ? it's terrible . it makes me want to shoot someone . it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940 sci fi movie . i would rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense . i remember watching it when it first came out . i thought , hey this could be interesting , then i found out how absolutely , insanely , ridiculously stupid it really was . it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table . please people , stop watching this and all other reality shows , they are the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create .

1			dogs	believable no	bride	new	drunks	local			this film reminded me so much of a history of violence which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence . dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble . don not these men have a job ? anyway , dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone , feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap . funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it . sam peckinpah who made the wild bunch which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which no one was spared . but it was done with style , and you believed it . straw dogs is not believable . first of all the location is wrong and does not work . why place it in england ? i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930 s or something . second it is not in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife . sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one .
1			effects	special	review	good	reviewer	previous	improvement	noticeable no	development	believable	classic	true	dvd	new	novel	classic			i notice that the previous reviewer who appears to be still at school gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn not seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel . the major problem i had with this 1999 version was the casting of anthony way as tom long . anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini series the choir . i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in the choir . unfortunately the small boy who appeared in the choir had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time tom's midnight garden was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom . it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom as played by anthony would befriend the far younger hatty . in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable . for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects . the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic . as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over 20.00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under 5.00 need i say more ?
1			way	worst	information	little	hokum	new	offenders	worst	pretentious	heavy	t	new	information	good			this movie made me very angry . i wanted desperately to throttle the scientists and unseen film makers during the course of it . very , very painful to sit through . sophomoric and pretentious in the worst way . the little good information on brain function / chemistry and quantum theory is lost in a sea of new agey horse sh t . the worst offenders were the crack pot charlatans ramtha and joseph dispenza . mr dispenza informs us that most people lead lives of mediocrity and clearly implies that he , on the other hand , is living on a higher plane . even the ideas and attitudes that i basically agree with are presented in such a heavy handed , clumsy , superior , pretentious , preachy manner that i felt the desire to disavow them . i think that's what made me so angry , the fact that they have taken what are indeed profound aspects of established scientific thought and marred them with their new age hokum . much of it is based around the fallacy of applying concepts of quantum theory to the macro world . fittingly , the dramatized portions with marlee matlin are amateurish and clich ridden . i would refer people instead to bill bryson's excellent survey of science a brief history of nearly everything . there's plenty of profound wonder about life and the universe in the actual , established science .
1			adaptation	poor	silent	dead	attention	great	series	original	performance	understated	evil	original			this was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original . the brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over the top histrionics of the american version . the original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings . i have watched the series many times and am still enthralled . just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of cracker . get hooked up with bbc america or bbc canada and watch for such delights as waking the dead , spooks , silent witness , and judge john deed . watch the original touching evil , then look for wire in the blood for more of the truly understated , elegant performance of robson green . hollywood needs to have a look at this actor !
1			bullies	shocking	show	hate	show	racist			anyone notice that tommy only has 3 facial expressions . 1 the angry eyes look he gives every enemy . 2 the holding of the hands to face , mouth agape and frightened eyes . 3 the smiling tommy turnbull . i have to say that i pretty much hate this show , i don not watch it but it's like code lyoko , we have all watched at least one , i must say that this show is borderline racist , uninteresting and pointless . every episode ends with robotboy winning , except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack . the jokes are pretty crude too , i think it's mostly people saying the word suck or farting , i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too . isn not there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate , and the other uses a chain , for god sake , what kind of school is he going to . not to mention his older brother , who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities . the whole show i feel is ripping off megas xlr and fosters . like you could say the trio of coop , jamie and kiva , as well as robotboy being similar to megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he's free spirited despite being a robot . there is simply no appeal to this show , i m surprised that it's still running .
1			speeches	emotional	ferret	funny	film	predictable	things	new	it	easy	friend	best	screenplays	funny no	something	funny no	lisa	new			this film offers absolutely no imagination in it's premise nor in it's execution but these are just two things that come to mind after watching this so called comedy that has no energy to speak of . story is about nit picky over analytical insurance risk manager reuben feffer ben stiller who finds his new wife lisa debra messing cheating on him with a scuba instructor hank azaria after only one day on their honeymoon . upon returning home reuben and his best friend sandy philip seymour hoffman go to a party and run into polly prince jennifer aniston whom they went to school with years earlier . spoiler alert polly is forgetful and sloppy and lives carefree which is the opposite of who reuben is as a person but they start to date and reuben starts to change as a person as he starts to try out new things such as salsa dancing and eating spicy foods . but one day lisa comes back and wants to remain married to reuben but he really doesn not want to but polly decides to leave as she doesn not believe in marriage to begin with . this film is the second directing effort by john hamburg who wrote two generally unfunny screenplays in zoolander and meet the parents but those two films seem like classics compared to this stale piece of drivel . it's very easy to say something is not funny but i think with this film it's even easier to figure out why . this film is totally and utterly predictable from start to finish with every scene looking as if it's only happening because of the ridiculousness of the script . hamburg who also wrote the script seems to have written this without any thought of trying something different and at times he seems to be trying to generate the same energy as there's something about mary but instead the events seem incredibly forced . did anyone really think the blind ferret was funny ? if you do , your easy ! a few times during the film characters would inexplicably have these emotional speeches that are supposed to summarize everything but all they achieve is overstating the obvious . stiller works a lot but maybe he should work less and just wait for the better scripts to come his way because this film doesn not work as a comedy or as a romance .
1			sense	naive	i	disappointed	i	old	man	incredible	movie	worst	story	incoherent			many moons ago when i was seven years old , i can vaguely remember seeing a trailer for this movie . it appealed to my naive sense of curiosity and i decided to ask my parents to take me to this movie . being the wise adults that they are , they told me absolutely not ! it's a bunch of trash . of course , i was very disappointed that i would not be the first kid on my block to see the incredible melting man . little time passed maybe a couple of days . i forgot about the incredible melting man and my disappointment faded . twenty five years passed until it re entered the forefront of my thoughts . while surfing through channels on digital cable , i found this long lost relic of a movie . my curiosity was piqued and i decided to finally partake in this fruit forbidden by my parents . i should have listened to them . the incredible melting man is perhaps the worst movie known to man . it makes movies such as def con 4 metalstorm , and freddie got fingered look like oscar nominees . i feel violated for wasting almost two hours of my life watching this vile filth . the story was incoherent and the effects were crude even for 1977 how anyone convinced a film company to produce this movie beyond me . don not make the same mistake that i did . listen to your parents if they forbade you to watch this movie . they were right .

1			film	least	acid	bad	decisions	usual no	waste	total			what is it ? is a mish mash of bizarre recurring motifs snails , shirley temple , swastikas , and overtly racist music , among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development . the whole thing struck me as self consciously freak show , and i don not mean only the unusual casting decisions . it has the feel of a bad acid trip , far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to hunter thompson or william burroughs . the only movie to which i can compare it is eraserhead my second least favorite film of all time , which was by intent much more depressing , but i still found what is it ? a total waste of my time . it's one thing to give me a peek into the inner workings of someone else's mind even someone else's chemically altered consciousness but quite another to just throw weird visuals at me purely for the sake of weirdness .
1			it	interesting no	i	sad	she	attractive	life	real			the photography on the dvd is so dark i thought the screen had died . i think i missed seeing half of the movie . still , it was poorly crafted and not interesting . i did not find the story related to the title the black widow . i was hoping for a mystery or a thriller but did not get involved enough to care after the first few frames . i rented the movie especially for willem dafoe and was sad it wasted his talent . i do not believe giada colagrande has studied movie making long enough to develop a major motion picture . she is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie . although they are married in real life , they lack chemistry on the screen . their relationships did not seem believable . i do not understand why the other characters were even introduced into the plot .
1			neighbor	old	family	young	maine	rural	picture	average	element	worst	movie	disturbing	it	memorable			stephen king adaptation scripted by king himself in which a young family , newcomers to rural maine , find out about the pet cemetery close to their home . the father dale midkiff then finds out about the micmac burial ground beyond the pet cemetery that has powers of resurrection only of course anything buried there comes back not quite right . below average horror picture starts out clumsy , insulting , and inept , and continues that way for a while , with the absolute worst element being midkiff's worthless performance . it gets a little better toward the end , with genuinely disturbing finale . in point of fact , the whole movie is really disturbing , which is why i can not completely dismiss it at least it has something to make it memorable . decent supporting performances by fred gwynne , as the wise old aged neighbor , and brad greenquist , as the disfigured spirit victor pascow are not enough to really redeem film . king has his usual cameo as the minister . followed by a sequel also directed by mary lambert is it any wonder that she's had no mainstream film work since ? 4 10
1			film	bad	kitten	gratuitous	effort	poor			i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments but after sitting through most of rankin's dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it ! i couldn not actually make it right to the end , and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs about 1 3 d of the audience after the ragged plot , woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear . this film is all pose and no art . all style and no substance . it is weighed down by dreadful acting , a genuinely dire script , indifferent cinematography and student level production values . how it got funded , started , and finished is a mystery to me . i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release . the proper critics would tear it apart . a really bad film . shockingly bad . a really really really poor effort and that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new born kitten gets dropped into a deep fat fryer moment . totally meaningless , utterly lightweight , poorly put together ; this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema .

1			sequel	atrocious			i have to admit i have caught this one a few times on the usa network . there's just something about the , well , sheer stupidity of this flick which makes me want to watch it whenever it's on . yes , you are right about the sub par acting , the plot which only an seven year old could like , etc but i can not help feeling sympathetic toward some of the actors . then again , a few of these actors signed up for the even more atrocious sequel .
1			merits	great	reappearance	uncanny	occultist	local	it	good	contender	bad no	rd	bad	pilot	miserable	series	entire	reason	good			the only reason the norliss tapes deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the ca st other than getting to see angie baby in a pre police woman performance , there's nothing else worth seeing here . the synopsis minor spoilers david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural . one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger . the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the norliss tapes a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural . in the pilot episode , a wealthy sculptor dies but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death . we soon discover the ring itself doesn not grant immortality . instead , it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse , allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood . blue faced , yellow eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven not heard since you last watched scooby doo cartoons , the sculptor attacks his wife dickinson one dark night . she escapes and , via a mutual acquaintance , contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate . so is this guy a vampire ? number there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or hea rd the sculptor doesn not drink his victims blood he collects it . how ? don not know . we only see him attacking , never collecting . why ? to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality . it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood . once it's finished , sargoth plans to inhabit the statue , using it as his gateway into our world . the final analysis the norliss tapes wasn not picked up as a series for a very good reason . it was garbage . as you can see from my synopsis , the story is a paltry , ill conceived mess . the acting and dialogue offer no better . this isn not even a contender for a so bad it's good awa rd sometimes bad is just bad . after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of the norliss tapes , i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10 15 03 i wish i hadn not set myself up for the fall . having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago , i can only assume any applause you have heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth . or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis . either way , they have offered you misleading reviews of the norliss tapes . pauly orchid october 17 2003

1			idea	great	problems	serious	killer	young	manual	psychological	movies	worst	zodiac	original	way	great	nothing	rational no	touch	nice	movie	worst	it	rare	actors	experienced no	he	active			this is easily the worst movie i have ever seen . i m not exaggerating , i told the guy at blockbuster that they should take it off the shelves . the only thing interesting about this movie is the box . on the box it says from the director of the boogeyman so i whatever , if this was made recently i m sure the directing at least won not be too bad , but after i saw the movie and looked at what boogeyman they were talking about , it's some nonsense from the early 1980 s that he made . great way to rope in unsuspecting viewers . anyway , i think that they just liked the name zodiac killer , and didn not bother to research any of the actual zodiac's crimes or his mo , or even the years that he was active . all of the crimes they talk about have nothing to do with the zodiac and the stories about the original zodiac take place several years after the actual zodiac's crimes did . they also compare the zodiac to vampire of dusseldorf fritz haarman throughout the movie and talk to fritz's son quite often . the zodiac and haarman were nothing alike , and it makes more sense to compare him to btk who also shot people , not a man who killed people by chewing through their necks . none of the haarman facts are correct either , just a bunch of jumbled nonsense . his son even says don not forget , his name was fritz haarman with 2 t's actual name just has one ! i think that the writer / director simply typed in a google search for serial killers and the quickest ones that came up were the zodiac killer and fritz haarman . ooh those sound like cool names , let's make a movie about them without doing any outside research ! great idea ! perhaps my favorite inconsistency in this movie is the way that the experts as well as the young killer describe suffering from dsm iv and getting cured of it . i was also diagnosed with dsm iv and have since recovered , etc for those of you who don not know , dsm iv is the psychological manual for mental disorders . if anybody suffers from the book itself then they must have some serious problems ! haha . anyway , my point is that this goes on the bottom of my top 5 worst movies of all time list , and it's rare that a movie ever reaches that point . but , if you are interested in watching a totally non fact based story about serial killers that happens to be nothing more than boring , full of inexperienced actors , and not completely rational , i would say check out this movie . and i liked how the killer tear gassed a few of his victims with dry ice . nice touch .

1			issue	little	parts	exciting	look	good	sticks	big	possession	demonic			despite the english title , this seems to have little to do with devils and much more to do with a power hungry ruler who seeks the philospher's stone & wants gold made from lead & virgin's blood . jacinto molina plays gilles de lancre and seems to have little issue with having people put to death when he thinks they threaten his position or when he needs virgins for their blood . he's basically egged on by his lady love and an alchemist that he's employed and it's more greed and insanity that seems to be his problem than demonic possession unfortunately . there are parts that are at least somewhat exciting like jousting and grown men trying to knock each other down with big sticks , and the film at least has a good look to it , but otherwise there's little about this to recommend . little in the way of gore and nothing to be afraid of at all , and most unusual , for a molina / naschy film , not really any unintentional humor . therefore , 4 out of 10

1			ending	climatic	character	undeveloped	movies	hate	colors	great	ending	ridiculous	scenery	great	movies	bad	he	bored	clichés	traditional	costumes	great			i basically picked up this movie because i had seen kitano takashi's brilliant remake of zatoichi and was in the mood for another updated samurai tale which also starred asano tadanobu . these two movies are worlds apart . zatoichi added humor and depth to its characters and subverted traditional samurai movie clichs . gojoe goes off the deep end in the other direction . first off , i hate movies that have other characters inform the audience what the main character is like instead of having the character develop over the course of the movie . you cannot decide whether you are a monk or a warrior says almost every character in benkei's presence , yet this inner turmoil is barely conveyed within the character himself . instead of character development , we get bloated , boring , gory battle scenes . asano's character is undeveloped and even he looks like he is bored and doesn not know what he is doing there . i know that he usually looks distant and cool and that is part of asano's appeal , but this movie doesn not serve him . a lot of the camera movement is nauseating . there is a scene that goes on forever in which the camera spins around the main characters until my wife and i felt like vomiting . the ending is ridiculous and rather anti climatic . its too bad that really good samurai movies aren not being made in japan nowadays with this type of budget . the colors , scenery , and costumes were great , but the rest is just a loooong waste of time . i would rather see one of the kabuki versions of this myth .

1			fear	good	one	good	role	entertaining	stars	best			it never ceases to amaze me how you can take an excellent actor , and put him to waste in a film such as this . robert de niro is one of the best hollywood stars of all time , but even he couldn not save this movie . in fact , his character is much the same as the one he played in cape fear , which was actually pretty good , but i can not stand it when actors do the same schtick over more than one movie . i believe it gets old , and that is the case here . there's nothing surprising in this movie , but then , the story has been told a million times before . wesley snipes is your typical baseball player , and his conceit shows through in his characterization . de niro plays the obsessed fan , but his role in this film is less than entertaining . however , because de niro is in this film , that makes it a draw if you are a fan no pun intended who sees everything he does no matter how bad . but to see de niro at his best , see midnight run , goodfellas , or cop land , or even go way back and check out taxi driver or godfather ii . don not waste your time with this drivel . my rating 3 10

1			movie	russian	bar	local			the russian movie , 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar . one is a musician , one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl . 4 i gather , is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post soviet russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are , but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it . there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities , selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here . despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes , 4 is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs .
1			children	infectious	seem	confused	door	dead	things	difficult	it	easy	metal	bad			a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires . the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors . released in 1993 darkness garnered something of a cult following upon release . it's easy to see why it's loaded and i mean freaking loaded with gore , and it's energy and enthusiasm , like that found in other no budget cult horror flicks like the dead next door and the children of ravensback , is actually rather infectious . while that may be true , that's sadly not enough to save it . the film was shot on a super 8 so the image is grainy and dark , making things very difficult to see it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet . also grating is the soundtrack , made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal seriously , what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal ? while one isn not expecting oscar worthy performances , the acting is still strictly amateur hour , as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened . in the end , i m sure fans of no budget gorefests will love this . everyone else though , will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs .

1			gray	usual no	ms	big	family	entire	performances	bad no			nat voiced by trevor gagnon , along with his brainiac friend iq voiced by philip bolden and the always hungry scooter david gore are kids with big drea ms they want to be the first flies in space . and what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon , the apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out . the first thing you notice is the animation of the film . i found it done very well done . the scenery had depth to it , as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes . i didn not see the movie in 3 d , as it was broadcast on hbo . however , i could see that there really wasn not any scenes which took advantage of the 3 d effects except a fight between characters near the end . i also wasn not really impressed with the design of the characters . to me , they didn not look like anything resembling a fly , especially in the coloring . the flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me . the performances from the cast was not bad , but it wasn not good either . there were many times i focused more on my computer than the story . the writing was certainly written for a younger audience , with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh . i saw nothing for adults , like jokes that they will get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning . history was not followed in this film . in fact , i think it was completely ignored , as the main focus was the flies . i also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction , and no flies were on apollo 11 i did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though . if you are an adult , this is not for you . it was not made for the entire family . this is certainly just for kids . but , save this one for a rainy day .
1			scheme	worthy	illness	severe	resolution	lacking	anyone	familiar	power	erotic	life	real	soldier	aggressive	israelis	nice	characters	shallow	power	understandable	seems	appropriate no	device	dramatic	films	bad			the bubble is an effort to make a gay romeo & juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian , although it seems to come at it by way of friends or beverly hills 90210 the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line . the movie seems torn between fluff and depth . on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as in one example of many some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand , and get answers like , hey , we are here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation . don not get political ! beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line , it's just one of many ham fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests . on the other hand , the movie's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of bent a play about gays in a nazi labor camp . the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed , undermining its erotic power understandable given the constraints of film time , but still this could have been edited to much better effect . and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film . too bad . this play deserves much better . the characters are so one dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire though the word seems inappropriate here substance . the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named golan . the militant palestinian is named jihad . the striving for chic faghag roommate is lulu . anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine , whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well , the rest of this fluffy fantasy . when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful , an ambulance shows up in minutes . the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac . altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance , not the series of bone numbing , soul crushing , humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth , death , or severe illness . ashraf , the palestinian lover , seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems , no papers , no hassles . he just shows up whenever he likes . when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardo . against the backdrop of nice , supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers . gay israeli palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleem's salaam / shalom so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think . gloriously bad films like the works of ed wood at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them . this one doesn not even have that going for it . most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes , and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes , the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tv movie of the week .

1			westerns	old	colour	good	colour	rich	tv	british	uniforms	modern	sets	good			oh dear ! what a disappointment . i have been watching old westerns on british tv for decades , and i wasn not aware of this one until its showing yesterday most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again . the rich colour and outdoor sets were good , but that's all i can say about this film . i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made . several times i felt like turning it off , and finally i did , halfway through , something i hardly ever do . scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls , his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad . and i have a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern , not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns . perhaps it got better in the second half , but i couldn not be bothered to wait and see .

1			facts	historical	addition	appalling	strategist	great	tribes	local	series	original	actors	good	mini	original			as a south african , it's an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense ! despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original shaka zulu mini , this addition to the series is appalling ! the original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist , leader and warrior . a man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in south africa . the plot of this film , however , is nothing but hogwash , scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid nineties . while omar sharif and henry cele are good actors , what is david hasselhoff doing here , rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile ? i kept expecting blond , busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits , for no apparent reason . not that this would have been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party , where someone's caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an african theme for his next blockbuster .
1			man	young	doughty	worth	hunk	young	flick	romantic	flesh	physical			the crush is a pleasant enough 40 something friends romantic chick flick for the first two thirds or so , as it tries to be a brit sex and the city . i particularly enjoyed the turn around of the trophy young hunk whose character is not much fleshed out come to think of it we didn not see all that much physical flesh of him either and kenny doughty is worth seeing more of . they sure make a lot more deal of young man / older woman than was made of the opposite in either version of sabrina neither movie do i like or for that matter with the douglas / zeta jones or dion / svengali nuptials . surrounding andie macdowell as an ex pat otherwise are welcome familiars from brit dramas and comedies , such as tart tongued anna chancellor . the plot twists towards the end feel very deus ex machina . but it wasn not until the credits came up at the end that i realized what might really be wrong . just as with sex and the city , the writer / director is male , here first timer scot john mckay , and i think he really wanted to do a script about three gay men , probably about them coming out in relation to their lovers and at work the characters are a school principal , a cop and a doctor , which would have been a better and more interesting movie . the working title for the film was the sad f cker's club which would have made its parallels with the gay broken hearts club even more obvious . originally written 4 6 2002

1			entry	new	feel	compelled	montage	musical	value	low	guy	foreign			every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people . if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie , how great will be my joy . where to begin my discussion of pain . for starters , there was a musical montage every five minutes . there was no character development . every character was a stereotype . we had swearing guy , fat guy who eats donuts , goofy foreign guy , etc the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot . the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation . have the directors , producers , etc ever even seen a movie before ? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry . the concept for this movie sounded so funny . how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors . but trust me when i say this , things went wrong , very wrong .
1			way	best	tale	little	secret	terrible	music	constant	couple	married	person	average	music	worst	circumstances	mysterious	house	haunted			that is the best way i can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances . that sounds well and good , but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom . in fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin . well trust me , no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls , peacocks , weird gardeners , and doors being knocked on . and the music is the worst , it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader . and you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking . someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate . yes in the end this is a slow paced which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour , boring little tale , that is easily figured out by the average person . apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person .

1			tim	ordinary	idea	cute			director fred schepisi roxanne directs this well intentioned , but inferior comedy about albert einstein matthau trying to hook his scientific niece ryan up with ordinary guy tim robbins in order to get her to relax and enjoy life in the 1950 s . to get ryan to like robbins , einstein tries to make robbins look like a brilliant scienti st the idea is cute , but the film falls flat with corny situations and silly dialogue . tim robbins , meg ryan , and the terrific supporting cast do their best to keep this silly comedy afloat , but are unable to rescue the film . its unfortunate that so much talent went into producing such a lackluster movie . i would not recommend to anybody unless they are huge fans of meg ryan .
1			movie	good	things	bad	it	good no	it	interesting	it	bad no	chuck	decent	it	amusing	movie	great			if you haven not seen the gong show tv series then you won not like this movie much at all , not that knowing the series makes this a great movie . i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious proble ms 1 it's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in , the late 1970 s and early 1980 s . 2 you get a lot of funny cameos of people you have seen on the show . 3 it's interesting to see chuck the host when he isn not doing his on air tv personality . 4 you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show . i won not list all the bad things because there's a lot of them , but here's a few of the most prominent . 1 the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length . 2 the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point . 3 chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor , but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970 s flatness . it's a good movie to watch when you don not have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once . watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad . but even then it's not so good either .
1			myself	confused	writers	plain	endings	happy	way	real	session	little			it seems there's a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema . namely , happy endings aren not very common . beautiful thing excluded , gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death . and some , like come undone , just end . period . the creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot , direction , and timelines . within the first ten minutes of this film , i found myself a bit confused , and even more so after the first glimpse of jeremie elkaim's character having a little psych session . it seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency . there's no real way to tell when you are viewing the present or some sort of ethereal flashback . i could only take so much before it became truly unappealing . stephen holden of the new york times called this film . shimmeringly beautiful and utterly real . well , it seems that stephen invested in beer goggles prior to viewing , as this is truly far from beautiful . due to all the praise this film received , i expected something worth watching . sadly , the film lived down to its title . and by the end of the movie which provided no resolution whatsoever , i might add it's plain to see that the writers , the director and the film have all come undone .

1			acting	bad	closure	good			well since seeing part's 1 through 3 i can honestly say that they should have never made part 4 everything from the tacky , and i do mean tacky score to the really bad acting , i dare anyone to watch this and not be bored out of their minds . i mean parts 1 to 3 kept the vibe strong on the plot of damion , but without him around in this one it's just not the same . sure by the end of part 3 i was getting a little tired of the continued story line's , but it was a good closure at the end of the third one . again there was no reason for a part 4 even if there was they could have done a much better job than this sh t i had to sit through , lol . there goes an hour and a half of my life i will never see again .

1			pacing	horrendous	age	golden	it	hard	woman	eccentric	film	unique	film	dull	killings	gruesome	women	young	sleepaway	classic	film	little	woman	old	mother	old	it	worth	it	unbelievable			unhinged is one strange little film , a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre . it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique . it's plot is fairly overdone three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter . very quickly , the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic . on top of that , the mother and daughter seem to have a very , very strange relationship , as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner . the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them . halfway through the film , when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help , the killing begins . as far as the acting goes , this film is at the bottom of the barrel . none of the three stranded girls can act , particularly the lead girl . it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same , wooden tone throughout the film . the mother and daughter are better , but not much . the film is also quite dull in parts and really , really drags . the killings are gruesome , but nothing we haven not seen before . however , as mentioned on here , the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending . it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic sleepaway camp . unfortunately , the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring , boring pacing . the isolated , creepy looking mansion and the dark , foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism , but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act . it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end , but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes . 4 out 10

1			characters	ridiculous	plot	ridiculous	tendencies	social	problem	biggest	you	desperate	guy	new	inconsistencies	entertaining	d	poor			the plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify as plot and character . the biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark , out of focus , and blurry . the fact that fulci filled the whole movie with mist doesn not help . on the other hand , the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence . the inconsistencies are pretty entertaining , one of the main characters says he has no friends , yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time , and has a whole gaggle of women on the side . though he does show his anti social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b d who's just minding his own business ! images of blood or gore flowing get more attention than the characters but what do you want from fulci . maybe it ruined his career , but it wasn not really much more stupid than zombie . worth a rental if you like gory italian flicks or are desperate for sword and sorcery or something bizarre . how do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help ?
1			house	haunted	it	stupid	response	psychological	it	bad	she	crazy	nell	convinced	it	pointless	story	great	purpose	true	changes	inexplicable	town	nearest			the haunting , if you have seen the original , you know a great ghost story , it's perfection on film . it's a haunting tale of 4 people who go into a haunted house and with the simple trick of sound and movements , it terrified people . it still remains effective to this day if you appreciate film . so when the haunting was remade in 1999 a lot of people pretty much had the same reaction what ? why ? what the but in my opinion if a remake is respectful enough and just wants to reinvent the story for the newer generation , i m pretty cool with it . this is definitely not the case , this is just a disrespectful boring shame that will waste your time and i guarantee will deliver no scares pfft ! pg -13 what where they thinking ? not much apparently . when her mother dies and her sister evicts her , nell receives a phone call , telling her about an ad for an insomnia study run by doctor david marrow at hill house , a secluded manor . upon arrival , nell meets mr and mrs dudley , a strange pair of caretakers who do not stay on the property after dark . shortly thereafter , two other participants in the study arrive , wild theo and bad sleeper luke sanderson along with doctor marrow . unknown to the participants , doctor marrow's true purpose is to study the psychological response to fear . each night , the caretakers chain the gate outside hill house , preventing anyone from getting in or out until morning , when the caretakers open the lock . there are no working telephones inside hill house and the nearest town is several miles away . doctor marrow revels the story of hill house . the house was built by hugh crain , crain built the house for his wife , hoping to fill it with a large family full of children , however all of crain's children died during birth . crain's wife killed herself before the house was finished , and crain became a recluse . the first night , theo and nell begin to experience strange phenomenon within the house , including odd noises and inexplicable temperature changes . nell is confronted after the main hallway is vandalized with the words welcome home , eleanor , and becomes extremely distraught , setting out to prove that the house is haunted by the souls of those victimized by crain's cruelty . she learns that crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them when they were of no more use to him . he then burned the bodies in the house's fireplace to hide any evidence . she also learns that crain had a second wife named carolyn , of whom nell is descended . everyone thinks she's crazy while nell is convinced this is where she belongs . seriously , i suggest you stay away from this film , it's really stupid and pointless . not to mention the actress the played nell , lili taylor completely annoyed me , her performance , her look , just everything about her , don not get me started on things i would do just to not see her in film again . catherine zeta jones just didn not fit in her role as well and liam neeson , a wonderful actor wasted talent once again . the effects are way over the top and too computerized , i just can not believe that they would trash a wonderful classic with this crud . believe me , if you are going to be afraid of something , be afraid of seeing how you can turn a great ghost story into an annoying piece of overblown stupid . oh , this film is already hurting me , just don not see it , it's bad . 1 10

1			babe	old	it	hard	film	poor	ones	good	oliver	young	stuff	good			when the folks at kino video assembled their fine slapstick encyclopedia collection , a multi cassette selection of silent comedies , someone decided to kick off the first installment with one too many 1916 , an obscure one reel farce made in florida starring the very young oliver hardy . as enjoyable as the set is over all , this decision was an unfortunate one , for one too many is a very poor film which almost discourages the viewer from watching further . like any typical farce , this one involves deception inspired by greed , panic when plans go awry , and complications escalating to the point of absurdity , but unlike the good ones , one too many is incoherent , unfunny , and downright annoying . it's hard to tell at this point whether the hopelessly confusing plot is the result of missing footage or inept film making , but whatever the cause , by the halfway point even the most alert viewer has no idea what the character relationships are or what is happening , and by the end one no longer cares . the only point of interest here is seeing the 24 year old babe hardy , who appears considerably heavier than he would a decade later when he teamed with stan laurel , but who is nonetheless full of youthful energy . in the opening scene , awakening with a hangover , babe performs a highly athletic backward roll off a bed . trust me , that's as funny as this movie gets . if you read this before seeing the first cassette of kino's slapstick encyclopedia i suggest you fast forward past this one and skip to the good stuff .
1			eggs	hard	milestones	classic	guillotine	little	names	familiar	gimmicks	adorable	twist	original	gimmicks	little			transylvania 6 -5000 is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80 s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script . two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent , very much against their will , to transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist frankenstein . there are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film , like a little guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table . the wholesome of the film , however , is not as successful as it could and should have been , with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong . the roger corman production transylvania twist , which came out four years after this , is a lot funnier and much more recommended . the film is particularly parodying the classic universal milestones of the early 30 s , so you better make sure you have seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references . there's a pretty original twist indicating that the frankenstein character only behaves like a mad raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory . it's also revealed that he's actually more of a father damien sort of messiah who's only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters . michael richards , the freaky guy who plays kramer in seinfeld , stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments . i m pretty sure john turturro's character in mr deeds was inspired by richards's role here .

1			york	new	i	crazy			i have never been to paris , but after seeing paris , je t aime i m crazy to visit this city ! i have been to ny several times and i love the city and its boroughs . i kinda expected to be touched by this film , to feel like jumping into a plane and fly there right away , but , lo and behold , i regret the time and money i spent with it . there are no love stories between people or a person and the city . there's a lot of dysfunctional meetings and relations or people who know each other and it just doesn not work out fine . maybe this reflects a characteristic of the city , where it's said to have thousands of people living on their own . can not you find love in new york ?
1			etiquette	social	thing	dull	days	old	theatrics	melodramatic			before the release of george romero's genre defining night of the living dead , zombies were relatively well behaved creatures . they certainly had much better table manners in the old days . but social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the movie going public ? judging by this film , none whatsoever . the story is about an expedition to cambodia , whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication . one of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie army . this film is basically a love triangle with zombies . but seeing as this is a 30 s movie , the said zombies are more like somnambulists than the flesh eating variety we think of today . they seem to respond to mind control , rather than insatiable appetites . and , quite frankly , the are volt is somewhat underwhelming too . the whole thing is really very dull . aside from the lack of horror , there isn not any over the top melodramatic theatrics to keep us entertained . it seems unlikely that this could have provided much entertainment even 70 years ago . see it if you have to see everything with zombie in the title but otherwise i would advise skipping this one .

1			sequences	interesting	it	hate	actor	capable	something	big	phenomenon	electronic	wife	dead	everyone	forgettable	climax	choppy	press	bad	film	good			john rivers life as an architect and family man has taken a turn for the worst when his wife has disappeared and has been concluded dead after a freakish accident that involved changing a tyre on her car . during the days she has been missing , he confronts a man that's been following and he tells him that his been in contact with his dead wife from the other side through e . v . p electronic voice phenomenon . naturally he doesn not believe it but then hear gets weird phone calls from her phone and so he contacts the man to find out more about e . v . p . soon enough john is hooked onto it , but something supernatural doesn not like him interfering with the dead , as now other then contacting his wife , the white noise is foretelling events before they happen . since this dvd has been sitting on my shelf for a while now , i thought i better get around to watching it since it wasn not my copy . but then again i don not think the owners were in a hurry to get it back , as they haven not question me about it . oh well . so i decided to give it a play , as i was in an undemanding mood . after hearing and reading all the bad press on it , i wasn not expecting anything remotely good , but i was kept entertained for 90 minutes . well , more so the 60 minutes , as the last half an hour was pretty much a blur of confusion . the film is nowhere as good as it could have been , but the time breezed by quick enough even though it's a rather tepid supernatural thriller . i thought it wasn not all a waste . the first hour i found some effective sequences rather interesting and there's a spooky awe generated with a slow progression of subtle stillness and tragedy that haunts you , but sadly that comes to a crashing halt later on in the film . that's when the predictably forced jump scares come into their own and somehow it just doesn not fit in with the context . it becomes rather hectic , loud and very muddled with its mtv style editing and kinetic camera work that gets to close into the action . i couldn not understand what was going on within choppy and abrupt climax . the whole explanation how everything fits into the bigger picture is pure hokey . it's a very unsatisfying conclusion because it goes for something big , but hits rock bottom . i thought they did fine job up until that point with the lighting and showy camera work . other then the distinctively stark lighting , the score kept this flick atmospherically gloomy . all of it is very slickly done with its glossed up and fancy hardware , which makes it come across as very sterile and empty . you can easily see that the film's heart is in the technical components and not in expanding the characters and story . there's just no connection and lasting sentiment within this flimsy material . after a while , it just tries too hard to convince you that it falls into manipulative thrills and popping in many blood curdling stuff from beyond the grave . it just got rather repetitious watching someone watch a fuzzy tv screen after while . the e . v . p machine was the star on the show . well , it did have more impact than the limp performances . michael keaton is more than capable actor , but lately his disappeared off the map and here he provides a modest performance as the dangerously obsessed john rivers . he really deserves much better , though . everyone else is pretty brittle and forgettable . not because of the performances , but of the lack of depth in their characters . this clunker wasn not bad to begin with , but it does go pear shape by falling away drastically . i wouldn not care to see it again and i wouldn not recommend to anyone , unless you got a interest for the subject matter and enjoy the recent crop of hollywood produced horror / thrillers . it's just a damn shame that this over produced flick couldn not put it together successfully , as it had promise in its idea and a more than decent cast on hand . i didn not hate it , but what a disappointment .
1			dinos	stiff	marines	pathetic	friends	old			arg . the shuffling dinosaurs are back to take another bite out of our sanity in this all awful third film . this time , european terrorists irish i would say hi jack an army convoy supposed to be transporting uranium . they pull into a shipyard , open the truck and discover our old friends the carnosaurs . pandemonium comes visiting then when the rubber dinos chomp the terrorists , the cops and some marines . the whole film seems to be again largely inspired from alien as carnosaur 2 was with the pathetic marines going through the claustrophobic shipyard ? guns at the ready . this third opus is probably the driest and ungoriest film of the lot , with only one spurt of blood when a rubber dino rips a marine's head off . the dinos are stiff , shuffling creatures as usual and the t rex sounds like an enraged elephant when it roars it also appears to have no eyes . one of the goofiest scenes of the film is when the coppers arrive on the scene they enter the building where the hijacked truck is kept and hear some weird noise coming from another truck . on opening it , surprise ! the rubber reptile gang burst out and devour them . why were the dinos locked up in the second truck after escaping from the first ? how did they get locked in as the truck door could only be locked from the outside ? what was the point of filming this scene ? ? oh bother , who cares ? both thumbs down for the over sized rubber iguanas .
1			film	great	subject	suspenseful	prisoners	british			this film is about british prisoners of war from the world war ii escaping from a camp in germany . i find the wooden horse disappointingly boring . the subject could have been thrilling , suspenseful and adrenaline fuelled , but the wooden horse is told in a very plain way . it's a collection of plain and poorly told events , with no suspension and thrill . the first half plainly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel , but the events are so plain , with not enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge . the latter half of the film is even worse , they are just moving from one place to another without any cat and mouse chase . and could the characters talk a bit less and have more action in an action film ! i am disappointed by the wooden horse , it wasted the potential to be a great film .
1			points	good	michum	fun	bowden	decent	lines	great	he	dead	parts	good			this remake of the 1962 orginal film o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch . deniro is a superb actor , dedicated to giving his all in the work he does , however he needs direction to focus his talent , and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film . gregory peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch , even with as few lines as this . nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as weeds . joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation . some good points ? the start credits ! the first view of cody's back when doing dips in the prison , the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats , sam bowden's decent into full fledged panic , cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence . the worst ? the cleaning woman but not really ! ! part . clinging bare handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed . are there no speed bumps in the us ? the he's dead but not really ! ! parts and the aforementioned rambling ending . i may watch the original again , but i have yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it .
1			part	dramatic	schoolgirl	old	bit	little	name	bad	writings	great	context	historical			dietrich bonhoeffer's writings have had a profound influence on my life as a christian , and i eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life . words can hardly express my disappointment . this movie was gave no background about his life , no historical context , and nothing about his great writings except a brief , passing reference to the cost of discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie . instead , we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the states and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to germany . apparently to show his human side . ok , i m ready for the dramatic part . the part where he stands up for his faith . instead of emphasizing that , we get a very badly acted romance with a 17 year old schoolgirl . whether or not that actually took place , it should not have been a major portion of the movie . now . still waiting for the dramatic part , or some narration explaining what his writings were all something to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man . drum roll . . waiting . . nada . this is the kind of movie that gives christian films a bad name . all they had to do was set up a structure for the movie to follow , with some some voice overs , or flashbacks to him preaching from his narrative about who he was and where he had been . but is what we got . hardly fitting for a hero of the faith .
1			show	crappy			i picked this up at the video store because of tarantino's recommendation if you don not like this , go f& yourself ! on the box . seemed like a ringing endorsement . i was expecting something a bit more like death proof . not much actual violence in this one tho , or plot , of character , or dialogue . look at the poster . it's all there . stunts , and rock . it goes back and forth . a week or so in the life of an la band that does a crappy magic show , at a level that you would maybe see in one of the lesser casinos off the strip , and an aussie stuntman new in town finding his feet . they work , they meet girls , they party . end of story . the band obviously needed all that stuff because they are frankly second tier , and playing a style that was already dated in 1978 it has to be said that the stunt bits in the film are genuinely spinetingling that aussie fellow really is something , and the film seems largely motivated by love and respect for the art . i hung it there to see what crazy thing he would do next . just wish he could have found a better vehicle .

1			movie	original	start	weak	characterization	poor			while i count myself as a fan of the babylon 5 television series , the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start . although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there , the pace of the gathering is slow , the makeup somewhat inadequate , and the plot confusing . worse , the characterization in the premiere episode is poor . although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems , i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series .
1			evidence	little	minutes	hilarious	adventure	worst	value	minimal	adventure	compelling			curiously , season 6 of the columbo series contained only three episodes and there is very little evidence of quality in at least two of the scripts , based on this outing for the man in the mac and also fade into murder . furthermore , it is not a coincidence that peter feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here . this adventure is very rarely compelling and many of the performers just look disinterested with the material . the story is rather weakly developed with some protracted periods of boring conversation . columbo is also shadowed by a colleague here similar to last salute to the commodore but the entertainment value is minimal . to add to this , celeste's holm characterisation , which is intended to provide comedy , induces embarrassment rather than laughs . the script wavers off to deal with the family history and the murderess does enough to gift columbo the case , though there is never a credible discussion relating to the motives of her crime . ironically , what turns out to be , arguably , columbo's worst adventure produces the funniest moment in the series . he quizzes a male hairdresser and has a haircut / manicure at the same time . the next 5 minutes are hilarious it's just that columbo's hair is so perfectly groomed , then he can not afford to pay the bill and then , when he makes enquiries at a jewellers he keeps glancing in the mirror to admire his hairstyle ! sadly , this is the only decent moment from a script that looks like it has been cobbled together in ten minutes . for columbo completionists only .
1			felt	sorry	sense	little	shows	little	people	real	life	real	roles	various	melodies	traditional	beauty	traditional	girl	young	instrumentation	traditional	directors	great	flare	great	girl	anxious	chairman	mysterious			memoirs of a geisha is a visually stunning melodrama that seems more like a camp , drag queen satire than anything to do with real people . the first half of the film defensively keeps insisting that geishas are neither prostitutes nor concubines , that they are the embodiment of traditional japanese beauty . but other than one breathtaking dance , the rest of the movie degenerates into pretty baby in storyville territory , or at least vashti and esther in the purim story , as all the women's efforts at art and artifice are about entertaining much , much older , drunken boorish men . maybe it is japanese culture that is being prostituted , and not just to the american louts after world war ii . perhaps it's the strain of speaking in english , but ziyi zhang shows barely little of the great flare she demonstrated in house of flying daggers shi mian mai fu and hero ying xiong . michelle yeoh occasionally gets to project a glimmer of her assured performance in crouching tiger , hidden dragon wo hu cang long . only li gong shows any real life . otherwise , i kept picturing charles ludlam in various roles , or even cillian murphy , as in kabuki theater , particularly as the plot dragged down in cat fight after cat fight . the supposed love story has zero chemistry , mostly due to the age differences , and i mostly felt sorry for ken watanabe and hoped his hollywood pay check compensated for his loss of dignity as the mysterious chairman . i remember more emotion in portrait of jennie as the young girl is anxious to grow up into jennifer jones to please joseph cotton . we see brief glimpses of reality when the geishas pose with regular women as photographic attractions , and as an ageless ziyi zhang lives out the war years in a very colorful kimono dying operation . the finale has little sense of normality . the score includes many chopped up traditional melodies , with cello by yo yo ma and violin by yitzhack pearlman instead of traditional instrumentation , that are beautiful to listen to in accompaniment to the lovely cinematography , as long as one completely ignores the plot and stiff acting . as my mind wandered , i wondered how the great japanese directors of samurai movies would have dealt with this story , which probably would have been more formal , but a lot more emotional .

1			nightmare	worst	scene	adorable	mystery	biggest	features	special	grade	low	adventures	similar	effects	special	look	human	someone	awesome	lifters	gross	store	local	ross	criminal	film	alright	point	low	it	human			intergalactic criminal kol ross hagen has been sentenced to death and awaits execution on a spaceship designed for just such a purpose . but tonight there's going to be a jailbreak , and kol flees on a conveniently placed escape pod and flies towards earth which apparently is nearby . there he confronts a group of teenagers who look thirty and a game warden john phillip law , who help protect him from his worst nightmare . the bounty hunter and executioner android or more properly gynoid the alienator . from the cover of the box , i was confident this was going to be an awful movie . but , as awful as it turned out to be , it was a ton of fun as well probably at least partially because i was watching it with someone who happens to be intensely awesome . the director fred olen ray , who has specialized in making over one hundred low grade films most notably hollywood chainsaw hookers , does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects . bonus p . j . soles appears as tara , obviously at a low point in her career . sure , there's plot holes . why are there hillbilly rednecks in california allegedly los angeles county if i understood the warden correctly . what's up with the space woman's tacky blouse ? why is there a subplot about the ship captain forcefully trying to win her heart when this story goes nowhere ? what the heck is quadrant 5 ? how does chicken wire create an electromagnetic field that will short circuit an android , yet land mines do virtually nothing ? why does kol look like a drunk , native american football player with emphysema ? and the lund guy robert clarke . does his character even have a point ? does the game he plays with the captain have a point ? does this movie have a point ? but the biggest mystery is the android or gynoid the alienator , played by teagan clive . what is an alienator ? why does it look like daryl hannah from blade runner , only much larger ? because , see , if something is a cyborg , it's part human . but if it's an android , it's all machine . this was an android , so there was no reason to make it look human . it could have looked like anything . yet , the person who designed her made her the size of a linebacker , with david bowie's hair and a leotard that shows me just a little too much . if you are going to make a female android , wouldn not the purpose be to have her be seductive and lure enemies in ? mission not accomplished . they say beauty comes in all shapes and sizes , but i think i found a huge exception . if mystery science theater 3000 were still around today , this film would be on a very short list of movies that need to get harangued . beyond the butt nasty alienator sorry , teagan , female weight lifters are gross the film is alright . maybe there's not much of a story and maybe the characters aren not really very interesting . and maybe the scene with the deer is incredibly adorable for no particular reason what use does a killer robot have with a deer ? but overall , i actually liked the movie . i won not be pimping it out to my friends or running out to my local video store to pick up the latest dvd copy which i m sure is just packed with amazing special features not . but i consider seeing this movie time well spent and look forward to similar adventures in the future .
1			it	good	effects	special	movie	average	effects	bad			this was a better than average movie i thought , for it being on cable . i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughter / target / shot , etc the cast was well chosen . i especially liked ron livingston as the hard pressed swat commander . it's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers . the producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997 so , if you get a chance to see this film , and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything 50 2 hours and enjoy it .

1			stars	fundamental	match	best	interfernce	necessary	superstars	former	execution	poor	talents	true	boot	big	match	worst	match	good	move	special			this was allocated to the fans as the winner takes all match occurred between two separate companies the world wrestling federation and the alliance an amalgamation of former wcw and ecw superstars . because the final match to duduce the superior company was a tag team match , the wrestlers were confined to tossing opponents from each side of the ring to another ; each wrestler concludes that in order to debiliate their opponents and to intensify the match , interfernce is necessary . each wrestler merely pummels an opponent with punches , executes a special move , and tags in a partner . the storyline had previously been tarnished by the subterfuge of vince that a member of the allance would be fradulent and join the wwf . it was obvious , with that statement , that the wwf would prevail . overall very innovative storyline but poor execution , which is not the scarcity of the wrestlers because the match format is tag team . the remaining matches are just revolting edge versus test potent big boot by test , but this did not display the true talents of both stars al snow versus christian good match but superflous to the pay per view taji versus william regal the worst match of the night immunity battle royal this was an outstandingly fun match to watch , but because the main stars of both companies were involved in the main event , only a wrestler who characteristically appears on heat and is probably a wcw light heavyweight reject that is , the hurricane who is merely hired as an entertainer hardy boyz versus dudley boyz the best match of the night jeff hardy executed a swanton bomb from the summit of a cage and through a wooden table and matt was wedged into the cage , which appeared to be extremely painful . because stone cold was the wwf champion , rob van dam was the hardcore champion , and kurt angle was a mole in the alliance , all fundamental stars in the main event on the faction of the alliance were granted work after the match's outcome , except for booker t . who recently attacked a wrestler on raw and will inevitably be given work . shane mcmahon will return to television somehow , and everyone desired to witness the downfall and demise of the alliance to see stone cold out of work . the wwf has done much better . a match in which all tiltes were brought to one faction would have been better , and what ever became of casket and iron man matches ?
1			nonsense	ridiculous			i was extremely suspicious of the ideas presented in this movie , but being relatively ignorant of quantum physics aside from what i recalled from the excellent short history of nearly everything and what i was able to choke down in a brief history of time , it sounded interesting at times . however , the obvious nonsense of the story of the indians being unable to see the ships of the explorers was ridiculous . i really started questioning what was being shoveler at that point , but then the clincher was the revelation that one of the speakers was actually channelling some loony named ramtha completely upset the applecart for me . what a waste of two hours .

1			acting	melodramatic	intentions	great	it	painful	dialogue	horrible	movie	crap	waste	total	sets	great	props	authentic			this movie has the made for tv stink all over it . though , it started out with great intentions , featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes . the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue , and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting . the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo , and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another . the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch . the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are . please take my word for this . i am a huge fan of the war genre , and this movie is crap . nevertheless , this dvd does have an excellent extra feature , covering letters from the wwi front lines , thus making this rental not a total waste of my time .
1			partner	old	shows	classic	episode	single	carlo	essential	bit	inexplicable	shows	special	monsters	famous no	touch	nice	cast	original	museum	local	cast	new	series	original no	rewriting	little			following the success of the awful gilligan's island tv movie reruns , a number of tv movies were made in the 1980 s reuniting casts from classic shows . most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special . the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy type comedy style that really wasn not in the original series . yvonne de carlo , a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series , is completely wasted she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode . and since the roles of eddie and marilyn in this movie are nothing more than cameos , what was the point of making them younger and recasting them ? with very little rewriting , they could have used butch patrick and pat prie st although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch , i didn not enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters ironically that very year , 1981 caesar's old partner in comedy , imogene coca , was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies . another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum . why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a typical if strange american family , not famous monsters ? this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles , there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980 s with a completely new cast and a 1990 s tv movie which featured decarlo , lewis , priest , and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining .

1			robbins	capable	performance	extraordinary	matthau	perfect	story	good	chemistry	romantic	music	awful	relief	good	it	fun	mood	good			when i first saw this film , i thought it should have come from the children's section it's very fun and at times humorous , and is actually quite a good story , but it severely lacks the romantic chemistry that actors like meg ryan and tim robbins are capable of delivering . i must note that walter matthau is perfect for the part of albert einstein , and his performance is extraordinary , but that's the sole exception . this film appears a bit forced , the directing lacks substance , and oh music is ridiculously awful , it didn not put me in a very good mood . but if you are not expecting a smart , well crafted comedy / romance tale , then this certainly can be entertaining , like i should be in the children's section . einstein and his buddies are a good relief from tim robbins boring , almost tense quest to steal meg ryan's heart . a very conflicting film , but as long as it's not taken seriously this can be an alright movie .

1			waste	complete	parody	funny	bits	funny no	gags	lamest	runtime	entire			let me start by saying that i understand that invasion of the star creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the 50 . i understand that none of it is to be taken seriously . the problem i have is that none of it works . a parody should be funny and this one just isn not . not once during the entire runtime did i so much as crack a smile . in general , i am easily entertained , but i couldn not find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in invasion of the star creatures . i knew i was in trouble right from the beginning . the two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can not control that gets them both wet . these two come off as bowery boys wannabes . why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the bowery boys is beyond me . after the less than illustrious beginning , the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences , dancing indians , vegetable men , decoder rings , and other assorted unfunny bits . it's all just a complete waste of time . i bought this on the double feature dvd with invasion of the bee girls . that movie is academy award winning stuff in comparison with invasion of the star creatures .
1			attention	little	subject	powerful	acting	poor	disappointment	biggest			i think the biggest disappointment in this film was that , right until the end , i expected the acting instructors of the cast to break in and apologize for how poor the acting was . when you consider the powerful subject , the brilliant scenery and the effort made in creating a wonderful set and spectacular images , it is a shame that little attention was given to acting .
1			audience	hate	waste	hilarious	revolution	french	glimmer	little	film	entire			if i only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor , enough film for only one take of each shot , and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes , and was forced to make an over -2 hour movie about the french revolution , and also didn not have any sets and had to have my 4 year old autistic son paint the backgrounds , and also the only actors i could find were the people who didn not make the auditions of that year's soap opera , and i was also forced to not use any music in the entire film , and also the zoom function on the camera didn not work except for one time when it accidentally started zooming in and couldn not stop , oh and if i hated my audience , then i might make something kind of like this awful , yet mistakenly hilarious , hell worthy waste of time . the almost grand looking but completely fake looking backdrops reminded me of some of george lucas latest creations , which made it so much more disappointing because through the whole movie , there was that little glimmer of hope in the back of my mind that the film would climax in a lightsaber duel / space laser battle . i don not mean to spoil the movie for those who haven not seen it , but that's not how it ends . the only thing i can think of that wasted more time than watching this movie was writing this review . peace .
1			acting	brilliant	people	little	composing	artistic			visually cluttered , plot less , incredibly mind numbing rubbish . not even close to greenaway's better work . avoid at all costs ! the overlapping 'split screen effects do nothing more than confuse , the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the artistic composing of images is pretentious in the extreme . there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film ; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic , which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring . plus , how anyone can say that the acting of ewen macgregor is brilliant is beyond me . he showed more ability in the star wars series , and that's saying something . i have not been so unimpressed with a film since i saw would arby o gill and the little people !

1			action	weak	failure	respectable	budget	low	captain	compelling	effort	respectable	flick	laughable	effects	weak	joke	bad no	issues	racial	film	good	cast	recognizable	locations	great			at first glance this gives the impression that it is going to be a laughable blaxploitation flick , and it does contain moments where it veers in that direction . however , the basic story idea is much stronger than might be expected , and is a respectable effort at portraying racial issues in the world war ii era army . the recognizable cast is hit and miss , with glynn turman , richard pryor and the underused billy dee williams faring be st stephen boyd , however , stops just short of twirling his bushy mustache in an overindulgent star turn . the obviously low budget leads to inconsistency in the production values . the locations are great , the effects and action are weak . imagine if saving private ryan had consisted of half the platoon getting killed exactly the same way vin diesel's caparzo had except we do get to see the shot because they effects can not handle it , then hanks , damon and burns drove around in a jeep and shot five germans for the climax . yet , the denouement , with the heroic soldiers receiving no respect for their accomplishment because they are black , and boyd's racist captain being effected by this , is compelling , as are the sequences of of turman's character writing in a journal of his imagined exploits if the soldiers were allowed to fight instead of digging latrines . in short , black brigade / carter's army doesn not quite succeed . but it's a respectable failure , not a bad joke . it could be remade as a very good film , and , as it stands , is an interesting effort .
1			horrible	horrible	thing	worst			this pile of sh ! t is tied in my book as the worst thing ever made . i can not believe that someone actually relased this crap , let alone acually made it . horrible , horrible , horrible . not even worth mentioning the damn story or any details about it . that's how bad it actually is . avoid it like sars !
1			editing	bad	effects	laughable	liners	ridiculous	set	original	anything	new	nightmare	new	music	annoying	everything	bad	slasher	modern			a student filmmaker enlists a b grade actress a delectably diva ish molly ringwald ! to complete the horror film that her mother a dreadfully dull kylie minogue ! tried to make 12 years ago . it's a curious plot choice to say the least , as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors . the film has a curse on it , because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set . but she's back , because she needs the exposure . unfortunately , the curse is still there and people start dying on the set . cut is an aussie attempt at the modern slasher , but unfortunately it doesn not bring anything new or exciting to the table . in fact , it rips half of wes craven's 90 filmography . lots of film world name dropping a la scream except it's aussie name dropping jane how this isn not as funny and lots of is this real or is this a movie a la new nightmare . the editing is bad , the music is annoying , the effects are laughable , almost everything is bad about this . fortunately , the film can have a sense of humor at one point , a well dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at don not worry , we will treat your house as if it were our own , to which he responds , that doesn not mean anything to me , you look like you live in a dump ! ha ! and molly's ridiculous one liners were enough to not regret renting this one . you got any diet coke in here ? as she rides in the film professor's car and does anyone know where i can buy any tofu ? the first thing she mutters on the set and where the hell is my agent ? oh wait , that's what i was thinking for her .

1			virgin	old	something	serious	store	broad	moments	terrible	something	random	team	promotional	felt	embarrassed	conversation	suck	predictor	good	something	real	flick	entire			might contain spoilers . but believe me , this movie spoils itself from start to finish . i walked into this movie with high expectations . it was my own fault . i had put too much stock in steve carell's record to date . 40 year old virgin . little miss sunshine . the office . and i also made the mistake of coming to imdb and seeing a 7.5 user rating before going to the movie . it's always been a very good predictor in the past , but something is definitely off lately . the last time i felt this embarrassed and in this much pain in a movie theater was watching blue steel in 1990 this flick fumbled from start to finish . the script was flunky material . awful writing all around . murderer of love ? love is an ability ? whoever wrote this crap suffered from the same affliction that struck american beauty's writer s . trying waaaaayyyyyy too ha rd the entire flick was peppered with three's company ish moments like the awful and contrived shower scene . or the pointless / confusing aerobics scene . or the awful laundry room scene . right when you think something serious and / or real is about to happen , they toss in one of these terrible moments . and it happens over and over and over again . and what's with carell's character ? the guy meets some lame broad at a book store and is suddenly head over heels in love ? let's face it . their conversation sucked . they both should have said their goodbye's after a few minutes . pay close attention to the initial conversation when you have the misfortune of watching this movie . carell's character is trying to say something which is absolutely random and un funny i think the exact line was this one time when i was a kid . that's it . seriously , but both are laughing so hard that coffee is about to spout out of their noses . the actors themselves looked like they were in pain , wondering why they are being directed to do what they are doing . back to the imdb thing . you guys need to figure out a way to keep a movie's promotional team off this site . i know it's impossible , but it's painfully obvious the first 20 or so ratings / reviews were either posted by 12 year olds , or by flunky's hired by the studio . check out the family stone's rating . if that's a mid 5 then this absolutely has got to be a 2 . and that's pushing it .
1			line	laughable	acting	poor	film	worst			this film has to be the worst i have ever seen . the title of the film deceives the audience into thinking there maybe hope . the story line of the film is laughable at best , with the acting so poor you just have to cringe . the title zombie nation implies a hoard of zombies when in fact there are six in total . this cannot be categorised as a horror film due to the introduction of cheesy 80 s music when the zombies attack . the zombies actually talk and act like human beings in the film with the only difference being the make up which looks like something out a la roux video . if you ever get the chance to buy this film then do so , then burn the copy .
1			audience	live	laughter	unbearable			firstly i would like to point out that i only know of the show due to my younger sister always watching it . i find it the most annoying program on tv . there is nothing funny about any of the jokes and the canned laughter is unbearable . the show would work much better if filmed in front of a live audience . that way the laughter would show just how unfunny the show is . however i give credit to the acting talents of the young ca st it sickens me however to think that they will look back on the show in the future and see how bad their first tv show was . the show links in well with the overall annoying voices and style of the cbbc presenters . why the youth of today need to be shouted at so much is beyond me . that is all .

1			excuse	big	tip	appropriate	world	real	money	good	blacks	stereotypical	glance	bad	it	important	plot	bizarre	it	true	shows	different	thing	worst	screen	big	change	positive			to preface this review , i must say that i was , i suppose , a little curious about this movie . however , i probably would not have seen it had i not had my arm slightly twisted . in my opinion , this movie shows just how depraved man can be . in my eyes , the worst thing about this whole springer phenomenon is not that type of people on the jerry springer show act as they do which in itself is eminently reproachable , but that many people are so curious and excited to watch them and hear about their lives yes , i suppose that includes me . to whatever extent it is true . if not glorifying that kind of behavior as some might say at the very least we may be subtly corrupting our minds and / or desenstizing ourselves to this type of behavior . but enough soapbox sort of . here's the skinny the movie has an r rating , and while it may deserve only that i did look away at some scenes , so i m not completely sure , i feel that an nc -17 tip of the hat to the other reviewer might be a little more appropriate for the immense sexual content a cynic might comment that the movie was just one big excuse to show sex on the big screen . the plot is very bizarre , tying together the stories of an absolutely dysfunctional family and a group of stereotypical blacks upset who will appear on different springer shows . at the end , the movie leaves one with some resolvement and springer rhetoric about the need for us to see the real world evidently as seen through his show . i agree with him there it is important to know how the world really is so that we can seek to effect positive change . having said that , let me just tell you the world's pretty bad glance in a newpaper or the news to see that , but let's not shell out good money to support the kind of sensationalistic and perhaps formulaic titallition that springer seeks to give us .

1			classic	original	thing	good	looks	good	portrayal	criminal	update	horrible	children	young			there is no possible reason i can fathom why this movie was ever made . why must hollywood continue to crank out one horrible update of a classic after another ? cases in point mister magoo , the avengers awful ! christopher lloyd , whom i normally enjoy , was so miserably miscast in this role . his manic portrayal of our beloved uncle martin is so unspeakably unenjoyable to be almost criminal . his ranting , groaning , grimacing and histrionics provide us with no reason to care for his character except as some 1 dimensional cartoon character . the director must have thought that fast movements , screaming dialogue and one take slapstick had some similarity to comedy . apparently he told every actor to act as if they had red ants in their pants . fault must lie with the irresponsibly wrought script . i think the writer used it's a mad , mad , mad , mad world as an example of a fine comedy script . as manic as that 1963 classic is , it is far superior to this claptrap in fact suddenly it looks pretty good in comparison . what is most sad about this movie is that it must have apparently been written to appeal to young children . i just am not sure whose children it was made for . certainly no self respecting , card carrying child i know ! if they had to remake my favorite martian , why didn not they add some of the timeless charm of the original classic ? unfortunately , cannot factor in zero as a rating for its readers , that is the only rating that comes to mind in describing this travesty . one good thing did come from this movie , the actors and crew were paid i think .

1			effect	ridiculous	thing	good			being a fan of the manga and anime of go nagai devil man , devil lady , violence jack , etc , i was looking forward to this one . i would seen neither the manga nor the anime , so i had no preconceived notions going in . good thing , too . what we have here is a series of silly softcore movies of the type that used to turn up with alarming regularity on cable channels late at night . while it's tame compared to what gets rammed down the throats of regular cable viewers our hero's naughty bits are either tastefully tucked away behind a strategically glued on scarf or emblazoned with a ridiculous sunburst effect , there are prolonged scenes of bondage and torture that lend the proceedings just enough smarminess to make it unsuitable for the kiddies . while i have nothing whatsoever against nude female heroes , i do dislike amateurishly made movies there are at least four in this series . on the plus side , there's at least one stunningly beautiful actress in each of the four episodes i saw . it's no wonder nagai's testicle boy never made it .

supposedly this increasingly arrogant natch younger woman has a mania for seizing control . and our brave 40 something must learn to fight back against this evil and erotically hot looking , of course 20 something . but there's this problem . anytime the 20 something starts to maybe get into trouble she uses her power and just flirts or has sex with some guy , and escapes the consequences . well , there actually is something to that capability of good looking 20 somethings . it just isn not generally used in quite this sort of way . the premise is moved along by the device of the 20 something conning the divorcee into formalizing their room rental deal with a written lease produced by her . of course the 40 something doesn not know about these things , and the 20 something has had help . the lease actually gives the younger woman equal right to the whole house during the rental period , with utilities thrown in at the fixed price . even though an eviction proceeding is soon pending , the 20 something soon gets a temporary restraining order against the older woman , supposedly because she has been threatening the 20 something . you know , the judge is sympathetic to all the woe is me of the sexy sweet young thing . finally the 40 something's heroic battle back for the house then begins . woopie ! the only realistic or perceptive thing in this movie is how horrificly easy tro's or orders of protection are for women to get on nothing more than her unsubstantiated say so although they are generally only this easy against men . they are sometimes just as unjustified and just as motivated to seize control of a home as it is here . indeed , girlfriends who have moved in with their boyfriends can often get them evicted from their own homes or condos on the basis of no proof whatsoever , but only an unsubstantiated claim of threats , and sometimes without even hearing his side . even when there is a hearing , it is routinely impossible to rebut claims of threats to prove a negative , when the burden of proof is effectively on the accused , rather than the accuser . this is one of the only areas of american law where that is true and it's a signal outrage of feminist overreaching , and the failure of any organized group to resist the steamroller . of course that's not likely to be the subject of any lifetime movie in this lifetime . the absurd basic premise of this movie relies upon the explanation that the 20 something is psychotic , and isn not taking her medicine . even so it makes no sense . she isn not after the successful lawyer ex husband , though she does con his help to the ex wife's fury in her que st she's after the house technically , to drive the divorcee out of it during the period of the lease . this second younger woman is after all that's left after the divorce , after affairs with other 20 somethings stole her husband ! the ex husband seems unattached and basically solicitous after his fling doesn not matter , he still strayed ! ! the protagonist is good enough looking for her age . but her outlook , attitude and focus is so small minded , frumpy and utterly without imagination or life force that it's impossible to care about her . well , a core group of lifetime fans care , i guess , judging by the average score the small number of raters gave it . i kept watching it only because it was so extremely bad and cartoonish that it had a camp appeal . i couldn not resist seeing just how far they would take it . spoiler if such a thing is possible with this flick . well , here's a clue . the movie ends with the 20 something getting bailed out of jail by promising to listen to her 20 something male co worker and sometimes lover , and do whatever he says and let him take care of her he means get her to keep taking her medicine and then tricking him and returning to the house . there she climbs the stairs with a knife , demonicly stalking her nemesis 40 something , who is taking a bath by candlelight , secure in the thought that the younger woman is out of her life . there's a struggle and the 40 something mom wins by sticking the 20 something with a hypodermic needle full of anti psychotic medicine she had found . she then begins stroking her , mom like , and the two women have a bonding , female solidarity moment ! ! how sweet .
1			film	weak	dramaturgy	wrong	history	troubled	ending	funny	moving	easy no			this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re naming . it doesn not work at all . firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong . it's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end . but there is also and that may have to do with the cuts an uneasy moving between genres . it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire . the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence what little there is . so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all . you can also see that in the very unsteady character almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one .
1			he	bored	characters	weak			yikes did this movie blow . the characters were weak , the plot weaker . i figured this couldn not be too bad because it has christoper walken , oops . he must have done this because he was bored and needed the money . the characters were supposed to be irish but noone had an irish accent . i am desperately trying to find something nice about this , i can not except walken did a fine job with a wooden character . find something to read , or watch discovery , don not ever see this movie .
1			dane	extreme	he	alive	jokes	good			dane tries to hard and is to extreme with all of his yelling and going crazy , spilling water on himself and rolling on the floor . to much . calm down , get yourself together and make us laugh . i didn not quite understand his comparison toward comics and rock stars . just because there both up on stage or something ? he said that every comedian wants to be a rock star . i m sure rodney dangerfield was really into that when he was alive . he had a few good jokes like the burger king joke where people yell at the drive thru . i also liked the reese's pieces joke . if dane just didn not act so mental he might be funnier and i might have given this a higher rating , as high as maybe an eight .
1			it	interesting	lengths	great	baby	haunted	fans	happy	cracks	poor	deaths	least			like freddy's revenge , this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn not go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it . basically alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends . this has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor , so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy . i have not alot to say about this . it's moderately interesting to see the characters of alice and dan returning from four , but not worth watching a movie over . uninspriring and unenjoyable , possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series .

1			harmony	little	character	low	harmony	religious	friends	old			some of my old friends suggested me to watch this movie but i got chance only recently . i had high hopes of seeing something interesting from kamal hans , what i saw was bunch of garbage camera angles mixed at high speed . i could not understand what was the message except demeaning hinduism . i am more like many religion type but i felt kamal hasan is a man low character to have orchestrated this kind of thought . he could have made a horror movie than this crap . he tried to add hollywood genre of viruses and god forbid he did not convert that guy into a mutant and ultimately going to go for world domination . this is a much befitting movie for a film school vs regular public . shame on him for not holding up to the talent he has . starting of story tried chaos to borrow ideas from butterfly effect , then in between little religious harmony at the cost of insulting hinduism once again i insult hinduism more but this movie has no equal and my insult is same for religion in general which may have made this movie intellectual one .
1			flick	conscious	bay	dead	flick	worth	shots	great	flick	pretentious			less self conscious and much less pretentious than guts of a beauty , this kazuo komizu gore flick is worth a look at least once . sleazy snapshotters escort wanna be actresses / models to a remote house in the woods in order to sexually molest them . unfortunately for the horny boys , a long schlonged demon , who lives in the woods , has already targeted the girls for fun . the thing even ends up having fun with the boys that's if you consider beheadings , dismemberment and masturbation with severed limbs fun . once again , it all sounds better on paper than it looks and sounds on film . just as komizu mangled living dead at tokyo bay with his ineptitude , he also mangles this effort and is only saved by some audacious violence and some great white panty shots . don not buy the hype , though , or you will be sorely disappointed .
1			violence	spectacular			trite , clichd dialog and plotting the same kind of stuff we saw all through the 1980 fantasy movies , hokey music , and a paint by numbers characters knocks this out of the running for all but the most hardcore fans . what saves this film from the junk heap is the beautiful crutch of bakshi's work , the rotoscoping , and the fact that frank frazetta taught the animators how to draw like him . this is motion . the violence is spectacular and the art direction and animation are unlike any other sword & sorcery movie of the period . i like to watch this with the sound off , playing the soundtrack to the first conan movie instead .
1			critics	sensible	tools	essential	suckers	poor	you	sick	godsakes	sick	feel	compelled			i am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked , let alone held in such high regard , especially by so many critics who are , otherwise , quite sensible . there is one key word which describes this film to its core irritating . the most easily explained example of this is the director's use or , more accurately , abuse of music . in the first half , a really dull reggae tune is played about three times when once is too often . but in the second half , the mommas and the papas california dreamin is played at least seven times , usually at top volume . godsakes , whether you liked the song or not beforehand , you would be thoroughly sick of it by the end . just think , some people claim to have seen this film four or five times . this means they have listened to california dreamin either 28 or 35 times . . all of this needless hyper repetition it contributes nothing to the story could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit , or if the story was in any way involving . but it ain not . the only aspect i found likeable was bridgette lin's charging around and still playing asia the invincible in a raincoat and sunnies . even this wore off fairly quickly . i m sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it . i can only warn you if you have never seen a hk movie before , don not start with this one . if you feel compelled to watch it , avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema . the fast forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here . you have been warned !
1			william	good			very disappointing film . by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters . i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part , and william macy was good as always , still not worth watching . it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker . insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep .

1			movie	good	experience	previous	experience	enjoyable	i	disappointed			the movie opens upon julian sands , lying on his back , a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it , about two feet above him . that was so provocative , and i thought , here we go ! a good vampire movie ! and then it died . that was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination . it was slow , uneventful drivel thereafter . i was vastly disappointed , as my previous experience with sands acting was quite enjoyable . however , this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired . even julian sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie . it rates a 1.1 10 from . the fiend .

1			star	worth	mr	fantastic	i	offended	wayans	funny	we	stupid			this is the bottom . i am not joking . the theater should have had a warning of some kind . abandon all hope ye who enter here would have been fitting . i don not have the words to describe accurately the hell that this movie is . its debilitating stupidity even fails to amuse . this movie is definitely aimed at some of the slower turtles in the sandbox . the story was blatantly stolen from a 10 minute bugs bunny cartoon and then stretched like mr fantastic to 90 excruciatingly painful minutes . i remember when the wayans's were funny . i guess the pressures of hollywood for them to produce produce produce are to blame for the poop that churns out at a consistent rate . i m sad and offended that they think we are stupid enough to enjoy 90 minutes of kick in the balls jokes with a thin plot based on a cartoon . i disliked nearly everything about this movie . i won not spoil anything but the baby is actually a midget with marlon wayans's face poorly superimposed over the midget's body . what i did like was the ending . not the movie's resolution , but the actual end where we all stood up and walked out . i gave this movie one star , but it clearly deserves less . i don not feel that the six minutes they spent writing the script is worth a star . this does deserve a razzie and i pray to god it gets it . when are people going to learn ; if you stop paying to see this idiocy they will stop pooping it out . seppuku is a reasonable alternative to this film . avoid it at all costs . you have been warned .

1			look	realistic	i	surprised	movie	bad			what a bad movie . i m really surprised that deniro and even snipes would be associated with something like this . if you are going to make a movie that involves baseball , and shows scenes of baseball , at least make the action look somewhat realistic . why was the crowd always standing up for no particular reason during games ? possible spoiler and the last scene in the was that ? we are somehow led to believe that deniro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform , and that the game is even being played in a torrential of the worst ever scenes in a sports movie . 3 stars out of 10

1			position	easy no	treatment	serious	complaint	biggest	girls	young	character	believable	sociopath	average	girls	vulnerable	movie	worst no	it	believable	i	surprised			after seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago , i was curious to see the unedited version . i was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than i remembered , but one thing really stood out . i think other reviewers have mentioned this also , namely , what exactly is the nature and motivation of the chris sarandon character ? has he raped other victims before ? is he completely psychotic or an average sociopath ? how did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister ? is this character at all credible , or is it just a matter of more background being necessary ? he seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character , and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young , vulnerable girls . this seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general . it has nothing to do with his performance , which is terrifyingly movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject , without quite settling into either mode . not the worst movie ever made , but not all that good , either .
1			directing	amateurish	producers	proud	directing	mechanical	i	disappointed	cast	good	directing	stilted			the christmas secret was touted as a wonderful film , but i was truly disappointed . they even sold vhs and dvd copies of the film when it was over , which leads me to think the producers were really proud of this project . as a screen actor myself i felt most of the performances were phoned in , although beau bridges , as nick , did have a moment or two . if i were richard thomas i would not put this film on my otherwise fine resume . it was an embarrassment . i had been a fan since his waltons days , but have found myself untempted to watch any of his subsequent work , so poor was this offering . in defence of the actors , the directing was stilted , mechanical , and thoroughly amateurish . i hope this is not considered a spiteful review and negative assumptions made about my qualifications as a critic . i turned the movie on because it had a good cast and i was prepared to enjoy the film . however i would challenge any one out there to watch this film and not wish for their money back , even though it was on t . v .
1			acting	laughable	i	disappointed	writing	embarrassing	decision	difficult	life	entire	movie	worst			i m going to go on the record as the second person who has , after years of using the imdb to look up movies , been motivated by nacho's film , the abandoned to create an account and post a comment . this was hands down the worst movie i have ever seen in my entire life . the plot was on the verge of non existence , and none of the puzzle pieces added up in any way whatsoever . the acting was laughable and the writing was embarrassing . how this film got backed and came to be is completely beyond me . the only saving grace i could find was anastasia hille's cunning and repetitive use of the f wo rd and brilliant sound design if i were faced with the option of seeing this film again or being mauled by wild bores i would be up against a difficult decision . i m disappointed that i am unable to give it 0 stars .
1			barbarian	cultural	art	hate	fascist	gay			i watched this movie recently together with my sister who likes the performances of sophia loren . i m a person who they call a cultural barbarian . i hate art in any kind of shape or form . rambo is more my kind of movie , action , kills , blood , horror . if you recognize yourself in this avoid this movie like the plague . no one dies , no action , no nudity , nothing of the kind . let me give you a rsum in a few sentences . it starts out with 5 minutes in black and white nazi propaganda . every italian in a housing block attends a parade in honor of hitler , except for a housewife , an anti fascist and a caretaker . the housewife who is cheated by her husband , meets the anti fasci st she falls in love with him , wants to make love to him , but the anti fascist is gay . despite of this they make love with each other . at the end of the day , the housewife reads a book from her gay lover , and the guy himself is deported by agents . the end . you want an even shorter rsum ? boring . that short enough ? the guy should have used his gun in the beginning of this movie and shoot himself , to save the audience from this atrocity . on a side note my sister loved this movie . like i said , i m a cultural barbarian .
1			it	insulting	advertising	false	mission	personal			i have made it my personal mission to go after those responsible for this film . i even got the rental company to give me my money back because i argued that they perpetrated false advertising . it's not enough that the movie itself is a pos . but the cover art is what sold me . i have done better make up effects on my children at halloween than what the movie actually depicts versus the cover art . can you say raccoon eyes ? i m not going to waste more of my time by going into the full details , but come on , the movie's main character is an l . a . cop who was born and raised in alabama but has a german accent ! ! it's beyond insulting .
1			treatment	nice	fan	great no	she	worthy	film	average	character	fabulous	film	good no	i	stunned	production	serious	treatment	big	they	fine			i have grown up reading modesty blaise , both the comics and the books , and she truly is a heroine to me . although not being a great fan of quentin tarantino i anyway was interested to hear a few years back that he was considering making a film of her could he finally give modesty a nice big screen treatment she's worthy of ? i heard of my name is modesty a few months ago and checked the stars it had been given here , and wasn not too surprised to find out the score was not too high , since beloved characters often have hard time melting the fans heart if not done exactly right . so i decided not to read any reviews and see the film instead , and well , i just finished watching it , and i m stunned , and sad , and yeah , pretty furious , too . sad and furious of giving over an hour of my time seeing something so fabulous as modesty blaise character being turned into a film that has nothing to give to a viewer or a fan . it seems that almost everything about this film is sub par and unprofessional , although i must admit seeing some actors in other films earlier where they were fine so i can not blame them . but the screenplay and the directing . my god , why even make this kind of crap with production values slightly bigger than your average tv film but done much worse ? i don not know the background of this film and actually i really don not want to know , but i just can not help wondering that how on earth could tarantino with a straight face tell that he loves modesty and then put his name on this ? he just lost a huge amount of respect in my eyes . the director was not the right man for this job and i can honestly thank him for ruining my night . i give this film 3 stars and those stars go to the actors and the technical quality which could have been worse . the other seven stars missing are what this film was not good at . oh well , hopefully at some point there will be a serious production of the modesty blaise movie that has some other goals than to steal money from the modesty fans . although if people like tarantino are the ones making the decisions i m not holding my breath .
1			puppets	little	films	real	people	real	monsters	big	shame	true	choice	bad no	story	true no	philosophy	nice	band	greatest			odd slasher movie from producer charles band . in the days of full moon's greatest success band said that he would never make real killer films because he felt that little puppets and big monsters added a fantasy element that made the films better people killing each other is thus real and less fun . a nice philosophy and a true shame that band , having destroyed the full moon studio through possible shoddy business dealings became so desperate for home cinema profits that he started making exactly what the likes of blockbuster wanted and therefore sacrificed creativity and originality . the team behind this one also worked on would elta delta die ! and birth rite both equally bland by full moon standards . debbie rochon is on usual top form here as a newbie to a gang of dudes and dudettes who decide to make up a story about a murder club . she as one would obviously does all she can to join and then panic sets in because it was not a true story and silly ms rochon believed it and now everybody will have to run around getting covered in blood and maybe killing each other or maybe not . the choice is there's and with regard to this movie its recommended but not entirely bad either .
1			porn	soft	movie	awful	you	bored	acting	bad	i	proud no			this is not michael madsen's fault , he was hardly in it . this movie was just awful . if you want to laugh and be bored , go ahead and watch this movie . words cannot describe how idiotic it is . sorry michael . the cinematography was dark . all the other actors are unknowns . when watching it , it feels like a soft porn , but with no nudity or heated scenes . this movie had sexual overtones , since it is about a underground s & m killer . the acting was bad , except michael madsen's parts . he looked like he wanted to laugh . i hope he got paid well for this lousy movie . it is something i would not be proud of . it is not even a b movie for cable , it is more like a f and it should never be shown , ever .
1			pixelated	little	shots	silly	opera	horrendous	it	interesting	depth	real	they	real no	girls	original	trail	old	trail	easy	need	serious	kissing	french	thing	good	liners	comic	opera	little			who me ? no , i m not kidding . that's what it really says on the video case . plot ; short version pretty woman stands around smiling . this , for some reason , makes all men kill each other . find ariel . where's not find ariel . she's right behind you , you idiot . most of what can be said about this horrendous little space opera has already been said , looks like . a bunch of corny actors playing mostly convicts come in after the first selection of actors is knocked off very quickly . then they get knocked off in the same way . every scene is broadcast nearly fifteen minutes in advance . perhaps it was a drawing of straws to see which actors had the most screen time and bigger pay check . the alien virus / hologram / vr witch / glitch seems physically powerless and doesn not do a thing . why can not she just stay in the computer instead of doing her teleporting vampire routine ? actually , it would have been more interesting if she had been a vampire , or doing more than just standing around looking at people , which is all she ever does . this is enough to make all the men kill each other . go figure . this isn not really a space flick . there are far more shots of the old western trail , 1950 s easy rider trail , film noir's night club scene , even a jog on the beach in fantasy land , none of which has any real depth or even makes any sense . the night club scene is in black and white , of course . worked with the wizard of oz . doesn not work so well , here . this is probably a good thing , as those few shots they do show of space are depressingly silly . you will probably cry during those moments , especially upon seeing that swirling space ship , which looks about three inches long . nothing is felt for any of the characters , not because they are convicts or have no personality , but because they are in serious need of acting lessons , except for billy dee williams who really does look depressed and at a loss , probably by being in this work . this is one of those movies that , when viewed with friends , is going to cause some extremely loud silences , especially when the nerd throws out his attempt at comic one liners including the line about french kissing a meteor . did i hear that right ? perhaps not . the original virtual reality girls get killed , which means nothing , as they are not even real to begin with . well , the other characters aren not , either , but that's beside the point . haha . what's kind of funny is that the scene that graces the video case is some sort of skull horror alien looking thing green filter added on top of that , to give it more of look , which is actually the android after he gets killed and ultimately has nothing to do with anything else afoot . another odd deal i noticed . whenever there is an explosion at least on my cheap dvd copy , everything becomes highly pixelated . i don not mean a little pixelated , i mean huge blocks about 1 16 h the size of the screen . wow .
1			stuff	strong	garbage	derivative			few films have left me with such a feeling of unease , and this is not a compliment . since i saw it in a theater how it ended there i can only wonder i was subjected to 90 mn of hateful , derivative garbage , the main impression being a bit like this other sick o movie don not answer the phone but worse . the nastiness of it all , rape and all , is shown without any distance unlike strong stuff like last house on the left and utter contempt for the perfect ? victims and everybody involved , leaving the viewer to be treated as a sadistic voyeur . at the end i felt like taking a shower . no credits to the director

1			inaccuracies	serious	testament	new			although the director tried the filming was made in tynisia and morocco , this attempt to transport the new testament in the screen script has serious inaccuracies and fantasies , while the duration is very the most tragic is the protagonist chris sarandon , who doesn not seem to understand the demands of his role .

1			airwaves	open	daylight	broad	ms	worst	soldiers	german	mission	active	you	surprised	army	active			this movie is a waste of film stock . do you believe that the map of a plan of a military mission would be placed on an easel on a patio in broad daylight for anyone with binoculars or a camera with a zoom lens to see ? it happened in this film . do you believe that a deaf person would actually be enlisted in the active duty army in europe during wwii to serve in a negro unit . cooking , supply services , burial detail , etc ? it happened in this film . do you believe that a black and supposedly intelligent officer would select this same deaf k . p . to be part of an active combat mission to protect a dam from being destroyed by the germans before the allies arrived ? it happened in this film . would you be surprised that the deaf soldier didn not realize that a german plane was approaching from behind and would strafe and kill him ? it happened in this film . would you be surprised that a group of american soldiers hold up in a barn at a farmhouse that the germans happened upon would shout out their emotions at the sight of the german soldiers who were just 50 away ? they did it in this film , and left any possible entrances to the barn the germans might check totally unprotected . would you believe that , over the airwaves and in clear english , the captain mentioned the general's rank , if not his name , as the person he was speaking with and that the general , in plain english over open airwaves , said that the dam had to be protected the next day ? maybe they should have just sent in an emissary to tell which direction the american attack would be coming from just to make it a little easier on the germans . this so called movie should be placed on a list of the top 50 worst fil ms if it were , i m sure it would do well . watch it at your own risk .
1			writing	predictable	script	bad	script	due	music	bad			don not waste 90 minutes of your time on fast food , fast women . it's annoyingly episodic script with three story lines patched together is laughably bad due to predictable writing , horrific acting , and even bad music . i found the anorexic main character upsetting to watch every time she was on screen . she needs the fast food . spend the 90 minutes you would devote to this turkey doing something more trimming your toenails . you would have more entertainment value . the only redeeming thing about this film is louise lasser , but she deserves much better than this tired script . it's as impotent as the elder guy she courts in the movie . viewer beware !
1			felt	sorry	off	obnoxious	movie	awful	you	happy			well this movie is amazingly awful . i felt sorry for the actors involved in this project because i m sure they did not write their lines . which were sometimes delivered with slight sarcasm , which lead me to believe they were not taking this movie seriously , nor could anybody who watches this obnoxious off beat monster slasher . while watching this creature unknown i could not help but think that there was not much of a budget or a competent writer on the crew . but , if you go into watching this for a laugh you will be happy , the movie is shameless to mocking itself because i cant see how anybody could look at this and be proud of pumping this straight to dvd clichd wanna be action thriller / horror movie fightfest to light .
1			fans	big	plot	bad	movie	stupid	plot	pathetic	comedy	intentional no	performance	good			now , i hired this movie because brad dourif was in it . he is an excellent actor , brilliant in everything . except this movie . and i think that was only because he realized how stupid this movie was , and didn not bother with a good performance . this movie is a unintentional comedy . some of the lines just crack me up . and them there are some lines that make no sense , and it seems like tobe hooper just throw lines in without thinking about the plot . oh ! btw the plot is bad ! but it one of those films that is taht bad that its actually painful to watch . i recommend this only for big brad dourif fans , or fans of any of the other actors , because the plot is pathetic .

1			criminals	low	bit	good	terrorist	real			a trio of low life criminals , led by matt dillon , botches a late night burglary . they flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrori st of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist , the real terrorist gets away , and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar , taking hostages , unaware why the police are so intent on catching them . and guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night ? unbelievable ? absolutely . and it goes down hill from there . spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent ; matt dillon , faye dunaway , gary sinise , viggo mortensen , and emmett walsh , but they are all wasted . mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar , all they do for the remainder of the film is argue . endlessly and aimlessly . long before the conclusion of the film you have stopped giving a damn about what happens to them .

1			talk	bad	it	hate	it	campy			whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome . otherwise , this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor her downward phase , and richard burton his miscasting phase . tennessee williams wrote the milk train doesn not stop here anymore and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play but apparently , he was the only one . taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money . whatever , it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner , exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears . it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a must see kind of thing . but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand , you are way ahead of me . sadly , this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress , even after winning two oscars . for burton , it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb . judge for yourself if you dare .

1			choice	wrong	acting	great	stars	big	look	ugly	stars	great	characters	realistic	me	disappointed			absolutely the most boring movie i have ever spent my money was a wrong choice for all these great stars to waste their reputations on . boring ! boring ! boring ! each character was portrayed in a less than inspirational way . no acting talent shown just reading a part . alec can play realistic characters normally , gwynyth made herself look ugly for an unrewarding part , annette needs advise on how to pick the movies she chooses to play in as do all these big stars who have left me disappointed at the way they have all allowed their talents to be smothered in a feature that leaves much to be desired in entertainment . running with scissors leads the public to anticipate great acting in a film that suggests experiencing tension and deep emotion . there was not one moment when the cast was able to portray any interpretation of this onto the screen . maybe it was the director's fault whatever .
1			standards	ordinary	film	inspired no	gordon	best	sequences	worth	bomb	good	director	good	crook	young	things	illogical	script	weak	scenes	poor	performances	average			you can not imagine how i looked forward to king of the ants . as a massive gordon fan , i awaited the european premiere with wicked anticipation . especially since i loved dagon gordon's last achievement so much . king of the ants premiered here in my country and it was gordon himself who came to present it . unfortunately , i couldn not go and congratulate him for it afterwards . king of the ants is his most uninspired and mediocre film to date . really , the quality level never surpassed ordinary tv thriller standards . the plot outline is terribly routine and with the exception of a few poor scenes , the typical gordon touch is never recognized . on top of that , the already weak script has more holes than a swiss bowl of cheese ! it involves a young wannabe crook who's hired to commit a murder . so he of course they are not paying of course he falls in love with the victim's of course he avenges himself . only the sequences in which the guy descents in a spiral of madness are worth a mention and they are the only ones reminding you of the fact you are still watching a stuart gordon film . the acting performances are below average with mccenna as the heroic lowlife , george `norm peterson wendt as the chubby bastard and kari wuhrer as the good hearted sex bomb . extremely illogical things happen constantly and the dullness of the story becomes irritating very quickly , while the make up effects aren not enough to even satisfy amateur horror fans . i read a few other comments on king of the ants , claiming it's gordon's best since it finally is a thought provoking and mature , if that's the case . i rather stay immature and give re animator another viewing , thank you very much . oh well , i guess every good director runs out of steam and inspiration bad it also overcame stuart gordon .
1			it	long			nine minutes of psychedelic , pulsating , often symmetric abstract images , are enough to drive anyone crazy . i did spot a full frame eye at the start , and later some birds silhouetted against other colors . it was just not my cup of tea . it's about 8 minutes too long .

1			movie	worst	code	dead			i can not say that wargames the dead code is the worst movie i have ever seen , as it had one or two decent moments , but i can easily say it's the most transparent movie i have ever seen . not once did a plot device present itself without me guessing it 10 minutes in advance . there was no subtlety to anything the movie did , no intelligence evident at all behind the scenes . every spoken or typed line's intent was so glaringly obvious it was impossible to get into the movie . i found myself laughing at the horribly thought out plot line , and the bumbled attempts to reclaim the audience , far more often than i found myself enjoying the movie .
1			writing	bad	example	good	newspaper	daily			this film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny tv sitcom . in puerto rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film , almost silencing all others . coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners . the weekly claridad is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film's form and content , and pointed out all its flaws , clichs , and bad writing . just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes , and because one can recognize actors and scenery , does not make it an acceptable film .
1			effects	silly	effects	special	mansion	creepy			well i have to admit this was one of my favorites as a kid , when i used to watch it on a home projector as a super -8 reel . now there isn not much to recommend it , other than the inherent camp value of actors being terrified by replicas of human skulls . the special effects are pretty silly , mostly consisting of skulls on wires and superimposed ghost images . but there's something to be said for the sets . the large mansion in which it takes place is pretty creepy , especially since it's mostly unfurnished probably due to budgetary reasons ? it definitely inspires more laughs than screams , however . just try not to get the giggles when the wife who does more than her share of screaming goes into the greenhouse and is confronted with the ghost of her husband's ex .
1			kirk	different	acting	terrible	director	different	acting	average	humor	terrible	humor	funny no	i	glad	affect	little	job	great	movie	ok	movie	great			i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was . i am so glad i didn not pay to see this movie and that i didn not sit in a movie theater for this one . where to begin on this movie , the acting in this movie was average , the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn not special . i thought that this movie was suppose to be great , but it wasn not more than a cheesy waste of time . i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry , it just wasn not there . i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn not get the feeling that he wasn not acting in this movie . now , alice eve did a great job as an actress but , there was no chemistry between her and jay . all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie . the humor in this movie was not funny at all , there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand . i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn not decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy . i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials . i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director . the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality , but what a letdown nothing . i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie . i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie . so save yourself the agony and just don not see it .
1			it	hard	parker	great	i	bored	grim	comical	budget	low	parker	good	fay	painful			it's hard to believe that this is a sequel to henry fool . hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies . while henry fool is refreshing , witty , comical , fay grim is slow , boring , and doesn not go anywhere . where has the wit gone ? i am baffled . it is 10 years since i saw henry fool and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory . fay grim is painful to watch . this is no fault of the actors , who are good parker posey or great jeff goldblum the blame lies entirely with the plot , the dialog , and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse . a huge disappointment . sorry i couldn not pay attention to the plot , i was so bored , so disappointed . if you enjoyed this one you might not enjoy henry fool so much . the two movies have absolutely nothing to do with each other . there is no continuity in the characters personalities . it's all a fraud to entice fans of henry fool to watch the sequel . i m switching this off now henry in some sort of jail with a taliban ? !
1			star	irrelevant	film	famous	hopes	real	rise	traditional	song	old	films	good	incomprehensible	frantic	difference	big	name	bad	mess	dreary	it	meaningless	graphics	necessary no			unlike others , i refuse to call this pitiful excuse for a movie a triumph of style over substance i don not want to give style a bad name . still , it's the most apt description that comes to mind . a pointless , unpleasant and ultimately meaningless assault on the eyes and ears , wonderland leaves one wondering only why the film was made in the first place and who in their right mind gave the greenlight to this dreary and tangled mess . a biography of porn star john holmes ? a study of who the man was , why he went into the business and how it affected him ? great . bound to be compelling , bound to be entertaining . bound to be enlightening and fascinating on about a million levels and i have zero interest in porn . but a confusing , violent , rashomon style study of a series of murders holmes was connected with after his career ended ? who in hell cares ? what insights do we gain ? this film completely ignores the most interesting aspect of john holmes's life that he was a porno star ! wonderland might as well have been about anyone the fact that the main character is the most famous male adult film star in history is almost irrelevant . to make matters about a thousand times worse , the picture is loaded down with jerkoff gimmicks annoying machine gun editing , sloppy dogme -95 camerawork , unnecessary split screen graphics and animation , etc etc in the absence of a compelling story and unique main character , the director and i use the term loosely has thrown together a dozen or so techniques from other films and decided to call the resulting mess a movie , among these the trendy , bleach bypass look of narc or traffic or minority report ; the frantic , often incomprehensible , throw the pieces of film in the air cutting style of natural born killers or 28 days later ; the fill every moment of silence with an old song to evoke the period soundtrack of goodfellas or blow ; the groovy , retro title sequence of velvet goldmine or autofocus or catch me if you can . the list goes on and on and on . pathetic . i wanted to like this movie . i had real hopes for it . wonderland avenue had been around for years ; had the context of the murders been emphasized rather than the murders themselves , i think it could have worked . had the murders and holmes's growing involvement with seedy l . a . types signaled the end of a career , or the end of the swinging 70 , i think the film could have had meaning ; it could have served a purpose . as it is meaningless . pointless . who cares how many perspectives exist on a series of murders generally unknown by the public ? the case isn not famous enough to merit such painstaking examination . this film should have been the third act of the john holmes story . that's it . period . and it could have worked . what's that ? oh , right , right , they didn not want to tell a traditional rise and fall story . they didn not want to make boogie nights or goodfellas or star 80 or autofocus . they wanted their film to be different . right ? well , in one sense , they succeeded . there's a big difference between those films and wonderland . the difference is those films are good .
1			daniels	contemporary			i guess you have to give some points for the sheer courage of writing a musical around a history lesson but how about some decent music ? is the cartoonish acting of howard desilva meant to pique the interest of otherwise jaded children ? is william daniels campy contemporary for the time acting style meant to appeal to a 1960 / 70 demographic ? do we need all the in jokes about ny & nj ? i can hear the blue haired broadway audience guffawing on cue . sorry , i find the whole piece dated , boring & the acting far too strident for the screen
1			fights	obnoxious	character	single	adaptation	good	characters	different	buddy	drunk			i never expect a film adaptation to follow too closely to the novel especially a beloved one , like evening but when i saw that the book's author , susan minot , was a screenplay writer and executive producer on the film , i thought that evening would be a good adaptation . if you enjoyed the book , don not bother with this movie . it is so far afield of the book that the two hardly bear any resemblance to one another . here , our characters are completely different the bride is in love with harris . harris is the son of the housekeeper . buddy is a drunk , in love with ann and / or harris . i don not think a single character made it from the book to the screen ; oh it just gets worst with every passing moment . and , really , didn not we learn from bridges of madison county that cutting from the story we are meant to be enthralled in , to scenes of our heroes grown children having obnoxious and juvenile fights , simply does not work on film ? this film is a disaster . skip it .
1			theme	old	it	nice	lenz	fun	stomach	strong	holden	old	citizens	senior			you have a strong stomach . holden was actually 55 years old at filming but looked near 70 and he only lived another 8 years . at one point holden said , i am over twice your age . okay , try triple grandpa ! the old enough to be your father theme they were shooting for didn not work . granted senior citizens sometimes wind up with legal teens . more power to them , but that doesn not mean i want to watch it . it's not a matter of judgment but the digestive track . i like my food where it belongs . lenz is fun to watch and the 70 cars , clothes , furniture , etc make it worth it if it comes on cable late at night and you want to watch something to wind down for bed . it would have been nice to see the blonde friend of lenz , the one who hocked her guitar , get more scenes . pleasingly spacey . who was this chick ? i m going to try and find out .
1			it	funny	version	horrible	they	entertaining	premise	funny no	sign	good			one question why ? first off , the premise is not funny or engaging at all . they use taped interviews , and take the audio to animate ite with animals speaking the parts . first off , the interviews aren not funny or entertaining to begin with , and even if they were , i am sure they would be a lot more entertaining being viewed as they are originally , without being turned into cartoons . how does that add any hilarity to it ? i turned on cbs's monday night sitcom line up , which has become a regular way for me to relax after stressful monday workdays and found this on . of course , the sitcom line up would be reruns anyway , being summer , but seeing those episodes over again would have been more entertaining . i tried to give cc a chance . i really did . when it started , i figured , well , maybe it will be funny . nope . and then it kept going . it was a long half hour . and i can almost see if there was a purpose , if the interviews were shown in their entirety , and had points to them . but no , it was just one line clips , cut and pasted together really quick . it was like a horrible dreadful version of cartoon network's robot chicken . i wasn not a fan of cbs now cancelled sitcom the class . while that was on , it was one half hour of the line up i would struggle through . but if it came down to me deciding a whole season of that or three more episodes of creatures 's just say i would take the class . considering it's been a couple hours since it aired , and i come on here to see i am the first to comment . i guess that's a good sign that nobody watched it , and that it won not last much longer . cartoon roadkill .
1			lighting	poor	shots	poor	version	old	film	bad	plot	good			i think that the shots and lighting were very poor . when i watched it for the first time i thought it was the old version 1956 . when i really found out the true year of the film i was shocked . i didn not know that there could be such a bad film made so recently . thats really all i wanted to say . this film had a good plot though , nothing you couldn not miss out on if you would simply read the novel that george orwelll wrote . all i really want to say has already been said except for this i can not believe that this film could have possibly received so many awards and nominations . i gave this film a one awful , because i felt that it was very badly made . well that is all . so long
1			clothing	worst	woman	naked			from the start of this movie you soon become aware that the name of the film has nothing to do with the movie itself from watching a naked woman being chased by people in very silly masks to servants running round in the worst clothing i have ever seen and all this in subtitles makes this the kind of movie you should think twice about seeing and as the film slowly moves along you soon realise that the vampire is not a vampire you got to wonder where the title came from some parts of the film made a bit of sense with pierre and is father but as the film gets to its really silly ending you have got to think why end a film this way and surly they had a better ending if only in there heads this is not a film to watch basically
1			couple	young			the producers of this film offer to pay funeral expenses for anyone who dies of fright while watching this movie . they should have offered intensive psychotherapy for anyone who really enjoyed this stinker . a young couple moves into a house , where a woman who looks like the woman from the couple lived . extremely boring , and very predictable . in the end i ended up not caring about anyone in this movie . avoid this one at all costs .
1			way	wrong	actor	good no	it	suck	guys	bad	characters	hate	displays	worst	personas	stereotypical	guys	hate			i registered just to make this comment which pretty much echos some of the ones here already the acting is worse than subpar , it expounds on commonly held stereotypes , has some of the worst displays of tasteless female objectification all bod no brain , and has some of the cheesiest lines known to man . including but not limited to allright lets see what these guys can do i should also mention that when they show the crashes involving innocent civilians , you end up feeling bad for the innocent people and start to hate the characters themselves . eddie griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical black guy personas that just rubs people the wrong way . he may or may not be a good actor but this movie doesn not allow for that kind of character exploration . you want a movie that leaves the audience on the side of the bad guys ? oceans 11 this movie just makes you hate the bad guys instead of capturing the audience . even the cars can not make up for this fluke of a movie . that enzo that griffin wrecked sums up this movie perfectly . it just sucks .
1			russell	awful	russell	believable	performance	pitiful	movies	worst	rest	terrible			this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen . robin williams fit into the part like a rhino would fit into a tutu , even so his performance was still pitiful . kurt russell was more believable but still was awful . the plot left much to be desired and the rest of the acting was also terrible . the only thing this movie had going for it was the trailer , which suckered me in to wasting 90 minutes of my life which could have been better spent trying to lick the back of my head . do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you have it . if not , just be happy you don not .
1			he	implausible	she	good	looks	good	looks	great			his costume drama is ill cast and without charm . george sanders was a superb character actor . but he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead , an eighteenth century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks . his costar is , of all people , akim tamiroff . some frenchman ! then there's signe hasso , in a dark wig , as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family . carole landis fares be st the movie opens with her in silhouette . she is a soubrette , and a naughty girl at that . she disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation . but she's good . she was always an appealing actress . here she is cast closest to her usual type of role . it's meant to be a little naughty , kind of ooh la la . it ought to have had a light touch but it's a leaden affair from start to finish .

1			career	entire			once again , pia zadora , the woman who owes her entire career to her husband , proves she can not act . this disaster of a film butchers the harold robbins novel . ray liotta must have been hogtied and carried to the set to appear in this one . avoid this at all costs . i doubt even doing the mst 3 thing would save it .
1			bit	little	seemed	suitable	lots	big			wow . where to begin . picked this up at big lots for only $ 2.99 that's three bucks i will never see for what ? i will tell ya . an hour and fifteen minutes of boring , boring , boring chat and college angst that seemed more suitable for a lifetime movie than the horror flick advertised on the box . may the marketing droids who designed it burn in hell for all eternity . follow that up with a little bit of cheap gore not even good gore mind you . and a plot twist at the end that comes out of nowhere , and makes no sense . awful , awful , awful . was there any redeeming qualities ? well , on the joe bob briggs scale , there were six breasts involved , but that's hardly worth my long lost three bucks . without those , this coulda been on sci fi at , say , two or three in the morning . bmoviefreak
1			it	hate	writing	shallow	life	real	style	similar	editing	horrible	i	glad	editing	choppy	examples	good	overuse	poor			i was very excited about this film when i first saw the previews . normally i see a preview this good and i buy the film outright . something told me to . you know watch it fir st i m glad i did . keira knightley ruined all future films for me with this role . in the 2 d pirates movie when it came out i went to see it . all i saw was domino harvey and i hated her more for it . i think that had to do with her hair and having to cut it short for dominumber domino who ? who is domino harvey ? i still don not really know or care . i don not know who she was in real life or who she was in this film . i didn not care about her character and even keira getting partically naked didn not make it worth the movie . the direction was definitely lacking . the writing was trite and shallow . the editing was horrible . i don not mind the style so much as the poor overuse of it . there's a place for it . good examples of choppy , mtv style , colorful editing not sure if there's an official name would be fight club ; just off the top of my head . even enemy of the state had a semi similar editing style at parts . it was used tastefully and wasn not used as a crutch . i mean this is the same guy who directed top gun and crimson tide . tony scott please give me my time back . i understand there are many people who liked this movie . i guess the idea that you will either completely love this movie or completely hate it is a fair assessment . frankly , i hate it .
1			world	deep	seems	dated	hanks	young	splash	big	version	live			the subject matter seems pretty dated today . adapted for tv from rona jaffe's book ; we trip and stumble through a fantasy existence . four college students get deeply involved playing a live version of the board game mazes and dragons based on dungeons and dragons . one player , a young tom hanks , enters the fantasy world too deep . his co players must come to his rescue and save him from self inflicted harm . david wallace , wendy crewson and chris makepeace round out the game's foursome . support cast is made up of veteran actors like murray hamilton , vera miles , anne francis and susan strasberg . at this date , it seems lumbering and tame . but the highlight of watching is seeing tom hanks between his bosom buddies salad days and his big splash in splash on the silver screen . the youngest of viewer will get most enjoyment .
1			dialog	terrible	material	good	acting	bad	movie	laughable	video	bad			this was one of the most boring horror movies that i have ever seen . a college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at alcatraz . trying to deliver a mix of nightmare on elm street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80 music video , this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story . although , being such a bad , and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog , it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of mystery science theater 3000 don not be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the silver scroll award by the academy of sicence fiction , fanatasy , and horror , or that devo contributes to the soundtrack , or that tony basil has a part in the film . it is a giant disaster , though one with a small cult following see the other imdb comments for this film .

1			effects	special	system	nearest	sense	good	idea	idiotic	it	fascinating			this is one of the silliest movies i have ever had the misfortune to watch ! i should have expected it , after seeing the first two , but i keep getting suckered into these types of movies with the idea of maybe they did it right this time . nope not even close . where do i begin ? how about with the special effects . to give you an idea of what passes for sfx in this movie , at one point a soldier is shooting at a raptor as it runs down a hallway . even with less than a second of screen time , the viewer can easily see that it is just a man with a tail apparently taped to him running around . bad bad bad bad . how about the acting ? if that's what you can call it . there is one character who , i suppose , is supposed to be from the south . however , after living in the south for six years now , i have never heard this way of talking . perhaps he has some sort of weird disability the inability to talk normally . i find it fascinating that the character does nothing that requires him to have that accent therefore there was no reason for the actor to try to do one . how about the plot ? it's pretty basic raptors escape , people with guns must hunt them down . i m starting to wonder why the dinosaurs in these movies always seem to run into the nearest system of tunnels . wouldn not they stay outside to hunt prey ? oh well , at least they have the good sense to appear very very little in the movie which supposedly revolves around them . other things let's say you are in a building and you know that there are man eating raptors running around in it . would you decide to take time out to have an argument about who is better army or marine ? and then decide to have an arm wrestling contest to settle it ? how about the idiotic idea that they have to track down the raptors split up into groups of two . didn not they ever watch any horror movies or at least an episode of scooby doo ? in short , this is one of the dumber movies out there . miss it unless you want to groan your way through a movie .
1			film	sweet	film	annoying	it	amusing	intentions	good			the best that i can say about this film is that it was mildly amusing at times , and that it was an adequate time killer . unfortunately , this film is also so annoying that i wanted to slap these characters around . this is the kind of film that is so sweet , it hurts your teeth . the intentions were good , i suppose , but things get awfully tiresome when the dialogue is so nauseating . when the two leads aren not together on screen , this really isn not bad at all , but be afraid during those frequent moments when the loving couple starts talking to one another .
1			payoff	predictable	bugs	funny	weg	good	director	great	elmer	good	night	good	elmer	boring	cartoon	long			i am really shocked that a great director like chuck jones started out making some of the most incredibly boring cartoons i have ever seen . i did not laugh once throughout this short , and it's a bugs bunny cartoon , for christ's sake ! bugs bunny cartoons are always funny , not boring ! alas , this short turns out to be good night elmer another incredibly boring jones short with the addition of bugs bunny . the first warning sign of a dull cartoon is always no gag payoff . good night elmer was boring because it dragged on the same two gags forever with predictable payoff . this cartoon , on the other hand , is afflicted with the second warning sign of a dull cartoon there's too much dialogue . the cartoon at least has more than two gags up its sleeve , but most of them seem longer than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue . at one point , elmer finishes eating dinner , and comments , that was weawwy awfuwwy good weg of wamb , possibly the most redundant dialogue i have ever heard in a cartoon characters reading text out loud in the later era woody woodpecker cartoons doesn not count in my book . even though this cartoon is only 8 minutes long , it feels like 20 thanks to redundant dialogue like this . elmer's pet rabbit was not a fun cartoon for me , but if you have sold your soul to chuck jones and are unable to acknowledge that he directed a few clunkers during his career , you might enjoy it .
1			star	big	interludes	musical	collection	new	stars	lucky			this oddity in the new doris day collection doesn not really need to be included as she is only in the film for less than 30 minutes . what she does do however , is shine when she's on screen . the near plot less movie is just an excuse to showcase some warner contract players of the day . jancie rule shows promise and it's a shame she didn not become a big star . ruth roman handles the role of the go getter with aplomb . better if this was in color . the travis air force base locations with some rear projection work well . what's best about the movie are some wonderful musical interludes . if you enjoyed thank your lucky stars and hollywood canteen you will like this one .
1			pity	constant	me	wrong	mate	potential			i have tried to like this film , really . in watching it , all i can think is , this guy gives me the creeps , i would have gotten a restraining order . it also calls out codependence in capital letters . was this really the conversation before making the movie ? let's make a film that puts two chronically depressed , socially inept people into a relationship which deepens their isolation and encourages them to complain about how bad their lives are ! from what i have seen in life is that the last thing on earth we find attractive in a potential mate is constant self pity . the mood of the movie is distinctly 80 ish ; brooding and slow . don not get me wrong , the film has its moments , just very few of them .
1			infancy	intellectual	joke	good	indication	good	film	good	it	worth no			warning ! don not even consider watching this film in any form . it's not even worth downloading from the internet . every bit of porn has more substance than this wasted piece of celluloid . the so called filmmakers apparently have absolutely no idea how to make a film . they couldn not tell a good joke to save their lives . it's an insult to any human being . if you are looking for a fun filled movie go look somewhere else . let's hope this mr unterwaldt the jr . being a good indication for his obvious inexperience and intellectual infancy dies a slow / painful death and never makes a film again . in fact , it's even a waste of time to write anything about this crap , that's why i will stop right now and rather watch a good film .
1			fillings	mixed			i being of puertorican descent , had mixed fillings about this documentary . first i was offended that ms perez compared senor campos to che guevarra . also just a point of fact , mr john leguzaimo is not of puertorican parents came from columbia . whomever did research on this was not very accurate . i feel that the future of our race rests on education . this message should have been resounding throughout this film , education is our road to freedom and power i think any future endeavors of this production team should make this their my opinion , this film swayed toward an anti american sentiment .
1			movies	offensive	eyes	dead	other	significant	viewers	potential			looking through the other comments , i m amazed that there aren not any warnings to potential viewers of what they have to look forward to when renting this garbage . first off , i rented this thing with the understanding that it was a competently rendered indiana jones knock off . what i got was one of the most offensive movies i can remember trying to sit through , made all the more shocking by the movie's comparatively high production values . i don not think this is a spoiler , but if it is , be warned . if your idea of entertainment is watching bimbo getting raped from behind by fearsome tribal chief , while she is staring into the dead eyes of her significant other's severed head , by all means , rent this flick . if not , i would advise you to look elsewhere for entertainment . come to think of it , that scene so succinctly sums up the movie that there's nothing else i really need to say about it .
1			sharpshooters	famous	minutes	good	life	precious	movie	bad			non existent plot , tons of poorly directed / super cheesy scenes snipers / world famous sharpshooters who can not even hit their targets a few feet away ? plus what's up with the ending ? a bunch of law enforcers vandalizing a carnival's shooting gallery ? wth ? technical mistakes how many bullets can you fit into a magazine of a glock ? 100 ? these people fire their guns without the need of reloading . the movie is so bad that even senior hollywood actor like michael biehn aliens , terminator can not save this junk . do not watch this movie i realized that i wasted some good 100 minutes of my precious life on this one . hopefully the director would either stop making movies , or learn more for his next movie .
1			samaritan	good	acting	good			this movie starts out with a certain amount of promise ; but , in my view , begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down . that this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough , but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family's life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories . i found this movie average at be st art direction could have been much better , as could have been cinematography . the acting was good , and so was eva van der gucht's singing .
1			movie	good	accent	horrible	johnson	good	i	wrong	movie	entire	book	good			as i said , the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if melissa gilbert hadn not been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll . what kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway ? it sounded the same as her horrible russian accent in another movie that i have seen her in . every time she opened her mouth i cringed . it took 3 tries before i was able to watch the entire movie . brad johnson was good as the other lead . i really liked the beach location scenes . they added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of melissa gilberts depressing portrayal . i think they could have used san francisco views more to their advantage though . it looked like the night scenes were actually sf , but i could be wrong . i don not recall the character in the book being this depressing . please keep melissa gilbert out of any future movies that require an accent !
1			tv	live	shot	musical	movie	bad	scenes	various	faces	new			this paramount version / ripoff of oklahoma ! / annie get your gun / calamity jane isn not all that unusual or innovative . the marketing and intro comments may be there to salvage what is really a pretty bad movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live tv show . i don not find the use of the background cyclorama , lit in various scenes with yellow , or pink , or red , that innovative . as noted , it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a tv budget all soundstage , with minimal sets backed by the lighted cycs ! compare to new faces of 1952 . the actors come off reasonably well , though . and this style was much better realized when paramount shot li l abner in 1959 of couorse , this movie suggests the often repeated question what were they thinking ?
1			premise	offensive	indulgence	obnoxious	collection	personal	book	erotic			writer / director peter greenaway cements his title as the high lord of art house pretension with his latest exercise in obnoxious self indulgence , 8 women . the film follows a wealthy englishman and his son on their mutual quest for sexual satisfaction , as they lure and blackmail women guess how many into joining their personal collection of concubines . think of any possible way that this premise could be offensive , and chances are greenaway's done it . the female characters are little more than a catalogue of fetishes for the two protagonists to partake of . there's the kabuki obsessed mio , the ever pregnant giaconda and beryl , who's got a thing for farm animals . giulietta has no legs and uses a wheelchair , she's the half woman , get it ? greenaway vehemently denies all accusations of misogyny , but if this isn not it , then what is ? the film goes on to eroticize anything and everything having to do with japan , a continuation of themes from his snore worthy but less sexist 1996 film , the pillow book . but where the the pillow book was erotic and graceful , 8 women just gets horny and exploitative . greenaway's work is tasteless and arrogant in its fetishism , and the only person likely to enjoy watching it is the auteur himself .
1			i	glad	film	hate	idea	good	i	bored			i m glad some people liked this , but i hated this film . it had a very good idea for a story line , but that's where it ended . it was badly written , badly acted and badly made . it had some interesting plot points , but they were just skipped over too fast , the writers needed to realize what to keep in and expand on these bits , like lying about why she was kidnapped , and ditch the dross . instead it was what's going on ? 5 seconds later they tell you . this film had no suspense , and i was bored from start to end . i just wanted it to finish . go and rent misery , or best laid plans if you want suspense or twists that keep you guessing to the end .
1			work	bad	music	loud	action	shoddy	acting	abysmal	editing	present no			absolutely awful movie . utter waste of time . background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech . well if you really listen closely , whatever they speak is actually unintelligible . camera work is bad , editing is not present , background score gives a headache , action is shoddy , dialogs are unintelligible , acting is abysmal and well kareena used to look like a wrestler , now she looks like a starved wrestler . hell you can slim down but you cannot gain grace . after spending three hours watching a movie i want to like it , but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure . please if you want to torture yourself , go ahead watch this .
1			nastie	nasty no	killings	gory no	nasties	famous			i m not looking for quality ; i m just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in britain . this one was initially banned and re released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut . some college kids spend their christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation . there are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids . which of them is the slasher ? the actual killings are not very gory , so this video nastie is not really nasty . there is the requisite flashing of the boobies , but it has nothing to do with the college kids . i had a suspect very quickly and i turned out to be right . maybe i have seen too many of these . the end twist was clever ; i have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality .
1			town	old	egg	big	talents	real	blouses	nice	i	disappointed	she	open	performance	grand	me	long	blouses	open	film	horrible no			very , very humdrum movie fare here with stella stevens taking directions from someone in disguise it didn not take me long to guess who it was in old nevada town outside vegas for a money heist in the circus circus hotel in las vegas . stevens leads her girl gang of three , and they find out that they must act much quicker than had been anticipated . despite some neat looks at las vegas in the 70 s , very average yet credible acting from most involved , and a plot line with potential , las vegas lady lays one big boring egg . it seems forever for the film to kick into gear , and when it does it just sputters here and there and never really speeds up . i was somewhat disappointed with this film . sure , i wasn not expecting anything great , but i at least thought this might be one of those neat exploitation films from the 70 s or something like it . not even close . no one dies . there is a lame gunfight between creaky stuart whitman and officious george dicenzo , one year prior to his grand performance as the prosecuting attorney bugliosa in helter skelter . the gunfight has all the suspense of watching a waterfall . there is one punch and one head hit with a blunt instrument . beyond that nothing in terms of action . and as for the girls , don not expect much there either . stella and her girls both very mediocre yet pretty talents , get in a sauna and a bath . what do we see ? nothing but a fleeting side profile . stella wears these nice open blouses accentuating her real talents , but i wish she would have been a bit more open with her performance . that way i could write one thing that would recommend the film . alas , it was not to be , and i have little to say in this film's favor . it isn not a horrible film in any way , it just has nothing going for it either . yawn .
1			performance	thoughtful	numbers	necessary no	unnecessary	identical	tunes	memorable	brando	young	fifties	expensive	songs	weak	screen	big	sets	big			nathan detroit runs illegal craps games for high rollers in nyc , but the heat is on and he can not find a secure location . he bets chronic gambler sky masterson that sky can not make a prim missionary , sarah brown , go out to dinner with him . sky takes up the challenge , but both men have some surprises in store this is one of those expensive fifties mgm musicals in splashy colour , with big sets , loud music , larger than life roles and performances to match ; broadway photographed for the big screen if you like that sort of thing , which i don not . my main problem with these type of movies is simply the music . i like all kinds of music , from albinoni to zz top , but broadway show tunes in swing time with never ending pah pah tah dah trumpet flourishes at the end of every fourth bar aren not my cup of tea . this was written by the tag team of frank loesser , mankiewicz , jo swerling and abe burrows based on a couple of damon runyon stories , and while the plot is quite affable the songs are weak . blaine's two numbers for example are identical , unnecessary , don not advance the plot and grate on the ears and are also flagrantly misogynistic if that sort of thing bothers you . there are only two memorable tunes , luck be a lady sung by brando , not sinatra as you might expect and sit down , you are rockin the boat nicely performed by kaye but you have to sit through two hours to get to them . the movie's trump card is a young brando giving a thoughtful , laid back performance ; he also sings quite well and even dances a little , and is evenly matched with the always interesting simmons . the sequence where the two of them escape to havana for the night is a welcome respite from all the noise , bustle and vowel murdering of noo yawk . fans of musicals may dig this , but in my view a musical has to do something more than just film the stage show .
1			movie	fantastic	movie	good	arguments	big	movie	greatest	movie	comic	relationship	personal	friends	new	things	worst	he	interesting no	job	dead	soul	single			i am quite a fan of novelist / screenwriter michael chabon . his novel wonder boys became a fantastic movie by curtis hanson . his masterful novel the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay won the pulitzer prize a few years back , and he had a hand in the script of spider man 2 , arguably the greatest comic book movie of all time . director rawson marshall thurber has also directed wonderful comedic pieces , such as the gut busting dodgeball and the genius short film series terry tate office linebacker . and with a cast including peter saarsgard , sienna miller , nick nolte and mena suvari , this seems like a no brainer . it is . literally . jon foster stars as art bechstein , the son of a mobster nolte who recently graduated with a degree in economics . jon is in a state of arrested development he works a minimum wage job at book barn , has a vapid relationship with his girlfriend / boss , phlox suvari , which amounts to little more than copious amounts of sex , with no plans other than to chip away at a career for which he has zero passion . one night at a party , an ex roommate introduces jon to jane miller , a beautiful , smart violini st later that night they go out for pie , and she asks jon a question that begins to shake him from his catatonic state of existence , i want you to tell me something that you have never told a single soul . if you do , it will make this night indelible . jon then tells her a reoccurring dream of his in which he wanders about town looking at the faces of strangers passing him by , yet none of them look him in the eye . i imagine it must be what death feels like , he says . the next day jane's wild boyfriend cleveland saarsgard kidnaps jon from work and takes him out to a hulking abandoned steel mill , and soon jon , cleveland and jane are spending every waking moment together going to punk rock concerts , doing drugs and drinking lots of alcohol . this doesn not sit well with phlox , who pushes jon for a more personal relationship , namely letting her meet his new friends and his father . the film then attempts to take us on jon's journey as he shakes off the shackles imposed on him by his father , phlox and his dead end job as he finds freedom and expression through his relationships with cleveland and jane . there is a problem having us follow jon throughout the film he's completely uninteresting . he has no ambitions , passions or goals . he walks through life like the invisible wraith he described to jane the night they met . at the outset this isn not a problem . but he never gets any more interesting . he's a completely passive character . he simply follows along the bohemian cleveland and jane , but he never once gives us any inkling as to what he cares about or wants to to do with himself . consequently , the film and its supporting characters have nowhere to go and little to do other than party , have sex and get in arguments . in other words , much ado about nothing . what we have here is the shallow skin of a good movie without anything on the inside . sweeping cinematography , ponderous voice over with characters staring off into the distance , lots of sex scenes both straight and gay , big arguments , more angry sex , a chase scene and a tragic death . but it doesn not seem to matter . ironically , at one point jane , confused at a number of jon's aimless actions , asks him , what's going on , jon ? what is this all about ? yes , jon , do tell . we in the audience are dying to know , too . the title the mysteries of pittsburgh must refer to the characters themselves , because that's what they are . they are all facades , one dimensional stand ins for actual people . the film never lets us in . we never know what makes any of them tick . we see them do lots of things , but we don not know why . and the absence of why is one of the worst things a movie can have .
1			i	mistaken	dragon	electric	additions	necessary no	movies	worst	film	terrible	percussion	constant	storyline	appealing	finale	awful			this is seriously one of the worst movies i have ever seen . i love japanese movies , and i think another film by the same director , electric dragon 80 000 v , is a masterpiece . i really wanted to like this movie asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing . but i couldn not find anything entertaining about it . the movie takes forever for nothing to happen . and the effects the director used like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion merely added to my growing annoyance at the fact that the plot was so mind bogglingly slow and the actors were heinously overacting . a lot of the boredom was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unnecessary like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn not worship anything . this added nothing to the plot . a fellow japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly . we couldn not believe this film was as terrible as it was . and the finale was awful . i thought the director would at least attempt to reward the viewer for managing to sit through this , but sadly i was mistaken .
1			movie	good	it	delightful	events	important	whole	delightful	way	successful	elizabeth	little			why do movie makers always go against the author's work ? i mean , yes , things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest , but look at anne of green gables . they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful . i can not believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess . look at all they missed out on by doing that . . paul irving , little elizabeth , the widows , windy poplars . . and anne's college years , for heaven's sake ! ! wouldn not it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang ? kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time , instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did . this movie was good , if you leave the novels out of it ! but l . m . montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied . this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life .
1			indians	little	script	atrocious	ending	longest	feel	sorry	pacing	bad			the movie has the longest , most tortured and agonized ending of any movie i have seen in a long time . unfortunately it starts right after the opening credits . january jones gives such a wooden performance , i was surprised she didn not go up in flames when she got near the candles in the film . i don not really remember her from the other films she's done a blessing i have to believe . i never criticize an actors performance because in film there are too many things which can affect it but in this case , it is so bad that it actually stands out from the atrocious script . granted she's given lines and situations meryl streep would have trouble with but i swear at times shes reading from a cue card off set . at other times i thought she might actually be learning disabled or slow in some way . for real ! the plot , dialog and pacing are as bad as you will ever see but there is still no excuse for this performance nor for the director that let it be perpetrated . i feel sorry for the other actors . cruel intentions / 10 little indians / breakfast club shoved into a rotten burrito then regurgitated by a grade school writer director . take that back this has studio exec crayola all over it .
1			use	daily	life	real	accent	heavy	song	original	costumes	poor			where do i start ? per the title of this film i expected some degree of authenticity , in the end i was severally let down . this is not the story of lale andersen or the song lili marlene , rather it is a hollywood or pick your film making hub story loosely based on some real life characters . i should have had a clue when i heard a heavy english accent giving the intro to the movie in german ; the blood red text title , artists should have been the 2 d clue . the story line is contrived lale was not tricked out of switzerland rolf liebermann's parents , there is no info that liebermann helped smuggle jews from germany , the original song had been recorded outside of the control of the ns regime not while under control , the record played at the station was picked up in vienna while a lt . was there on leave , etc , etc the costumes are poor and incorrect for the time frames ss black uniforms used every where from border guards to staff positions , these went away from daily use once the war started , etc , the characters are stereo types sa bullies in a club once they were essentially out of power . don not waste your time .

1			acting	horrible	movie	promising	movies	worst	reason	good			this by far one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life . i gave up to watch it after an hour and regretted that hour a lot . the acting is horrible and there is almost no plot . my guess is that someone came up with a strange shape of an animal and started to make a story around of it . borrowing some ideas from movies like resident evil and aliens doesn not result in a movie like them . if this going to be a top korean movie , i would rather won not bother to see even a korean movie trailer . by the way , this movies is a good reason to believe that not necessarily a high rating means the movie is promising . i think every korean who has internet for online gaming rated this movie over the 8 even though has no clue what it is about .

1			lover	new	story	bad	actors	bad	he	crazy	girls	real no	john	sick	thriller	erotic			being the only movie i was able to see at this year's nordische filmtage at lbeck , this year's festival will be remembered as a all time low for me . this movie , which was announced as an erotic thriller , is nothing more than a sick piece of crap ! excuse the language , but there aren not any decent words to describe it . first of all , the actors are not the be st but even better actors would not have rescued the movie . for example the plot after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick , the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend . the so called sex scene was nothing else but disgusting hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn not anything to do with sexuality , but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown . everything else was copied by other directors like for example lynch , but of course without their geniality . so , to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money guy loses girlfriend , girlfriend turns back home , guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards , guy imagines hot , but crazy neighbour girls , guy has very disgusting sex with one of them or so he thinks , in the end he realizes , he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time . bad story , bad actors , pictures , that make you want to vomit . 1 out of 10 1 point for the fact , that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish at least one benefit of the evening and you can not choose 0 points here .
1			jane	tolerable	points	strong			i love the book , jane eyre and have seen many versions of it . all have their strong points and their faults . however , this was one of the worst i have seen . i didn not care about jane or mr rochester . charlotte gainsbourg jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part , but she had no emotion in any of her lines . i couldn not imagine what mr rochester saw in her . that brings us to mr rochester . william hurt had even less emotion than jane , if that were possible . how two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery , but it certainly didn not hold my attention . perhaps the director zeffrelli fell asleep during the production . the timothy dalton too handsome for mr rochester ! version is far more faithful to the book , but ciaran hinds plays the perfect mr rochester in the 1997 a / e version which is not all that true to the book . trying to find something positive about this movie geraldine chaplain was perfect in her role .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			this is a very odd film . i wasn not really sure what is was about , some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all , in their own way , change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster . the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied , almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all . i didn not care about any of the characters none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer . what was the message ? am i being dim ? it was just too odd . what happens to runner ? why does emilio shoot the kid ? that made absolutely no sense , pointless . can someone help me understand this mess of a film ?
1			acting	laughable	casting	good no	plot	interesting	scenes	serious	scale	excellent	thing	worst	casting	disappointing	it	ridiculous			this movie was so poorly written and directed i fell asleep 30 minutes through the movie . the jokes in the movie are corny and even though the plot is interesting at some angles , it is too far fetched and at some points ridiculous . if you are 11 or older you will overlook the writing in the movie and be disappointed , but if you are 10 or younger this is a film that will capture your attention and be amazed with all the stunts which i might add are poorly done and wish you were some warrior to . the casting in this movie wasn not very good , and the music was very disappointing because it was like they were trying to build up the tension but it didn not fit at all . on a scale of 1 -10 10 being excellent , 1 being horrible the acting in this movie is a 4 brenda song is talented in comedy , but with this kind of movie , in some of the more serious scenes , her acting was laughable . when she made some of her fighting poses , i started laughing out loud . i think the worst thing about this movie is definitely the directing , for example , the part where her enemy turns out to be the person the evil villain is possesing , how her voice turns dark and evil , i think that was incredibly stupid , and how wendy's brenda song teachers were all her teachers at school being possessed by monks , that was pretty ridiculous to . so to sumamrize it all , a disappointing movie , but okay if you are 10 or under .
1			thing	good	it	boring	fan	big	movie	bad			i m a big fan of troma but i can not figure out why they bought the rights to this movie , it's so boring i felt like i was watching for 3 hours . some where on the plot summary it says but what satan doesn not know he's stuck with annoying tourists well they didn not seem to bother him in the movie , just me . the only good thing about this movie is the actor who plays satan , i like bad movie's but it was just boring .
1			felt	sorry	comment	social	works	complete	one	single	i	disappointed	i	prepared	sex	gratuitous	note	positive	punk	contemporary	members	various	thought	intellectual	flick	poor			at the time of writing this review it would seem that over 50 of imdb voters had given this film a rating of either a 10 or a 1 i can only surmise then that those giving it a 10 were either cast or crew members . they say that given enough monkeys and enough time and enough typewriters , those monkeys , just by random proddings at the keyboard , would eventually type out the complete works of shakespeare . however , i seriously doubt that given the same number of monkeys and time , you could find a single one to give this movie a rating of 10 i patiently watched the first half , foolishly assuming that the film would , on some level , develop either the plot or the characters , or maybe make some kind of social comment or provoke barely intellectual thought . failing that , i was quite prepared to accept action , suspense , comedy , horror or even gratuitous sex as a way of holding my attention . ultimately , i was disappointed and consequently , much of the second half was viewed at double speed as i searched in vain for some small snippet of cinematic redemption . sadly , there was none . if the choke , was put up against an episode of scooby doo then i m afraid the cartoon would win hands down in terms of mystery , intrigue and unpredictability . and speaking of cartoon characters , the acting abilities of the various cast members varied between acceptable at best and embarrassingly poor with brooke bailey's portrayal of the freaky , death obsessed pseudo goth , london , being so bad i almost felt sorry for her . i would have liked to have finished on a positive note but even the soundtrack , a second rate feast of contemporary punk rock , failed even to entertain , let alone serve to enhance a very poor flick .
1			rewrites	atrocious	scene	convincing no			this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i have ever viewed . if they want to make a movie with a lousy story , they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book . there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title . i don not mind changes if they help a story flow on screen . at least the changes shouldn not hurt the final product . the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing . the actors are misca st the director and / or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon . if you have seen this movie and disliked it , try the book . if you have seen this movie and liked it , read the book .
1			series	entire	show	entire	episode	worst			first of all i just want to say that i love this show ! ! but this episode makes a mockery of the entire show . i don not know what they tried to achieve with this episode but they successfully created the worst episode in the entire series . there is no story line , everything is chaotic and the crap . the way they tried to answer some of the remaining questions in the game . . for example how do the furlings look like by creating that stupid previously on . simply embarrassing . its clear that the writers are running out of ideas and that is really too bad .
1			parts	equal	part	bad	parts	interesting	europeans	capable	coverage	thin			this film is an attempt to present jared diamonds theory of guns , germs and steel , explaining how europeans have dominated much of the globe . the version i saw of this documentary came on 2 discs covering 3 hours . i think the information could have been presented in 20 minutes . there are completely useless scenes of professor jared diamond watching birds through binoculars , professor jared diamond failing to use a bow and arrow properly , professor jared diamond firing a muzzle loader badly . was this documentary supposed to make a hero out of professor jared diamond ? this part of the documentary was so bad , it could have been a spoof . the worst was when diamond is shown breaking down and weeping when touring the malaria ward in an african hospital . none of this helps me understand his theory of guns , germs and steel . btw , guns , germs and steel is said about 100 times . can the europeans guns , germs and steel get them out of this dire situation ? stay tuned and find out ! when he finally gets down to business , his theory is equal parts interesting and utterly boring . europeans conquered the natives peoples of other lands , because they had guns and fine blades against stone and wooden weapons . do i really need a professor to convince me of this ? the parts of his theory that explain how the europeans came to have the advantages that allow the conquest are interesting , but the coverage is paper thin . in the end , i think the documentary was only trying to convince me that non europeans are as capable as europeans . if i m not a racist , i already know this . if i m a racist , jared diamond is not going to convince me with his bumbling use of native implements . i don not think adults are the intended audience for this documentary . kids may enjoy this more than i , though . i have read that the book from which this documentary is much better than the documentary .
1			car	classic			spoilers ahead proceed at your own caution . my main problem with this movie is that once harry learns the identities of the three blackmailers with relative ease he continues to cave into their demands . and then the whole scene with his wife being kidnapped , he decides to wire his classic car up to explode with the money in it , which makes us take a pretty tall leap of logic . okay , so he wanted to keep his affair with cini out of the public eye due to his wife's involvement with the da campaign . this i can see , but why not hire someone to slap these turds around a bit , or even kill them once he would determined there was no actual blackmail evidence e . g , cini's body ? this was a pretty interesting movie for the first 2 3 of it . after that , it sort of falls apart .

1			movie	real	effects	nice	music	poor	actors	british	recall	total	audience	entire	results	poor	carter	awful	phrases	famous	film	worst	script	miserable	directors	big			absolutely the worst film yet by burton , who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs . a miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film . this is the kind of movie where every time something happens , you will be sure to hear someone shout out he's lost his gun ! or whatever it is to let everybody know . carter is really awful and so is wahlberg , who can not play this straight and be convincing . very nice effects and photography , but poor music in the john williams mold by burton's crony elfman . heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch phrases from the first movie . very poor results . if anyone else out there also saw sleepy hollow , they will probably have noticed , as i have , the declining quality of burton's fil ms i have heard that this particular project was produced by others and that burton was brought in as director , in which case his judgement should be questioned . but i think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip ; the evidence is there in the fil ms in sleepy hollow , he couldn not decide what kind of movie he was making , whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie , and the population of british character actors chris lee , etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary , as horror fans know . the movie couldn not succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic , and no style had been developed to smooth the two together . planet of the apes is much the same way , and the result comes off more like total recall or tango and cash than like sci fi . he's also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience . word to burton , if you are out there pick something and do it straight , or use some style to peice it all together as in mars attacks or beetlejuice or you might as well retire , because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going .
1			editing	excellent	scenes	specific	danes	intense	terms	artistic	cinematography	excellent	gere	intense			i really have problems rating this movie . it is directed brilliantly , there is obviously a lot of money in it . gere and danes are intense although her screen personality could use a bit more defining and spicing up , editing and cinematography are excellent . on the other hand , it is one of those really really sick movies where one cannot help but wonder whether the director himself likes to stage specific scenes , and , yes , one cannot help but wonder how many copycats will such a movie inspire . in purely artistic terms , it is a 9 but i really have to ask myself who these people are giving their money to produce such a movie .

1			others	boring			some movies are repellent but still fascinating pulp fiction ; others are simply boring . this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring . by the end i didn not care about any of the characters , i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre .
1			soundtrack	tedious	he	drunk	characters	interesting no	tradition	worst			what a disappointment ! this film seemed to be trying to copy cutting edge comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy , sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition . jack black's acting / role was self indulgent and self regarding . and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting . the soundtrack was tedious . we are were fans of black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration . why did he feel he needed to make this mistake ? we will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first ! was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel ?

1			potential	potential no	premise	great	member	hard	member	die	role	central	anyone	stupid			wow what a great premise for a film set it around a film maker with writer`s block who decides to take up tango lessons . hey and what an even better idea cast the central role to a film maker who`s interested in tango . gosh i wish i had that knack for genius . yes i`m being sarcastic . it amazes me that these type of zero potential for making money movies are made . come on unless you`re a rabid tango fan i do concede they do exist judging by the comments or a die hard member of the sally potter fan club ? there`s nothing in this film that will make you rush off to the cinema to see it . even if you`re into tango much of the film is taken up with meaningless scenes like a house getting renovated or a man in wheelchair going along a road coming soon the review lesson where a failed screenwriter from scotland sits in front of a computer writing very sarcastic but highly entertaining reviews of films he`s seen . gasp in shock as theo robertson puts the boot into the latest hollywood blockbusters , weep in sympathy as he gets yet another rejection letter from a film company , fall in lust as he takes a bath and rubs soap over his well toned body . the review lesson coming soon to a cinema near you if anyone is stupid enough to fund the movie ps sally potter is unrelated to harry potter

1			part	best	life	entire	audio	awful	movie	worst			this movie was by far the worst movie that i have ever seen in my entire life . i m not even kidding . it was poorly made and the actors couldn not act . it was a waste of my time and money . it looked like a movie that my friends and i could have put together on our own . the case the movie came in is definitely a disguise . nothing in the movie looks like the zombie on the front of the case . it appears that the director or make up artist has just put black eye liner under someones eyes an called them a zombie . the credits at the beginning of the movie take up almost 20 minutes of the movie . which watching the credits was the best part of the movie . this was honestly an awful movie and i couldn not believe how badly it was put together . scenes jumped from one thing to the other and sometimes u were like whats going on ? the audio was awful and the action shots looked like a couple of teen's joking around making a fake fight scene . if you are considering renting or buying this movie i would advise you to at least watch the trailer for it because it show's how awful it truly is . i wish i would have watched it before i rented it .

1			reviews	bad	bulk	big	design	good	it	pointless	family	comical			don not be deceived as i was by the glowing reviews quoted on the dvd box . wildly entertaining . a seriously scary freakout . and the worst of all , on par with jaws . this movie is none of the above . normally i don not bother with writing bad reviews for films but i can not believe this one is resting at a comfortable 7 on imdb . it doesn not deserve it . after a so so opening daylight attack by a monster created by , what else , chemicals dumped by lazy scientists , this movie goes absolutely nowhere and it goes there sloooowly . basically and improbably , a girl is snagged by the monster i will give them points for a good creature design but this ain not no weta creation and her semi comical family spend an hour and a half tracking her the sewers surrounding the han river . their search lacks any suspense again , someone called this on par with jaws ? and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much pointless . other than that , a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop . blech . this was bad . i m not kidding . you want to see a rotten monster movie ? rent deep rising . at least you will save 30 minutes of your life .

1			thing	poor	ones	good	one	good	episodes	poor	episode	hate	i	glad	it	worth	view	strong	issues	political	episode	poor			i originally gave this episode a rating of two i now wish i would thought more about it . i also wish they had negative rating options . watching it , i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish . i adore ron pearlman , and john carpenter . so what went wrong ? last season episode 13 was pulled due to the way it handled the abortion issue . i think that this season mr carpenter managed to make something so grey area that you can not immediately see if he is pro choice or anti abortion . it was only after i sat and thought about it that i realized he is very much anti abortion you get this most clearly in the end when the mother shoots the baby and kills it , to the dismay of the father , who walks off in grief , leaving the mother unharmed . but you also see it in the way the ron character is treated i hardly think that if someone has proved themselves enough of a threat in the past so as to have a restraining order against him that they would not immediately be ringing the police . instead we have the guard almost sympathetically dealing with him only to pay for it in the end i don not mind someone having a strong view on something , even if it isn not something i agree in , but i do think its a bit lame not to stand by that view , rather than trying to look like they are sitting somewhere in the middle . but , political issues aside , this episode was beyond poor . the music was retro -70 s and just plain didn not work . the acting other than ron p . was poor . the effects were dreadful it might have been better just to not show the monster at all rather than show the lame excuse for a monster they had . all this being said , i m glad they have the masters of horror i don not mind sitting through some really poor episodes to find the good ones . its a bit like renting horror movies from the video store every now and again you get a good one and it makes it all worth while . i do agree with the poster that said maybe the name needs to change from masters some of these people just plain don not deserve the title . let me stress tho even tho i hated this episode , john carpenter totally deserves the title . he is a master thru and thru

1			guy	authentic	room	static	cliché	old	companions	incredible	results	flat			tierney's an authentic tough guy , but this movie misfire from normally competent rko undercuts his impact at every turn . the script is about as plausible as oj simpson at a ten cmmandments dinner . just count the times tierney's incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts . the old clich about it only happening in the movies applies here in spades . then there's the guy playing the watchman , who appears to have wandered in from a boozy wc fields comedy , ruining the menacing mood in the process . the static one room sets don not help either , and neither does director feist's obvious lack of feel for the material . then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay off , and the results are pretty flat . in fact the movie only picks up in the station house scenes where hard bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent looking gas station attendants . too bad that tieney's career never really gelled . i gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another . his ice cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of lee marvin at his tough guy be st anyway this project might have worked as a radio play , but as a movie with a promising noir title , it's a disappointment .
1			i	impressed no	story	original	version	soft	intentions	original			i was willing to go with the original cruel intentions . it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories . however , this movie was , in my opinion , a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices . i didn not honestly care what happened to any of them . the strongest part of the original story les liasons , not ci is the characters and their interactions , not the events themselves . i wasn not clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel , especially since the title includes a number 2 i expected a sequel , but then determined that it must be a companion piece . over all , i must say that this movie read , to me at least , like a soft porn version of les liasons . i was not impressed .

1			quality	low	it	stupid	ideas	original	thing	single	acting	bad	thing	positive	example	good	writers	good			this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood . the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business . the idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot i rented the film is discouraging also . obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenager's family because he wants her . for no reason he kills the mother , father and brother . from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction . years later , obsessed teacher breaks out of prison . hmm usual bad writing no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute . obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around , sniff out people and with a knife is super killer . sure ! ! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason , knifes bellhop for the fun of it , and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends . now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you . obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel again it is stupid , ever cop would know his face but he walks right by them . now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend . there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage . if any other profession put out work of this low quality , they would be fired . yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash .

asks brennan . up on the pelly river . trouble with the chilkats , someone replies . he's got a real tough job , that constable . he patrols some ten or twenty thousand square miles . sometimes he don not get home for two or three months at a time . the historical truth is that the yukon territory during the gold rush was the closest thing to a police state british north america has ever seen . the northwest mounted police was stationed in the territory in considerable numbers long before the klondike strike . they controlled every route into the yukon and they brooked no nonsense . they collected customs duties , often over the wails of the new arrivals , made arbitrary laws on the spot about river navigation , and turned men back if they didn not have enough supplies , or if they simply looked bad . in true canadian fashion , they laid down moral laws for the community . in dawson the lord's day act was strictly observed ; it was a crime punishable by a fine to cut your wood on sunday ; and plump young women were arrested for what the stern faced police called giving a risqu performance in the theatre , generally nothing more than dancing suggestively on the stage in overly revealing tights . in such a community , a gunbelt was unthinkable . one notorious bad man from tombstone who tried to pack a weapon on his hip was personally disarmed by a young constable , who had just ejected him from a saloon for the heinous crime of talking too loudly . the bad man left like a lamb but protested when the policeman , upon discovering he was carrying a gun told him to hand it over . no man has yet taken a gun away from me , said the american . well , i m taking it , the constable said mildly and did so , without further resistance . so many revolvers were confiscated in dawson that they were auctioned off by the police for as little as a dollar and purchased as souvenirs to keep on the mantelpiece . in 1898 the big year of the stampede , there wasn not a serious crime let alone a murder in dawson . the contrast with skagway on the american side , which was a lawless town run by soapy smith , the denver confidence man , was remarkable . but in the far country dawson is seen as a community without any law , which a soapy smith character from skagway he is called gannon in the picture can easily control . in real life , one of smith's men who tried to cross the border had all his equipment confiscated and was frogmarched right back again by a mounted police sergeant . {in the movie the lone mountie says} yes i m the law . i represent the law in the yukon territory . about fifty thousand square miles of it . then why aren not there more of you ? because yesterday this was a wilderness . we didn not expect you to pour in by the thousands . now that you are here , we will protect you . when ? there will be a post established here in dawson early in may . what happens between now and may ? you going to be here to keep order ? part of the time . what about the rest of the time ? pick yourselves a good man . swear him in . have him act as marshal the movie mountie leaves and does not appear again in the picture . his astonishing suggestion that an american town marshal , complete with tin star , be sworn in by a group of townspeople living under british jurisprudence is accepted . naturally they want to make jimmy stewart the marshal ; he clearly fits the part . but stewart is playing the role of the loner who looks after number one and so another man is elected to get shot . and he does . others get shot . even walter brennan gets shot . stewart finally comes to the reluctant conclusion that he must end all the shooting with some shooting of his own . he pins on the tin star and he and the bully , gannon , blast away at each other in the inevitable western climax . to anybody with a passing knowledge of the canadian north , this bald re telling of the story passes rational belief . excerpt from hollywood's canada , by pierre berton , 1975
1			film	available	actors	capable	screenplay	terrible	film	pathetic	research	little	mystery	little	i	surprised	movie	incoherent			i saw this film when it was first released . the memory of how bad it was has stayed with me almost forty years . i didn not want to trust my own sentiments about the movie when i saw it , so i consulted a movie review published in a major metropolitan newspaper the next day sentiment confirmed , the reviewer wrote that the movie was incoherent , indecipherable , and uninspiring . a little research reveals that the producer was star leslie caron's husband , thus the whiff of nepotism suggests the beginning for this awful film . the film's roster of many capable actors caron , warren oates , scatman crothers , gloria grahame , and james sikking among others suggests that it holds some promise . but the death of this film is attributable to its terrible screenplay . the mystery implicated is so obscure and so little revealed throughout the film that the viewer is left perplexed from scene to scene . the movie seems torn between being a detective mystery and an espionage thriller , but never settles upon one or the other . the sense of suspense is entirely absent . the main characters settle on playing dry , emotionless types in a fashion that inspires no empathy whatsoever . the cinematography is pedestrian . the result is that the hapless viewer loses interest in the characters , the plot , and , in the end , the film itself . i am little surprised that there is no version of this pathetic film available to purchase . i hope that if tcm finds a print of this film and feels compelled to air it that it is safely relegated to the 4 00 am slot .

1			message	great	man	great	it	insulting	cripple	pathetic	it	sound	disabilities	physical	disability	physical	person	real no			i just watched this movie in high definition on television . i am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities . at first i found the main character somewhat noble and captivating . his message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great . and my problem isn not with the real person who did these things . he was a great man . but this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching , that i found it insulting . first of all , they didn not cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability . sure they were competent actors , but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film . further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches , appearing to have only one leg . but the cgi in this scene is so apparent it is shameful . what ? they couldn not find an actual amputee anywhere for the film ? for a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do cgi effects than to just hire an actual amputee ? at that point in the film i found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that i came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple i am . figure that out .

1			waste	complete	clarity	total	kind	pretentious	noirs	british	lines	different	viewing	great	story	complex	clear	great			contrary to most other comments about syriana on the imdb web site , i and my family found watching this film on dvd at home a complete waste of time and space . in short , this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far . rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner , it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30 second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so story lines at the audience made for great and clear viewing . no , sir , it does not . what does make for great viewing is total clarity , precision , plots and story lines and characterisations which have a beginning , a middle , and an end . this kind of cinematic presentation akin to the dim sum experience in a chinese restaurant is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme . thank goodness , then , for the tv and dvd presentations of the hollywood and british film noirs of the 1940 and 1950 whose writers , director , and actors knew the value of clear story telling , diction , and acting that meant something . this is one dvd that this family will not be sitting through again .

1			it	hard	man	old	editing	good	video	good	sound	good	cinematography	good	everything	good	sets	good	costumes	good	value	incredible no	sense	worst	show	least			unfortunately i have to agree with the critic written by halopes . for a short film the cinematography , costumes , sets , sound , editing and everything else is very , very good . this might seem surprising at first but i was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals , so the quality is to be expected . the problem , as usual , resides in the story itself . thing is , it's not really a story . to tell a story or in cinema's case , show a story you need plot and conflict . you need things that happen to the protagonist events . these events happen because the protagonist wants something and , for some reason , he can not get it . tim watcher has no problems or goals . he's a kind of supernatural entity who observes mankind . that's it . so what we have here is pure exposition . instead of being shown a story , we are simply learning things about this tim watcher individual . of course , considering the peculiar nature of tim watcher and the film's short duration , it's hard to give enough background about him so the movie resorts to voice over narration . in this case it's used in the worst possible sense which is to give information that otherwise we would never glean . in fact , if it wasn not for the vo we would think the character was just a kooky old man going around looking at things . to make it worse the vo also explains what's happening on the screen ! the images we are shown are just decoration for the text we are listening to . i could say that this short film would make a good video for a band or something , but because the images don not stand on their own it's impossible to say that . what's left obviously has value as a measure of the crew's technical capabilities not incredible , but good but fails to entertain , amuse , thrill or , at the very least , show a story .
1			rest	bad	me	sick	thing	best	card	big	thunderbirds	original			the most embarrassing moment in this film is when brady corbet says you have blossomed , near the end the film . i practically died . i m still not really sure why the screenwriters put that line in there . was it supposed to create romance ? because it nearly made me sick . the rest of the script was almost as bad . i have never liked the original thunderbirds , but a thunderbirds movie had the potential to do so much . this movie doesn not . if it didn not have the big draw card of the thunderbirds brand , it would have been shafted straight to tv , or canned in the post production . maybe even before . like i said , the best thing about the movie is when the credits roll up and they play busted's song not hunderbirds are go . i can not believe i wasted $ 7 watching this through pay per view .

1			queen	recognizable	photos	famous	work	memorable	richards	stunning	richards	good			this documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of betty page's paige richards career . the tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin up queen in history . her most memorable work came in the 1950 s and was fetish photos , bondage and cat fight girly flicks . irving klaw dukey flyswatter at his movie star news instructed betty on what to do in front of the camera . there was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films , but nonetheless , klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution . it is no surprise that betty had a cult following at the height of her career . the girl next door with jet black hair , blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades . after all , it has been said that she was photographed more than marilyn monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world , elvis presley . betty page would disappear and devote her last years to religion . this movie actually could have been a lot better ; but good enough to hold intere st miss richards is stunning in her own right . bra , panties , garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the lea st also in the cast jaimie henkin , jana strain , emily marilyn and julie simone . be advised this movie can change your heart rate .

1			budget	low	commandos	great	army	entire			i own almost every seagal movie yes even ones like this that are low budget , and i must say , this may be the worst , not only of his movies , but of all movies ever made . the only highlight of this film , and only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is that it is seagal , and seagal does have some sweet action sequences , specifically in the store , and also when ever else he takes out an entire army with a knife . next time give me 90 minutes of seagal killing people , and don not even bother with a story line , because the storyline not only stunk , but so did the acting , the fact that f -18 s and f -14 s somehow changed into f -16 , and also the fact that the stealth was as fast as an f -16 also the stealth never had to refuel ? ? and since when is afghanistan considered hostile territory from an air force stand point . last i checked , afghanistan has no air force , we usa control the skies . also , this top secret mission was played through speakers to all the crew in the room , yet the admiral still whispers to the other guy that it is secret . also , how did seagal go from the bottom of the truck , to the top ? please tell us why they jailed him , since when are air force pilots great commandos unless they are owen wilson ? and since when are their drunks in arab countries , considering muslims don not drink alcohol ? also on top of that , since when do arabs listen to orders from females like the 2 in charge ? the highlight of the film was definitely seagal killing people in the store , and the other 50 people he killed with a knife , as well as the very brief and totally random lesbian scene that came out of nowhere .

1			drop	single	kid	youngest	tools	various	lady	old	music	ridiculous			believe it or not , the woodchipper massacre gave me full blown gonorrhea ! that's right , i have got a rainbow of discharge spewing from me just because a group of kids went playing around with a camcorder and somehow made a deal with the devil and got distribution . it's beyond my comprehension how anyone with moderate intelligence could tolerate this pant load of a film . the only reason i managed to sit through the whole thing not without several suicide attempts along the way was because , well first off , i was delirious with boredom , and second i guess i wanted to further explore this newly discovered type of hate i was experiencing . this movie is a 'shot on video horror / comedy about three siblings who are left for the weekend in the care of their bitchy elderly aunt . the youngest kid ends up stabbing the old lady accidentally with his rambo replica hunting knife . they then get to dismembering auntie with various tools apparently she didn not have a single drop of blood in her body ! and heave her into their dad's rented wood chipper . her convict son then stops by looking for his mom and the kids end up grinding that jackass too . i don not recall ever seeing a cast of annoying actors that actually caused me nausea . seriously , that one blond chick's voice had me wincing in pain constantly . all of the actors were downright atrocious literally just screaming their phony sounding dialog and cracking jokes that must have been written by a chimp that just didn not care ! now , i can usually appreciate independent efforts , but only from those who can realize that people other than their relatives might be watching this ! i don not need to see a 3 minute shot of a car pulling out of a drive way and a torturous , painfully long lawn grooming montage with some ridiculous , fluttery music playing over it . plus , why the hell does the box of this movie have a bloody piano on it ? there was a piano in one scene and no one is killed near it ! i m through with reminiscing about this movie . unless you like insufferable crap , i would advise anyone with half a brain to avoid this trash .
1			i	disappointed			everyone involved and the audience should seek out the candidate to see how good this movie could have been . what happened the south american story ? what were julie christie and kate capshaw thinking to allow their roles to be cardboard cut outs . up to now i have liked every gene hackman performance and / or movie . he was either disinterested which i can hardly believe or dreadfully misca st i have also liked and defended richard gere and been vilified for it . but here he had no power . he was never intimidating and only occasionally persuasive . all in all i was very disappointed . i really expected much more from this director and ca st if you can not find the candidate watch wag the dog again or even bulworth .
1			limitations	visible	cityscapes	big	literature	classical	direction	low	key	low	brandauer	unique			franco rossi's 1985 six hour italian mini series of quo vadis is a very curious beast , creating an absolutely convincing ancient roman world shot in matter of fact fashion very few long shots , no big cityscapes , but playing the drama down so much in favour of allusions to classical literature and history that the story constantly gets lost in the background . the shifting structure much of episode one is played out via voice over letters and lack of narrative urgency makes the full six hour version simultaneously demanding and undemanding , and certainly far too often uninvolving , but it has something going for it . the two main strengths are the characterisation of petronius a thankfully dubbed frederic forrest , whose own voice would almost certainly flatten his dialogue as a man whose spent so long looking for an astute angle to survive court life that he's become incapable of experiencing emotion , and klaus maria brandauer's unique take on nero as a wannabe actor whose every move and action is calculated on how his audience will receive it . elsewhere , max von sydow briefly appears in a few episodes , being rewarded with the show's most impressive and genuinely moving scene here he encounters a child as he attempts to leave rome . it's the kind of thing the show could do with more of , but it seems all too often to flatten every potentially emotional , inspiring or exciting moment under it's relentlessly low key direction . unfortunately francesco quinn makes a staggeringly anonymous hero , blending in with the walls and coming over less as a roman officer than that quiet , slightly gormless but inoffensive guy who works in the same office as you who never says much at office parties you know , the one who you think is called dave or something like that . the budgetary limitations are very visible once its meet the lions time for the christians and ursus battle with the bull is so determinedly low key that it just passes over you before the show just abruptly loses interest and suddenly ends . not a trip i can particularly recommend , i m afraid , but if you do embark on it it's one not entirely without its small rewards .
1			everyone	hate	movie	worst			it's been nearly 30 years , and i still hate everyone involved in this movie . it remains the worst movie i have ever seen . before seeing this , i never much minded rivers , one way or the other . after seeing this movie , i have an allergic reaction when i accidentally see her on television . i got dragged to this against my better judgment by peer pressure . however , coming out of the theater , those friends swore an oath to never again overrule my choice of movie . nearly thirty years later , we still carry around mental scars from this movie . on my deathbed , one of my regrets will be the time i wasted hoping that this movie might get better . it never did . if you are ever given a choice , you would prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie . i registered for imdb comments just in the hope that perhaps i can warn others against viewing this movie . if i can save just one person from watching this , then my existence on this earth will have been justified .
1			movie	classic	chemistry	big	rom	classic	you	disappointed			look , there's nothing spectacularly offensive about this film , it's just boring . it's a typical rom com with an ending you can see coming before you have seen so much as the trailer . the key difference is that the classic rom coms tackle their stories with wit and a lack of pretension . this movie has no pretension but it really has no sense of movement , you feel as though you could get up and walk away at any moment . the production of the movie also has the feel of a debut movie made about fifteen years ago . i would recommend re watching a classic movie like when harry met sally instead of this shallow imitation . oh , one other big chemistry . if you are used to seeing michael looking all cute as vaughn in alias , you are going to be seriously disappointed with the way they have made him look here .
1			movie	original	kind	good	schlock	low	they	fun			if you read my review of syfy's dinoshark , you know that i can appreciate the low budget schlock that these made for television movies can provide . they are are they are still pretty fun in a so bad , it's good kind of way . so , still smacking with guilt for liking and recommending the undeniably hokey dinoshark , i sat down to watch hammerhead shark frenzy , a syfy original movie about a half man , half hammerhead monster terrorizing people on an island . with the syfy channel's sure fire recipe for creating b movie creature features and a cast that includes william forsythe and hunter tylo , how could it possibly go wrong ? well , to my surprise , it actually misses the by much , but enough to make me not recommend it . why ? well , first of all , its titular monster , the dreaded hammerhead human hybrid , takes a backseat to a bunch of faux military thugs who really become the movie's primary villain . though the hammerhead does rack up the body count , he or it or whatever you call the thing only arrives just before someone is going to be munched upon and leaves directly after . the rest of the movie is filler , pitting our heroes against the aforementioned soldiers . that , to me , is just not as compelling as watching a walking hammerhead eat people ! please read the full review on my blog
1			movies	bad	gift	great	movies	worst	scenes	nice	employees	former			this is one of the worst movies ever made . trite . predictable . flat . the only thing that rated one point was there was a few nice scenes highlighting barcelona . i imagine they would use films like this in guantanamo or some other hidden cia / nsa prison to torture suspects . often bad movies have some redeeming features , this has nothing . if i was in it or worked on it , i would change my name . truly a tu rd hard to write more than this , but i feel the world's film watchers needed a head's up on this . on the other hand it will make a great gift for people you can not stand . you could send it to politicians you dislike , in laws , ex wives , teachers you hated , former employees , dick cheney , w . and a host of others .

1			it	poor	you	scared			don not waste your time or money on this one . the half decent cast might fool you into thinking that this teen thriller , whilst hardly about to break any records , might lightly entertain for 80 minutes . it won not . it won not make you scared , laugh , cry or even challenge your intellect . it will leave you wondering how on earth this movie ever finished production . yes , it really is that poor .

1			acting	great	role	bland	solution	terrible	writing	worst	movie	terrible			i found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible . the only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was lacy chabert's performance who i thought played the multiple personalities really well . for me she was definitely the highlight of this movie . dina meyer was pretty as always but i found her role pretty bland so i don not think one can say that her acting was great . as for the male lead , armand assante , his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980 hospital series . all of that i could have lived with . however the terrible , terrible , terrible end / solution , the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing i have seen in a long time .

1			systems	weak	violence	extreme	sentiments	mixed	plot	fantastic	enthusiasts	young	it	gratuitous	performances	good	york	new	something	substantial	hellraiser	original	adaptation	best	hammer	big	concept	promising	elements	good			i heard and read many praising things about midnight meat train , which is based on a short story written by no less than clive barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original hellraiser that he directed himself , but so far i can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience . the most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating ! the violence is sadistic and extreme , which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts , but it's also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative . normally speaking , i m very pro violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose . the butchering literally depicted in midnight meat train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs , and even that isn not fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects . there are more shortcomings , some even bigger than the pointless gore , but perhaps i should focus on the good elements fir st the basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room , for example are literally oozing with nail biting suspense and macabre atmosphere . unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted . presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities , but i honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by vinnie jones . the plot introduces leon , an aspiring photographer in new york whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures . leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train . leon's right , as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer , but the killer's motivations and behavior suggest there's something far more substantial going on the rails at night . midnight meat train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs , plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood , but director ryhei kitamura versus , godzilla final wars doesn not take full advantage of it all . the ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and , even if clive barker meant to have like this , i still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale . midnight meat train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film , but not without defaults . it's not intended for easily offended viewers , but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well .

1			movie	different	things	good	performance	good	scenery	beautiful	movie	annoying			i have two good things to say about this film the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction . however , that said , i found this film extremely tiresome . watching paint dry would have been more entertaining . it seemed much longer than 97 minutes . beginning with opening sequence , where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone , the movie is annoying . the film is filled with clichs and shtick , not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk . also , the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears . there are some sequences that are touching , but they are all played for laughs . if schmaltzy , sentimental , and cute appeal to you , you will love it . but if you were hoping for something with more substance , see a different movie .
1			taste	horrible	show	good	it	funny	show	original	children	young	movie	horrible			if you ever watched the dukes of hazard you know that you never had to worry about drugs or cussing or crude behavior being seen by young children . if you have seen the movie you know that is no longer the case ! this movie was horrible ! main characters doing drugs and thinking it is funny and cool is certainly not what i call entertainment . they took a wonderful show and just turned it into trash . daisy who was a little flirtatious in the original show now looks and acts like she belongs on the street corner getting paid for her services . i was so excited about seeing this movie before it came out , 15 minutes into the movie i was ready to leave . i stayed thinking it had to get better but instead it got worse by the minute . i wish i had never seen this movie . it trashed a good show and left nothing but horrible taste in my mouth when i left . do yourself a favor , go see something worth your money , cause it's not only a waste of money but a waste of 2 hours of your life you will never get back !
1			challenges	pathetic	it	brilliant	summary	fine	elements	cultural	challenges	silly	idea	glorious	elements	stereotypical	task	fine			if there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste . the fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse . the basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine , but wheres the experiment ? all i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don not know or want to know about . the challenges are pathetic and silly . the whole point of reality tv is to show reality . if you set a challenge don not make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games . make them do an actual challenge . and as for earning prize money , thats fine , if they actually earnt it ! these people are nuts . if only they would make the show better , the actual idea would be glorious . but that ain not gonna happen !
1			character	single	dedication	obsessive	antagonist	biggest	mine	real			this movie was craptacular . i was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was , in fact , myself . i played it beautifully throughout ; promising myself i would walk away , but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way . even in this state , i couldn not help but notice that cuba's acting was as flimsy as tracing paper . his obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards . burt came on the screen as a general , that's right , a general who wears too much makeup . i fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival cuba's , except mine was real and i stubbed my toe . recompense ! recompense my stubbed toe !
1			man	rich	wellington	real	plot	original			this movie is a re write of the 1978 warren beatty movie , heaven can wait , but it is written for the stand up comedic style of mr rock . the premise remains the same lance barton , rock is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with god's representative , mr king , to come back to earth as someone else . as in beatty's movie ; he chooses the murdered charles wellington , a rich white man , all because he fancies sontee jenkins regina king who happens to turn up at wellington's house during the murder . the role of mrs wellington and her lover suffers in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo sontee simply does not work . also the intercuts used to show rock as wellington and then as the real white wellington , fail miserably . improvements could have been made to the original beatty plot which in itself did not masterfully portray the life after death idea but they certainly were not to be found in down to earth .
1			accent	laughable	matter	serious	seemed	real	acting	atrocious	accent	southern			if there was a zero rating , i would give it to this movie . today was the second time i tried to watch it and i still couldn not make it through from beginning to end . i can not believe the multiple stars given by others & can only assume they either know the actors or are a publicist in disguise ! the acting is atrocious all around , the script is blah , the kid playing nichole shows zero emotion even when she's being threatened . the southern accent from the actress playing amber's mom is laughable i m from georgia and have friends from texas believe me nobody talks like that ! none of her emotions seemed real in any scene . the subject matter is very serious and deserves much better treatment .
1			script	awful	seem	hearted	acting	good	film	terrible	direction	good	seem	bored	atmosphere	bad	adaptation	awful	job	poor			this movie proves that good acting comes from good direction and this does not happen in ask the du st colin farrell is usually a fine actor but in this he is juvenile . donald sutherland comes across as an amateur . why ? because the script is awful , the adaptation is awful and the actors seem bored and half hearted . the atmosphere of the movie is bad i could only think when it would finish and i turned it off half way . the director has done a very poor job and even though i have not read the novel it is certainly a missed chance . the atmosphere this film is trying to evoke and the message and storyline never reaches the audience . in one word , it is a terrible film .
1			it	nasty	violence	domestic	none	sympathetic	comments	positive	it	cheap	he	capable	father	alcoholic			i don not understand the positive comments made about this film . it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made . cartoon characters abound sue's foul mouthed , alcoholic , layabout , irish father being a prime example . none of the characters are remotely sympathetic except , briefly , for sue's asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence ! as desperately unattractive as they both are , i have no idea why either rita and / or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob but given that they do , why should i be expected to care what happens to them ? so many reviews keep carping on about how realistic it is . if that is true , it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film . i didn not like the film at all .
1			we	stupid	movie	stupid			me , my boyfriend , and our friend watched this movie if thats what u wanna call it , and we agree with the last person , but we were stupid and bought the damn thing , we thought it really was about diablo so we bought it . we hate it really suxz ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! so beware do not buy this thing they call a movie ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! we would return it , but don not no if anybody would want this stupid movie . oh and another thing , the shouldn not call it the legend of diablo they should of called it legend of azar . and this movie is rated r ? ? ? this should not of even been not rated . we think that diablo would be crying his eyes out laughing at this stupid movie . this is a movie that would have been done by a church . theses actors are never gonna become nothing because this movie .
1			job	nice	feel	sorry	fight	silly	singleton	important	he	smart	guy	bad	jerks	local	message	dual	issues	serious			singleton has some serious issues he has to come to grips with . i get the feeling that he thinks he is pretty smart ; however , this movie is almost comically transparent and self righteous . in addition , there are a bunch of might makes right messages like when our local nazi jerks get beat up . i mean , who in their right mind is going to root for a bunch of nazi jerks ? however , he way singleton portrays the fight is downright silly and seems to be designed to show us more the superior fighting qualities of the black protagonists than anything else . there is another bad guy in reality a drunken frat boy who rapes one of the movie's protagonists . in this instance , i think that singleton actually does a nice job portraying what is probably an all too common situation when the woman involved asks the frat boy to use a condom and he either does not have one or does not want to use one . in any event , he does not accede to her demands that he stop and he proceeds to have intercourse despite her pleas . i think that this type of rape is all too common and in fact many uniformed people refuse to accept the fact that it is even a rape . well , no means no , this is a rape , which probably occurs a lot in universities across the country . having established the rape , how does singleton deal with it ? when the frat boy tries to call the woman , her roommate refuses to put the victim on the phone , at which point the frat boy calls the roommate a black bitch . the aggrieved roommate appears to appeal to a counsel of ice cube , et al , who then proceed to physically humiliate and abuse the frat boy into repeated and prolonged apologies to roommate for his racist remarks ; however the apparently in singleton's mind lesser crime of rape is not mentioned . again , no one really should feel sorry for the frat boy ; however , singleton seems to be sending a dual message that a racist comment is a greater offense then rape and in any event violence is justified against jerks . what is so ultimately so disappointing is that this movie could have truly been about something important but singleton , while no doubt a talented director , does not appear to have the maturity or depth to pull of something of this magnitude .
1			editing	bad	classic	real	acting	worst	images	scary	acting	bad	sooooo	bad	gore	real	films	worst			am i wrong , or is the 2007 version just a rip off of the original ? i have to ask because the dvd i just bought is one of the worst films i have ever acting , bad editing only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap . it is nothing more than a light weight porn real gore , no scary images , just a cheaply done bit of garbage . if anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actors , some slimy gore and a decent baby done on a cheap budget but well an actual story too ! i spit was a waste of money but i will keep it just for a is pathetic ! new 3 . i will keep this film forever just because it it sooooo bad it's almost a really bad worst acting ever . a real crap movie classic !
1			i	surprised			i went to see this movie with my 17 y . o . daughter . i insisted we go the matine showing , not because i m a tightwad , but just feeling i had . in the nascar spirit , this is a sponser's dream . so much blatant advertising , it almost qualifies as an info mercial , if it weren not for the so called acting . keeping with tradition , the herbie franchise continues with its cheesy story lines , the car is only a have hicle no pun intended for this cornball of a motion picture . earlier herbie installments although cheesy as well were produced during more serious times , making them a little easier to dige st ms lohan , disney's reigning drama queen , has little acting ability . i was surprised that mr keaton and mr dillon would get involved in such a project . only the snack bar , was a bigger ripoff !
1			movie	illogical	waste	complete	movie	meaningless			some people might consider this movie a piece of artwork to be able to express your imagination on film in order to create a movie filled with antagonizing pain and death . i personally think that this movie is a disgust , which should have never been released . this movie is repulsive , illogical and meaningless . not only is it a complete waste of time but it makes you sick for days to come . the appalling images shown in the film not only make you grasp for air but they set in your mind and it takes days to forget them . such a shame that people waste their imagination on such inhumane suffering . kill bill would be another example but at least kill bill has its purpose , meaning , climax and resolution .
1			part	best	remastering	true	dialogue	hilarious	sums	best	guys	good	three	old	i	bored	tour	magical	stump	dead	crap	good	dialogue	bad	it	worth	film	worthless	crap	crap	music	bad			i got this in the dvd 10 pack curse of the dead . you gotta love those bargain packs . for even if they don not feature true remastering , restoration and all that hoo ha , and the films are generally in full frame pan and scan format , there's no denying that there are always a few gems included . and by gems , i mean there's always some good crap to be seen , especially if the films are from the 70 as the mansion of madness is . my copy is called mansion of madness , but when the title screens roll it's poe's dr tarr's torture dungeon . doesn not matter , really , as crap is crap is crap , no ? yes ! but saying this film is completely worthless is not true at all . there are some funky elements here and there , and obviously the flick did have a decent budget . the opening title sequence is cool with its colored negative run through a cheap tv look . the dialogue is always hilarious . near the beginning of the film , the horse and buggy driver gets out to move a dead tree stump in the middle of the road . what strength ! says our hero . funny , then , that this dude should later not be able to fight off the wacky woodsmen when they come to make freaky fun . you will completely forget that this guy was even in the movie until he crops up again later near the end . that's how memorable these characters are . the best part about mansion of madness , however , has to be the wacky music and screwball hijinks that the good guys have to endure . it's like bad cartoon music that a three year old would find enjoyable . and why all the weirdo slapstick , anyway ? i would say my fave moment had to be when the horse and buggy is ambushed by the forest freaks when they pull a stupid looking homemade ghost up by a stick in the middle of the road and make the buggy stop . what the hell ? oh yeah , there's plenty of boobies to be seen , too , for those of you that dig such things . boobies , bad dialogue , and wacky music . that best sums of mansion of madness for me . it's well worth at least one viewing , and may be a lot better if you have had a few to drink or whatnot . i can not say i was ever bored watching it , but i can not deny that it's also a barrel of poop . kinda like magical mystery tour but with a plot , but not . hmm . and mr chicken pwnz .
1			sound	terrible	effects	special	actors	ridiculous			nightmare weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had , if you can imagine that . there is no decipherable plot or story , the special effects are a joke , and even the sound is terrible . this film was directed by henry sala . it was the only film that he ever directed , and the reason is obvious .

1			thing	good	ladies	grand	movie	suck	ladies	old			this movie sucks big time . it reminded me of the movie resurrection christopher lambert , which i also found extremely boring . and semana santa is in every way an even poorer movie . only fine one in the cast doing something for this movie is alida valli . alida is one of the grand old ladies in european movie history . i loved her maniacal looks in suspiria and inferno dario argento . i will not spend more time dealing with this movie . i will say another good thing about this it if you want to fall asleep very quickly .
1			it	classic	value	artistic	actress	attractive no			a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like debbie does dallas . nowhere close . i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever . even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time . but i read somewhere that back in those days , porn had to have some artistic value . i was unable to find it though . see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream , or can appreciate art in porn movies . i know i am not . but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person . he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs . of course , they rejected .
1			it	suck	they	dead no	commentary	social	premise	interesting	characters	central	monotony	unbearable			this movie is one of those i regret having invested 90 minutes of my life that i will never get back in . the premise is really interesting essentially it's a zombie flick from the perspective of the undead let's not split hairs as to whether they are actually dead or not} . unfortunately , they fail to deliver a compelling story within this framework . the nearly unbearable monotony of the lives of the central characters may add to the realism of the film , but it sucks all the entertainment value right out of it . if they had put a little more effort toward keeping the viewer engaged , it would have been much more likely that they drive home the social commentary .
1			it	terrible			i had never heard of this adam sandler movie until i saw it on the wall at blockbuster . being an adam sandler fan at the time , i rented it . honestly i could only watch about 30 mins . of it . it was terrible . do whatever it takes to keep this out of the hands of the public . i honestly hope this movie goes oop soon , and i hope it stays that way !
1			passages	literal no	classes	religious			that's pretty ridiculous , i hope many people are exposed to muslims who live all over the u . s , u . k , and all over the world . the religion has over a billion followers . i myself born and bread in america and through my religious classes and teachings i have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society . i am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world . i have know many muslims from all over and i have traveled to countries like pakistan . i have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media . i wonder why . also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion . its a religion of one billion people , and these are less than one percent , i am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the kkk , ira and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge , personal , or business matters through their so called religion
1			movie	good	porn	soft	end	reminiscent	end	predictable	core	soft	looks	promising	guy	old	it	fun			this movie proves that you can not judge a movie by the awesome artwork on the dvd cover . it also goes to show that you should learn more about a movie before you buy it or get it for someone at christmas . the beginning of this movie actually looks somewhat promising . well , until you meet the characters . pumpkin jack the old guy from down the street brings the college co eds a book full of witch's spells that he leaves at their annual haunted house where the movie takes place . after that there is some drinking , fighting , and soft core porn . then the action of the movie finally takes place after over an hour . overall , hallow's end was predictable , unsuspensful , and reminiscent of a soft core porn . this movie is probably best viewed with a group of friends who have nothing better to do , as it is a good movie to make fun of . and for first time viewers , it is really fun making predictions of the order of people who die .
1			i	glad	plot	thin			since i had loved the inspector gadget cartoon in the 80 s , i went to see this movie . i wasted my money . the plot was very thin . also , the movie could not keep me interested for long . i was glad it was over . if you want to see inspector gadget , watch the cartoon instead . it was much better than the movie .
1			backing	british	looked	interesting	nothing	new	group	international	muslims	good	claims	false	serbs	nasty	serbs	bad			this is an anti serb propaganda film made for tv . the muslims are good ; the orthodox christian serbs are bad . that's the message . using entertainment to get across a propaganda message is nothing new . this movie lays it on thick . and apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up . i know better . the serbs , under general draza milhalovitch and his chetniks , saved over 500 shot down us fliers from the germans in world war ii . churchill decided to betray milhalovitch and put british backing behind communist tito . roosevelt followed suit and as a result , after the war ended yugoslavia was delivered over to communist tito . and us ally milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since . this movie is part of the anti serb propaganda campaign engineered by george soros and his international crisis group icg which culminated in the kosovo war , in which serbia was bombed by nato because of totally false claims by the icg of mass graves in kosovo filled with victims of the nasty serbs . the fact that there were no such mass graves and the albanians muslims had no business being in serbia's kosovo are facts that most of the media won not print . i chose this movie to watch because the one sentence description on the video cover looked interesting . imagine my disgust when i discovered i had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at serbia . instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the clinton administration to come clean with the congress and with the american people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from iran to the muslim government in sarajevo . i won not hold my breath waiting for such a movie .

1			beck	wooden	way	hard			the movie that shoots scenes of a scenic caverns tour . remember no one from this movie except for michael pataki who dished out extreme pain as jc in five the hard way . he's the really annoying sheriff who i did applaud when he practices nightstick on our rabid doctor . probably the most laughs you will have is with dr beck's epileptic seizures out of nowhere . could mrs beck be anymore wooden ? seriously , if you took a 4 foot branch , stuck it in a hot tub , you wouldn not be able to notice a difference . the dread and suspense is looking over at the clock wondering when the credits will roll . watch it as a late night movie , mstified , but don not go out of your way .
1			bank	predictable	it	different	film	contemporary	ending	conventional	violence	gratuitous	discrimination	racial	them	fun	cocktail	hideous	issues	social	sista	good	angle	racial	structure	feeble	manipulation	preposterous	issues	serious	stereotypes	nasty			after a lively if predictable opening bank heist scene , 'set it off plummets straight into the gutter and continues to sink . this is a movie that deals in nasty , threadbare stereotypes instead of characters , preposterous manipulation instead of coherent plotting , and a hideous cocktail of cloying sentimentality and gratuitous violence instead of thought , wit or feeling . in short , it's no different from 90 of hollywood product . but it's the racial angle that makes 'set it off a particularly saddening example of contemporary film making . posing as a celebration of 'sistahood , the film is actually a celebration of the most virulent forms of denigrating afican american gangsta stereotype . the gimmick this time is that the gangstas are wearing drag . not only does the film suggest that gangsterism is a default identity for all african americans strapped for cash or feeling a bit hassled by the man , it presents its sistas as shallow materialists who prize money and bling above all else . worse , 'set it off exploits the theme of racial discrimination and disadvantage simply as a device to prop up its feeble plot structure . serious race related social issues are wheeled on in contrived and opportunistic fashion in order to justify armed robbery , then they are ditched as soon as the film has to produce the inevitably conventional ending in which crime is punished , the lapd turns out to be a bunch of caring , guilt ridden liberals tell that to rodney king , and aspirational good sista , jada pinkett smith , follows the path of upward mobility out of the hood and into a world of middle class self indulgence opened up for her by her buppie bank manager boyfriend . 'set it off illustrates the abysmal state of the contemporary blaxploitation film , pandering to mindless gangsta stereotypes and pretending to celebrate life in the hood while all the time despising it . while the likes of 'shaft and 'superfly in the 1970 might have peddled stereotypes and rehashed well worn plots , they had a freshness , an energy and an innocence that struck a chord with audiences of all races and still makes them fun to watch . 'set it off wouldn not be worth getting angry over if wasn not a symptom of the tragic decline and ghettoisation of african american film making since the promising breakthrough days of the early 1990 .
1			lack	complete	entries	previous	rehash	weak	opinion	personal	rubbish	total			to the small minority seen here praising this film get serious . i know it's down to peoples personal opinion at the end of the day , but anyone with more than a couple of brain cells can surely see that this is total rubbish . so bad it does not deserve to be part of this franchise . i can only assume those saying how great this is are friends with somebody involved in the film and are trying to give their career a push . poor in every way , don not con people by saying otherwise . storyline is a weak rehash of the previous entries , script is likewise . attempts to hide the lack of originality by using a girl instead wow ! don not disguise the film makers lack of ideas , and there is sadly a complete lack of any scares . absolutely no redeeming qualities , utter utter tu rd i have awarded this pair of chancers one mark simply for having had the nous to get someone to fund this piece of crap . they must have put more effort into that than they did into actually making the film . shame .
1			hockey	boring	films	imaginative	i	glad	ground	new	homages	empty	me	cold	wannabe	original no			okay , i have tried and i have tried , but i still don not get this guy maddin thing . tales from the gimli hospital left me cold , that movie about the austrian villagers and the one about the ice nymph were pretty to look but lacking in the story this nudie movie about abortion and hockey is just boring . i m glad maddin has an appreciation for silent film , but i dislike his films for the same reason i dislike the films of quentin tarantino they are empty homages to better , more imaginative films films that advanced the art form or broke new ground and are all style and no substance . no amount of jump cuts and odd camera angles can disguise the fact that maddin is an unoriginal david lynch wannabe , though he does have one advantage over tarantino he generally doesn not write embarrassing dialogue , because most of his films rely on intertitles . the bottom line is , maddin's schtick is clever clever film making for aspiring film majors .
1			effects	horrendous	issue	big	location	different	idea	good no	they	bland	they	dull			professor paul steiner is doing research in matter transference . he has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear , only to have that object re materialize in a different location . but there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesn not succeed . after a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding , professor steiner decides to test his machine on himself . as expected , things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will kill . in hindsight , maybe it wasn not such a good idea to re watch the projected man in the same week i watched the fly , return of the fly , and curse of the fly . there seems to be only so many movies about matter transference and the potentially horrendous effects it can have on the human body that one person should be made to endure in a three or four day period . i m not sure what those responsible for the movie list as their source material for the projected man , but much of it is so similar to the fly movies that it cannot be mere coincidence . however , the projected man isn not even nearly as good as the worst of the fly trilogy . besides being terribly unoriginal , the projected man has several other problems that really hurt the enjoyment of the movie . a big issue i have is with bryant haliday in the lead . he's such a horse's ass that , not only do i not care about his suffering , i actually root for it . supporting cast members mary peach and ronald allen are almost as bad . they are so bland and dull they hardly matter . in fact , there's very little to get excited about while watching the projected man . the soundtrack not very memorable . the look i would describe much of it as muddy . the plot predictable . the action there isn not any . overall , this is one to avoid . fortunately , i watched the projected man via a copy of the mystery science theater 3000 episode . funny stuff ! while not an absolute , very often , the poorer the movie the better the mst 3 riffs . the guys hit almost all of their marks with the projected man . i will give it a very enthusiastic 4 5 on my mst 3 rating scale .
1			core	hard	budget	low	it	bad	vets	former	guy	nice	lou	soft	bar	local	guy	real	movie	great			cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80 s thanks in large part due to the films such as 48 rs . and lethal weapon . this one stars reb brown and lou ferrigno as to former vietnam vets who happen to run a local dive bar . reb takes care of lou because he saved his life in nam . but lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft . although he's huge , lou has the brain of a child . one day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and lou and rebb beat the tar out of them . but payback's a mother . they crash the bar leaving lou and reb with nothing . that is until these two thugs come into the picture one of them's a real nice guy who have a plan in mind . the film's a waste of time . maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked . alas , it doesn not and the audience is left holding the bag . oh well . it's too bad because you have all the elements for a great b movie . better luck next time , i guess . not recommended . xxx

1			title	real	it	interesting	gun	scary	scenes	imaginative no	chuck	old	chase	low			the cover art which features a man holding a scary pellet gun would make it seem as if it's a martial arts film . hardly . i find it interesting that the film's real title is trojan warrior . trojan is a brand of condoms in the us this movie is loaded with homoeroticism . if you like that stuff , then this film isn not that bad really . however , consider these points there are numerous close ups of actors groins & butts , one scene even features every actor with an erection bulging in his pants . the film is also bathed in gaudy colors like lime , peach , and red . from a cinematographer's standpoint , this movie's a drag queen ! several scenes feature characters standing extremely close to one another , occasionally touching as they converse . also , the cousin of the hero likes women , and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him . is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey ? shall i go into the fight scenes ? yes , someone's private parts get grabbed in one fight . the martial arts scenes are brief and unimaginative . no fancy stuff here , just your standard moves you would see in an old chuck norris flick . there's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever low speed chase put on film .
1			wont	disappointed	airplay	disappointed	low	new			this movie defines a new low in bollywood and has set the standard against which all c p must now be compared . first off , the beginning did have elements of if handled well , could have become a cult classic , a la pulp fiction or a desi the plot was there one ? begins to meander and at one point completely loses it . throw in a deranged don with an obsession for english , a call center smart alec , a femme fa tale who can don a bikini and a saree with the same aplomb , a levitating , gravity defying hit man and a cop with a hundred or was it a thousand black cat commandos on their ingredients in competent hands . but this is where i would like to ask the director sir , what were you smoking ? im sure this movie would be remembered in the annals of bollywood film making for what must never be done insult the intelligence of the most brain dead of movie goers . possibly the only redeeming feature in this desi matrix plus desperado plus grindhouse caper is the music . watch the the airplay and you wont be disappointed . vishal shekhar come up with some eminently hummable tunes . how i wish the director had spent the money in creating some more eye candy . as i sign off , i want to really , badly know how does akshay's bullet wound vanish in a were you editors doing ? tashan , maybe .

1			evidence	important	claims	central	documentary	biased	mistake	crucial	arguments	different	it	preposterous	investigation	poor			this documentary film is based on incomplete considerations of the evidence , in which brian flemming , perhaps purposely , fails to mention important evidence to the contrary . perhaps his most crucial mistake is one of the earliest his claims concerning the invalidity of paul's testimony about jesus christ disregard key facts , like the existence of some formulated creeds within paul's letters . these creeds suggest that most of the central claims about jesus were already formulated into statements of faith possibly within a few years of christ's death and resurrection . the testimonies of the early christians can not just be tossed out as mere fantasy . there were indeed many people claiming to be the messiah during that period , but only one of them has remained jesus . why ? because it would have been preposterous for anyone to have actually believed christ was the messiah , and go on to die for those beliefs , if they knew that he had not been resurrected . even if the gospels are dated more liberally , we are still talking about accounts of jesus written within the lifetimes of other eyewitnesses that would have pointed out inaccuracies in these gospels . and there is evidence that the gospels were written much earlier . what i am saying is that flemming's documentary is an incredibly biased and self serving piece of work that hodge podges different arguments and evidence to serve his anti christian view . don not be fooled by poor investigation .

1			thriller	nice	bits	long	it	hard	things	good	endings	worst	editing	terrible			i saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema . i had some hopes for the movie because i really like spoorloos the vanishing and the book it's based on . the movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller . quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines , characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for like marjoke and terrible editing . the movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long , a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just don not add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped . after suffering through the story you will get treated to one of the worst endings i have seen in a very long . it should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which you are probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies . it's hard to mention any good things about this movie . about a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and i didn not hear a kind word after the movie was over . avoid this movie at all costs . it really destroyed any faith i had left in the dutch movie industry .
1			judo	single	plot	unbelievable	movie	direct	use	pathetic	actors	secondary	ton	wrong			i can not believe that steven segal's career has hit so low that he has been reduced to making 4 h rate films with 5 h rate secondary actors . i watched this moving expecting to see him beet the crap out of some people the way he usually does . when he is reduced to using a single judo chop between the shoulder blades to take out an opponent and the guy falls like a ton of bricks something is wrong . the plot is unbelievable as a movie , and even if you excuse the visuals , and had read this story as a novel , you would be left wondering why you had even picked up the book . steven segal goes through the motions and seems as if he is only doing this because he is under obligation . he shows no effort and no enthusiasm , and in some scenes he doesn not show up at all . i hate to repeat other peoples comments , but the use of stock footage for cut scenes and for visuals of the aircrafts in flight is pathetic . the condition of those scenes chopped in , is shaky and scenes themselves seemed to have deteriorated over time . the zappruder film showing president john f kennedy being assassinated is steadier and cleaner . my honest opinion is to tell you not to waste your time seeing this movie , it is not up to the standards of his work in the glimmer man or exit wounds . i read one review that said the movie had a 12 million dollar budget segal being paid 5 of that and that the movie still came in under budget . i must concur . it is no wonder that this is a direct to dvd movie , as no conscientious theatre owner would play this movie .

1			it	fine	state	emotional	guys	bad	explosion	grateful	absence	complete	endeavour	artistic	guy	good			the explosion of tv channels must be eternally grateful to the randolph scott western production line , because any any moment there must be one of what seems like a hundred randolph scott movies playing on at least one no budget station . man behind the gun is a typical early 1950 s period melodrama with pre wwii production values that relies on a historically topical murder mystery plot peppered with action scenes to disguise the script's complete absence of character development , and thus lack of suspense . in years to come the role of these films would be taken over by tv shows like gunsmoke , bonanza , etc and these actually did the job better . randolph scott , looking particularly grizzled in this , is the good guy , struggling against the bad guys against whom he will eventually prevail . there's no more interest in what he goes through emotionally than in what his horse is feeling , unless you count wondering whether he will sort out the initial misunderstanding with the female lead by the end . the music is a stronger indication of the emotional state of the characters than the acting is . but it's fine if that floats your boat ; and i wouldn not berate you for enjoying would iagnosis , murder , either . workmanlike , pedestrian , and ageing rapidly . 3 stars for being competently put together ; 0 for artistic endeavour .
1			dialogue	bad	actors	new	vacation	weakest	plot	central			european vacation aka national lampoon's european vacation is the weakest of the vacation films the first and third one the most superior of the films . while chevy chase and beverly d angelo return as clark and ellen griswold with new actors in the roles of russ and audrey griswold , this time they are given a weaker script with very bad dialogue . this causes the pacing to suffer , with the jokes not very funny at all . to be more specific , what really causes this film to suffer is the fact that the jokes as they are , are just pasted together into a cobbled together script , rather than serving a central plot as the other 3 vacation films have . oh well , they can not win them all . 4 out of 10

1			movie	original	minutes	outrageous	some	original	minutes	original	sequences	new	sequences	nice			. mainly because ju on 2 boasts an outrageous forty minutes worth of material literally taken straight out of the first ju on and when you consider that the sequel only runs for 76 minutes , that leaves you with 36 original minutes worth of film . ho hum . i found that deeply irritating as if viewers simply wouldn not remember the same stuff ! not to mention dull , having to watch it all over again . ok , that complaint aside , the byline for ju on 2 was that it was supposed to explain a lot of the unanswered questions from the first movie , which frankly , over 36 minutes , simply doesn not go far enough to making any kind of sense of the original's highly convoluted storyline . there are , however , some really nice new horror sequences which show how good the film might have been , had it had some time to develop ; and some of the questions raised by the original some , but not all are answered . so in conclusion if you loved the first original movie and want to see some further developments on the story , go for it but just remember to keep your remote control to hand with your finger on the fast forward button for forty minutes .

1			lion	big	fellows	convincing	performance	memorable	thing	good	murder	political	movie	awful	one	old	script	terrible	passing	moving	servant	little	lion	young	party	political			the movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl , the other an upper class political party . the crossing point is the public relation character played by al paccino , as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening . if the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama , the performance of al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as the godfather as here as a little servant see also donnie brasco . actually , the big young lion has become a tired old one . this passing of ages is very moving , because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too . but his slowness is only a make up because he can get back his energy in church scene . maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on al's talent !
1			drugs	bad	movies	worst	students	good	movie	bad			what to say about this movie . well it is about a bunch of good students who have some bad drugs and turn into delinquent students that sell more of the bad drugs to people . two of those people have adverse effects as one turns into a toxic avenger type and his girlfriend throws up some creature that grows in the school's basement . that is about all there is to it and they stretch it out for 84 minutes . this movie is pretty bad and should be locked away forever . though that is not fair , some people like troma's movies and they can watch it if they want . troma movies for me though , are the worst movies there are out there . i just watched this one out of morbid curiosity .
1			i	harsh	folks	important	me	wrong	creatures	fictitious	movies	direct	acting	atrocious	wasn	good no	story	lame	story	weak	point	original	flick	little	movie	bad	movie	worst no			may contain spoilers a few weeks after i had originally wrote my review for hood of the living dead i realized that i may have been a bit too harsh on this movie . which is why i decided i would do something i had never done before . review the same movie again . don not get me wrong , i still don not like the movie , i still think it's dreck , and i still think the zombies don not look all that zombie ish . the story in the movie is still in my opinion , weak and rather lame . the story is about a guy named rick , who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells , in animals and his brother germaine , the two aren not exactly on the best of terms my my , an original plot point and argue a lot . one day germaine is shot in a drive by shooting , and rick calls up his scientist buddy to bring the serum to try to resuscitate germaine whereas most people would have called 911 but whatever , naturally the serum fails and germaine dies if that didn not happen there would have been no movie , after the police and the coroner until the end of time i will still think that maybe the paramedics should have shown up leave the scene shows the coroner van which i still believe was just someone's van with a coroner decal thrown on the side , and germaine returning to life to attack and kill the paramedics . i would talk more about the plot , but i feel that if i reveal more about the story you wouldn not want to watch it and we wouldn not want that now would we ? but suffice to say that the story in my opinion at least meanders and is rather slow moving pun not intended . as i have previously said in my review the zombies don not look all that much like zombies , i still think they look like they have been in a bar fight . that's not to say that they should all be decaying and whatnot , but still there should at least be bite marks on the victi ms also i still don not like the fact that the director s continually switch up the pace at which the zombies move . they couldn not really seem to decide on whether or not to have the zombies run or shamble as most zombie movies do , don not get me wrong , i m all for running zombies but make up your minds people . in one scene the zombie runs toward the living , and in the other he just shambles to them . and sometimes they just don not seem believable yes i know their fictitious creatures but still , i am of course referring to the zombie that runs his hand on the wall as though he were walking through a dark living room , and i still don not like the zombie who is lying on the ground , gets shot , then jerks like he was just shot . the sound in the movie also bothered me , mainly the music , which while it may have just been my copy of the film seemed pretty much non existent . music in a movie is important folks . especially when the sound editing does sound like the director just took a friends camcorder and shot a little zombie flick . the acting is still atrocious in my opinion and is on par with the american actors from the japanese zombie movie junk . the movie is still bad , almost house of the dead bad , it's better , no doubt about that , but then again that's not saying much . it's not the worst movie out there , and it is better than a lot of direct to video movies that are out there but at the end of the day wasn not good . i also think the movie moves really really slow , despite the fact that it is only an hour and twenty or so minutes and yes , i still don not like the opening song . this is the type of movie i think is well suited to be premiered on the sci fi network . which is why i am obligated to give this debacle of a film a one out of ten . but think of it this way , at least it's not a negative one .
1			film	direct	screenplay	elementary	acting	terrible			who ? what ? where ? when ? why ? the acting was terrible . very robotic , rehearsed . i have seen all of the actors in this film in better roles . the screenplay was very elementary . by the end of this film , the story line was tied up . and jeane claude lamarre should be tied up , too . so that he never attempts to write / direct another film .

1			choice	bad	word	ordinary	price	little	premise	ridiculous	i	embarrassed			the only word i can think of to describe this movie is ordinary . the plot line about gary sinise's character attempting suicide is a ridiculous premise and c mon . living as some sort salingeristic hermit or recluse in a shack driving golf balls into the ocean because he couldn not handle life in the lucrative pro / am golf community ? cry me a river . i wish these were my proble ms i do enjoy dylan baker and sinise but this movie was clearly a bad choice or a pay check for sinise . the scene in which little timmy price gets verbally abused by the other club member in front of his father during the tournament is so over the top that i am embarrassed to watch it
1			it	good	production	new	reports	true	point	important	way	safe			we all knew even before it aired , the ron moore mini series is no battlestar galactica . that's fine . it just means it must stand on its own . it can not lean on battlestar galactica . if it's any good , it's good on it's own merits , and ron moore has something to be proud of . if reports are true , this is what moore wanted . however , if his mini series rots , he has shamed all the excellent actors that performed on screen , not to mention the myriad off screen personnel . and this is what he's done . yes , this mini series is no remake . i wouldn not even call it a re imagining . it's a new production , inspired by battlestar galactica . it does not take place in the galactica universe , with the same places and jargon and technology . it doesn not tell of the galactica's search for the thirteenth tribe . nor does it rely on the legends and mysteries that underpinned galactica . ron moore's mini series is a space opera , action flick with a ceremonial nod to battlestar galactica . maybe i should say , just another space opera , action flick . because as plots go , his has little that's original , or even interesting . i could relay the whole thing to you without a spoiler warning . but i won not inflict that on you . i will just hit the most important point . ready now ? here it is just watch the trailer . it will tell you everything there is in the story . yes , creations of man turn on man and seek to destroy man . i guess they forgot azimov's rules , again . they look like humans , so there's the whole aliens among us thing . at least there's no time travel . oh , and lots of fighting scenes and random acts of sex and violence . the end result was that when moore did draw from galactica , that ceremonial nod , it came off more corny than respectful . i mean , couldn not he even think up anything of his own ? from the first few minutes , i wanted to watch something else . i didn not care about any of moore's characters , since i couldn not identify with any of them . this fact hit me in the face when the cylons began their attack . armageddon on a planetary scale , and i didn not give a damn . how depressing . moore's heroes when faced with an insurmountable obstacle , instead of overcoming it , rather tucked tail and saved their own butts . after all , it was the only way to save humanity , yadda yadda yadda . they took the safe way out , rather than risking their own lives to defend others . at least disgust is not apathy . but in the end , the ron moore mini series was just activity without purpose , a movie on a treadmill , forever running yet going nowhere . and i just wanted it to be over . and by the time it was over , my life force had been sucked from me . against my own will , i was turning into a mindless , soulless zombie , probably of the type to which this mini series would appeal . i needed to replenish myself . i needed to and i swear this is true i needed to watch an episode of babylon 5 two episodes , in fact , and i felt much better . and happier .

1			it	humorous	gore	decent	they	alive	turn	wrong	they	dead	girls	big			yes , definitely better than my viewing of death tunnel . actually some of the deaths were pretty original and the gore was decent . it was kind of like wrong turn meets the hills have eyes . but 1 when the kids high school or college ? are discussing horror movies in the kitchen , everything shae says is almost an exact quote from scream 1996 . the thing about the big breasted girls etc 2 was steve not a bootleg randy from scream ? 3 besides the fact that it took place in october , what the hell did the movie have to do with samhain ? pretty unnecessary if you ask me . i find it humorous when i see those horror movies from the 80 s that explain away loose ends by pointing the fingers at the druids or a pentagram . 4 wow they made a sam raimi reference ! ! 5 why was gary and his sister in the movie ? they are characters had nothing to do with anything . and hes so psychic that he couldn not even see his own death ? 6 when gary was being killed in the bathroom at that point , the deaths became simply troma licious how could she hear the screams when she was downstairs but not hear them when she was standing outside the door ? 7 gary's sister commented on haggis thats primarily a scottish dish , not irish . 8 so the lesson is if you are like shae and don not have any fun or crack a smile through the whole film , you will be the one to live ? 9 the mutants were pretty cool , but they looked like walking dishes of chili con carne . 10 when they brought in gary's sister , did they forget that steve had been strapped there and wonder where he went ? 11 was there not more than one killer ? shae beat that one , but never encountered any more of them . 12 what was with the flashbacks to those other people ? half of them shae didn not know if they were dead or alive , so what was with that ? 13 why didn not they kill gary and his sister before ? 14 why did no one ever call the police ? and apparently everybody knew those people lived in the woods , why did they never organize some kind of raid ? 15 as far as i know , they were not zombies or vampires so how could she turn into one at the end ? i m with everyone else on the giant huh ? at the end . way better than death tunnel , but still quite sloppy . i still don not understand why they even placed it in ireland , considering samhain had close to nothing to do with the plot .
1			character	single	problem	biggest	detriment	serious			i had the opportunity to preview this film as a member of a test audience , and the only thing which kept me in my seat was the chance to fill out the post screening survey . i felt the film's biggest problem was its lack of a main plot . instead , it was composed of too many sub plots competing for screen time . as a result , there is not a single character who is developed enough for the audience to form any sort of attachment . what the director and producer failed to do was show us why we should care what happens to the characters . in fact any one sub plot and the characters associated with it could have been removed altogether without serious detriment to the film . the time gained would have allowed for the much needed development of the remaining sub plots and characters . simply put , the hungry bachelors club's plate is overcrowded with side dishes and appetizers when an entre is desired .

1			people	eccentric	people	pathetic	people	poor	women	vulnerable	point	low			a low point in human interaction was reached by the maysles brothers with this film . do remember , you who used words like masterpiece when reviewing this film , that these maysles creeps didn not just happen to drive to the hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people . no , when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project . then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women . no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation . these wretched maysles smiled , kissed ass , did whatever they had to to get the beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done . one would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt . but the film making process , given the preplanning , actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the beales as human beings . an exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people . as time accrued their film making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here . their reputation as human beings is execrable . that is what people will remember them as . grotesque hustlers .
1			action	serious	timing	comic	star	real	deveraux	terrible	unisols	new	films	bad	one	bad	manner	intentional no	lines	ridiculous	sense	good	shutdown	automatic	story	new	sequels	direct	jai	professional	points	strong no			the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel . since the real star , dolph lundgren , would not be able to reprise his role from the original , there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write off . bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white . to their credit , they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement . bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film , and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role . for once , his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times , and it does not get irritating . the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his fil ms and therein lies the problem . you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action . you go because you want comedy , however unintentional . unbeknownst to many people , universal soldier was followed by two direct to video sequels . i have only seen the first , which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke . matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career , the sight of jean claude van damme comes as a welcome relief . the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct to video sequels , and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original . after years of investigation and explanation , the unisol project is still going ahead , with some minor modifications . for one , the new unisols are stronger and more damage resistant than their earlier cousins . for another , all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth . in the early parts of the film , seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome . being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes , we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut . the unisol project is on the chopping block , which essentially means that seth will be turned off . seth , somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained , decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down . his only problem is that every so often , a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown . two individuals possess the code in question . seth kills the first in short order , and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be . the rest of the film revolves around the unisols attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly . a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film , but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting . the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichs . when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white , we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over . he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness es . gee , seth , you mean they will not be our strong points ? all kidding aside , the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength . it leaves the action without adequate setup . in the original , we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols , how they work , and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film . here , the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate . at least in the original , a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice . here , one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform and presumably his body , getting up every time without stopping for breath . i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner . if you can see it on the cheap , knock yourself out . this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre .
1			point	lowest	york	new	it	awful	movie	unwatchable	i	disappointed	days	bad	movie	worst	movie	terrible			dolph lundgren stars as a templar who comes to new york when a key that unlocks the anti christ is found by an archaeologist , of course the demon is only a couple miles behind dolph and isn not killed so easily as he transfers from body to body . like fallen without the suspense of course lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable . i admit to being a fan of dolph lundgren , like steven seagal and jean claude van damme , i try to watch his movies whenever they are on tv . i caught the minion and boy was i ever disappointed . this movie is utterly terrible . with action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena . worst of all is lundgren's woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest ! all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of fallen which was good and end of days which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie i have seen from dolph lundgren . it literally has nothing to recommend it . it's awful and it's the lowest point in lundgren's career . and i saw cover up , the last warrior and masters of the universe . 1 2 out of 4 awful

1			issues	sensitive	area	northern	gut	real	ending	happy			if i had not read pat barker's union street before seeing this film , i would have liked it . unfortuntately this is not the case . it is actually my kind of film , it is well made , and in no way do i want to say otherwise , but as an adaptation , it fails from every angle . the harrowing novel about the reality of living in a northern england working class area grabbed hold of my heartstrings and refused to let go for weeks after i had finished . i was put through tears , repulsion , shock , anger , sympathy and misery when reading about the women of union street . excellent . a novel that at times i felt i could not read any more of , but i novel i simply couldn not put down . depressing yes , but utterly gripping . the film . oh dear . hollywood took barker's truth and reality , and showered a layer of sweet icing sugar over the top of it . a beautiful film , an inspiring soundtrack , excellent performances , a tale of hope and an adaptation of union street the women of union street and their stories are condensed into fonda's character , their stories are touched on , but many are discarded . i accept that some of barker's tales are sensitive issues and are too horrific for mass viewing , and that a film with around 7 leading protagonists just isn not practical , but the content is not my main issue . the essence and the real gut of the novel is lost darkness and rain , broken windows covered with cardboard , and the graphically described stench of poverty is replaced with sunshine , pretty houses , and a twinkling william's score . if you enjoyed the film for its positivity and hope in the face of are ality , i advise that you hesitate to read the book without first preparing yourself for something more like 'schindler's list without the happy ending .
1			movie	good	doubts	serious	woman	young	smile	constant	actress	great no			this film should have never been made . honestly , i must admit that before i saw it i had some serious doubts . the director is not a great actress , though she did a lot of movies in holland , and the young woman who took the main part is a tv personality with a constant smile on the face and not much self criticism . the actor who played the other main part i recently saw in bride flight and although that film is better , he did not convince me than . to start with the the story , i have not read the novel it is based upon , but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids having a birthday party on a rainy sunday afternoon , not someone of the same age as the director who likes to watch a good movie . something really disturbing were the overdubbed dialogues , it was most of the time spoken out loud . my regards go to the cameraman , at least he tried to make something out of it . it is a pity that the film is edited lousy , if not , some scenes were certainly more credible .
1			movie	despicable	nature	aggressive	effort	despicable			this was a cute movie until the ending . the ending was merely one more despicable effort to emasculate men and empower women at their expense . the girl refused to listen to reason and logic and used her passive / aggressive nature to control and impose her will on the guy who ultimately yielded his power and control over the relationship to her . it is not by chance that she was sitting behind the driver's wheel in the car as they drove away at the end after he had to beg her and plead with her to take him back . this movie is a victory for all women who think they should be in charge of all men and in control of their relationships with them . it was a despicable movie for that reason .

1			types	different	effects	mysterious	experiments	real	mechanics	real			as a physics student , i have become aware of many idiot professors , and other so called experts , in the field . as i continue with my studies , i learn more and more about real physics experiments going on , and about the people who are doing things right . then , my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see . knowing nothing of it , i m excited , hoping that the information will be presented well . i have done real quantum mechanics ; this wasn not it . this movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can , and will , occur to you , if you just open your eyes . let's think about that , for just a moment . our bodies are composed of somewhere around 10 30 such subatomic particles . that is a million billion billion billion particles ! the more mysterious quantum effects of just two particles can have a 50 probability of cancelling each other out completely . as you add more and more particles into the mix , it becomes almost impossible to have a large net quantum result . to tell us to believe that this is a valid assumption , with no rationality behind 's just stupid . my friend , also in physics , and i counted 3 facts during the course of this movie . but they were presented in the most misleading manner i have ever seen . i cannot say as much for the neural portion of the movie , as i have not had any kind of medical training . it seemed as though it might have had a slight bit more truth to it , remembering my days in biology , but i cannot say . at least this film had a redeeming quality the dancing peptides or whatever they actually were scene . not to ruin the invaluable plot that drives this movie , but the main character goes to a wedding , where she sees all different types of personalities driven by their peptides , and then the film cuts to the dance floor , where we are spliced between people dancing , sometimes surrounded by cg peptides , and a fully cg scene , filled with dancing peptides . the film , at that point , was trying to tell us how we are addicted to emotions , so we are treated to the full song of that smash hit , addicted to love . this scene was redeeming , because anyone who could go through that scene , and still take this movie , you are the ones that need to open your eyes .
1			minds	creative	anyone	wise	children	elementary			can i do it not ill i need glasses ? at the very least proves the point that anyone can make a movie . talent is not a consideration . the folks who unleashed this wretched pile of spewing vomit upon the world , lack any semblance of talent , taste or intelligence . the target audience must consist of the recently labotimized , and infants who play with their own feces . anyone else would be far too world wise to get even a snicker out of this film . it consists of a series of sophmoric skits in which the punchline does not even extend to the obvious . it ends at the ludicrous . the jokes told are the types of jokes that elementary school children tell usually potty or sexually related where they don not know the meaning of all of the terms they use . you know , like the one about daddy's car and mommy's garage . to apply any sterner method of criticism would be pointless , since the usual standards of acting , writing , direction and such have never even been heard of by the creative minds . behind this mess . not to be judgemental , but anyone who enjoyed this film should seriously reflect upon their purpose on this earth .
1			pile	big	evidence	real			this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any real evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example bart sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn not there be two or more shadows for each object when apollo 11 went through the van allan radiation belts they spent 30 min's there not the 90 min's claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray . seriously do some research learn what really happened don not let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened

1			action	little	thunder	constant	scenario	little	introductions	good			this tv made thriller is all talk , little action . it works hard to set up its convoluted plot , yet the writing is so muddled the exposition is still cloudy at be st by the end , i knew no more about these characters than i did at the beginning . it has a quasi ten little indians scenario , but ditches it mid way through in favor of spotlighting sally field and her uncovering of a killer . field overacts here with a gracelessness i have seldom seen from her . the early introductions are good , but the writing quickly strays off course and eventually goes over the top . lots of hysteria , and constant thunder and lightning effects which adds nothing . a curious failure from producers aaron spelling & leonard goldberg . with all this talent , couldn not they give us something more than a script full of red herrings and sally field hiding in a closet ?

1			songs	musical	newmar	naked	charm	little	guys	stupid	it	long			the rookie suffers from so much . there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie , the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush . noonan and leavitt just don not know when to quit . it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked . then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day . it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid , stereotyped japanese guys . but , it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters . then it just abruptly ends . even a naked julie newmar in a towel can not save this one . there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long . the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing . stick to martin & lewis . at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face .

1			guy	lamest	movie	funny	women	attractive	dialogue	terrible	guy	bad			this movie is actually worse than most movies i have ever suffered through , and i have suffered through a lot . absolute nonsense . it's got terrible , forced dialogue ; pointless plot developments ; really drawn out 'spooky imagery scenes , which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie ; 5 10 at best attractive women ; long , boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about virgins ! especially ones with lop sided fake breasts ; muttered , difficult to understand speech from some of the characters ; and they actually used the masks from killer klowns from outer space during a masturbation scene , which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny , but it isn not . veden fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film . absolutely give this one a miss .
1			acting	good	movie	worst			this is absolutely the worst movie i have seen all year . first , i will say that the acting was very good , and by all of the ca st this was apparently meant to be very offbeat , and in that regard it succeeded . by the same token , the story revolves around a self centered wannabe , who is a clueless , talentless chronic liar , whose source of self confidence comes from a pair of leather slippers . this was worse than watching a car wreck .
1			comedy	good	cast	good	direction	good	task	different	people	annoying	wit	direct			oh dear . good cast , but to write and direct is an art and to write wit and direct wit is a bit of a task . even doing good comedy you have to get the timing and moment right . im not putting it all down there were parts where i laughed loud but that was at very few times . the main focus to me was on the fast free flowing dialogue , that made some people in the film annoying . it may sound great while reading the script in your head but getting that out and to the camera is a different task . and the hand held camera work does give energy to few parts of the film . overall direction was good but the script was not all that to me , but i m sure you was reading the script in your head it would sound good . sorry .

1			it	awful			i tried to finish this film three times , but it's god awful . case in point mom and daughter drive up to the bed and breakfast , mom stops for gas , crazy gas station weirdos mad at her hubby whose running the b&b try to rape her . she escapes , heads to b&b and instead of hubby going ballistic and she wanting to call the cops , story just continues with lukewarm behavior on both their parts . wow . other action logic deficits abound . acting is also lukewarm , and the next door neighbor's warning is delivered in a really corny , badly acted moment . moments of intense gore / death unevenly interwoven with lukewarm scenes of time filler interplay between characters . less focus on gore , more focus on mood and story would have been appreciated .
1			bill	good no			as a fan of the sookie stackhouse books , i find this series to be a totally crass representation of them . vampire bill is not very good looking and looks much older than described in the book . i found that they have made already wonderfully colourful characters seem very course and vulgar . one of the things i loved about the books is that despite all the crap that she is going through sookie is always a lady , and yet in the tv series she doesn not seem like that at all . not only that but the prejudices displayed in the tv series are not nearly as wide spread in the books . i didn not expect an exact replica of the books but i at least expected the feel of them to be used for the series .
1			movie	bad			i didn not know it was possible to release a movie this bad . the labeling sounded so promising , but you would think that with a cast of 20 at least one of them would be able to act . my wife left me and went to bed after the first 20 minutes . she made a wise decision .
1			ray	young	trophy	creative	it	good	line	best			i haven not been able to decide if this movie is so bad it's good , or , to quote enid coleslaw , so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again . no matter , it forced me look much the same way a pile of weird coloured vomit might , and it offers up a number of scenes that you won not forget even if you want to . there's a sneering young ray liotta telling a pigtailed pia that her creative writing trophy looks like a penis . a bit later , there's ray again , molesting pia , not with the appropriately shaped trophy but a garden hose . there's a firm chinned pia telling her domineering mom that she wants to go to bed with ray's geezer father , walter . there's the actress in the graveyard scene yowling the best line ever written by pia or anyone else wwwwhhhyyyyyyy ! there's that garden hose again , as walter waves it pia's face and roars is this more to your liking ! there's pia and her date so turned on by closeups of each other masticating salad that they start tearing each other's clothes off . there's pia showering but forgetting to remove her dress . perhaps best of all , there's pia's typewriter , but instead of keys there are the miniature talking heads of those who have tormented her the most afterwards , i was afraid to open my laptop . and finally there's pia at the awards exposing hollywood for the cesspool it is , spitting out the second best line ever , i guess i m not the only one who has ever had to her way to the top . i see i have already spent more time commenting on the lonely lady than i have on far better pictures , so i will quit . be forewarned , though , that once you start watching you probably won not be able to take your eyes off the screen until two hours of your life have vanished forever .

1			it	easy no			saw in on tv late last night . yeah , i can hear what y all say about this one . it is likely to be categorized as one of those stereo typical tv soap series . in all fairness , the story line does have a fine twist to it , and you might nod saying , well , that's not what i expected . but , as a film , well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element . casting , acting , camera work , cars , costume , setting , script , no , there's nothing to congratulate . rated r ? oh , that scene . did we need it ? this is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched . and what was the title again ?
1			direction	weak	taste	bad			evil aliens owes a huge debt to peter jacksons early films bad taste and braindead . i must confess to never enjoying those films particularly and i say the same about west is a director who clearly lacks inspiration of his own and chooses to steal from those whom he looks up to . i lost count of the amount of times a major hollywood film was quoted most notably james camerons amount of blood and gore on show here isn not funny either , the latter end of the film becomes tired and dragged out . maybe it would have worked better as a short actors a poor , the direction is weak and the plot is non existent . i can see what the director was trying to do , the homage he was trying to pay , but others have done the same thing a lot better than presented here . 4 10
1			matrix	low	soundtrack	great	weirdo	graphic			decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things . i also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff . if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the ad police then this might up your street . but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style . great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge / punk / post grunge bands . worth checking out if only for the soundtrack .
1			life	personal	film	great			no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer . after all , very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take , and that was pretty much sinatra's modus operandi on set . i feel that as the 1960 s wore on , the quality of the man's films really started to tank . the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin's matt helm series which came out at the same time . perhaps even a james bond competition , but nothing really worked for frank during these years . his personal life in shambles , his music fading out . sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950 s . the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan's express in 1965
1			performance	great	movies	real	use	poor	look	stupid	edge	real			hubert selby jr gave us the book requiem for a dream and co wrote the screenplay to aronofsky's movie of it . that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate , and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them . last exit to brooklyn still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives , but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did . the film seems laughably anti gay at times . especially when in the film homosexuality equals death . one gay character gets stoned , is launched skyward by a speeding car , and lands dead on the pavement . another is crucified and still more are simply beat up . another exaggerated piece of shock value , that might actually have been compelling if it were done well , are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike breakers . who would have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions ? the director , uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director , but he is far below the cut for real movies . the film is clunky that can not even seem to settle on a genre . lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part . and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead , a loathsome hooker named tralala believe it or not , i m not joking . her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the lea st poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is , and also takes the real edge off the more provocative bits . a failure .
1			shame	real	accent	unbearable	fanfare	little	actor	worst	film	fun	it	bad no	tripplehorn	poor	wasn	disappointed no	lovers	bad	affair	entire	actress	greatest	day	best	dialogue	romantic			i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an art house theatre , no less ! but couldn not make it there in the one whole week it played , but yesterday i finally saw it on cable wasn not disappointed , that's for sure ! madonna has done it again yet another bomb ! when will this woman learn ? when will the studios learn ? or perhaps they already have , since this film was largely dumped , with little fanfare and deadly word of mouth . one would hope that being directed by her talented husband , who's created some interesting and / or terribly entertaining work , would bring out the same quality madonna showed in desperately seeking susan ; alas , it just isn not meant to be , for here she is , at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness , the smugness permeating every frame she's in , made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux british accent , an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant . this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman , and look at her films of , say , the past decade like a latter day bette davis , there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body , which here , despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace , are done no favors . to her credit , the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess . no one involved escapes unharmed bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on screen , though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good , which had me thinking all the while , denial ain not just a river in egypt ! adriano giannini , son of giancarlo giannini , star of the italian original , swept away . is , like his father before him , immensely attractive , and isn not altogether bad despite winning a razzie nomination for worst actor , but , like almost everything else about this production , it all comes back to madonna , on whose shoulders rest the blame . why her ? why not her husband , director guy ritchie ? just who do you think was behind this remake ? what actress wouldn not want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her , with only a relative nobody sharing the screen ? oh sure , ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone anyone ! should have , and could have , taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn not get splinters , or at least display a semblance of she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole . above and beyond anything else , this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it . a film like this , an odd couple ish , war of the classes , should be light and fun , with leads who can bounce off one another with witty , even romantic , dialogue , for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded , really be ? honestly , i don not think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for ; it succeeds neither as comedy i defy you to laugh even once or romance madonna's ice princess routine precludes any chemistry . it's not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy . a real shame .
1			it	flat	doo	good	it	awful	episodes	old	outings	direct	jokes	contrived	something	good	voices	original	jokes	lame	changes	hate	aspect	worst	animation	hate			i am 17 and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes . i love the 1990 movies , and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade , scooby doo and the goblin king , which i wasn not expecting to be as good as it was . anyway , back to get a clue ! i watched some episodes , expecting something very good , but from what i saw of it , i wasn not impressed at all . first of all , i hated the animation . it was flat , deflated and very saturday morning cartoon standard , easily the worst aspect of the series . even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation . even worse , shaggy and scooby looked like aliens , and i really missed fred , velma and daphne , as they added a lot to the old episodes , when scooby doo was positively good . i also hated the character changes , because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries , shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero , something they would have never had done in the movies or in the scooby doo where are you ? show . the theme tune wasn not very good either , i can not even remember it , and the jokes were lame and contrived . though , i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast , had they had better material , and hadn not been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible , which they did , might i add . in conclusion , i personally thought it was awful , and i am not trying to discredit it , it's what i personally feel . 1 10 bethany cox
1			atmosphere	nonexistent	invasions	entertaining	end	worst	it	bad	it	dull	element	special	action	nonexistent	film	worst	disasters	natural	heroes	worst			spoilers wow , end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience . here is the full story a scientist is getting messages from space a la independence day . the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china . he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages and who's also sending out messages in space . he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent . they visit it . everything looks normal , including the priest played by a bored christopher lee . but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent . so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens , disguised as priests and nuns . they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet . once the alien get the special element , the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform . lee , being the last alien left , tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens . lee walks in the transporter and he's gone . the couple , looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world , decide to follow the aliens . because earth is doomed , the couple doesn not see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear . the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding . the end . that's it . i have never seen such a dull movie in my life . it's the most underwhelming movie i have ever experienced . the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen . they don not care about anything . they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide what the heck , who needs earth anyway ? they don not even try to stop them or do something to make things better . this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent . the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces , so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work . i wasn not expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production , but i didn not expect it to be this bad . christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions . well , i m sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun . starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining . end of the world is much , much , much worst it's beyond dull and inert , with no entertainment value whatsoever .

1			killer	original no	she	poor	form	current	movie	dead	sound	poor	sections	difficult	plot	relevant			with the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget , truly independent horror film . make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective , the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor . the major problem with frightworld is it's length , at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie , plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant . in places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour . however when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch . this could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some judicious and ruthless editing , in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut .

1			germans	contemporary	headedness	wrong	it	ridiculous	standards	low	quality	cheap			having seen triumph of the will , i can only say this movie is ghastly , even measured against the historically low standards of the time . naturally it's all totally fabricated and prejudicial . this is what one would expect of 1930 s german propaganda . unfortunately , the quality of the presentation , itself , is hackneyed and cheap . it's also so blatantly ridiculous that even contemporary germans must have left the theater holding their noses . in a genre renowned for its base appeal , lack of originality and unapologetic wrong headedness , this film doesn not even qualify as bad . it would have to improve significantly to attain that status !

1			it	good	drifter	mysterious	scenes	ludicrous	torso	naked	movie	bad	thriller	romantic			this movie is so bad it's good in an unintentionally funny way . i couldn not stop watching it , i was laughing so much ! it's like a parody of a romantic thriller , except it's not a parody . alexandra paul plays emily wendell , an oppressed preacher's wife who falls hard for luke corey sevier , a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison ; the only thing sevier is guilty of , though , is bad acting ! mind you , he's no worse than the other actors . you get the sense that the actors have no idea they are in a really awful film ; they are playing it straight . everything about the film is bad the acting , the script , the love scenes , the pacing , the plot twists , the choice of music . the climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church , then luke's final words to emily i was howling with laughter . evidently luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison , and we get to see plenty of his naked torso . that's probably the highlight of the film .

1			mess	theatrical	scene	ludicrous	goers	ethnic	stevie	poor	blacks	professional			i m not sure why spike lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor stevie wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess . i also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional blacks . the abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame . scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes , play as if some college kid wrote this . i especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up snipes . the overacting of the leads makes one feel as if spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about . the final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in . this movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the f word in casual conversation . i am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker . i think his union with scorcesee in clockers was a wise move . he should stick to making documentaries like the four little colored girls . shock movies do not an oscar make .
1			forms	different	it	bad	it	awful	movie	bad			don not even bother with this movie , it's bad when judged on it's own merits , but when compared to the 1972 original which is a classic it's down right awful . and btw , somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book . this is silly , movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from . they are 2 completely different art forms as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does . if you used this criteria for all movies then 2001 would suck and so would forest gump and silence of the lambs .
1			destruction	total	dark	least	elements	stupid	movie	boring			end of the world is an uneventful movie , which is odd since it is supposed to be about the total destruction of the earth . the main character is some kind of scientist , i m not exactly sure what kind . he has two jobs at a government ? facility guarded by four security men . his first job is monitoring transmissions to and from space although this actually seems more like a hobby he does when not working on job 2 . job 2 requires him to put on a protective suit and go into a dark least that's the best i can figure . apparently the plant is not exactly top secret , as the scientist brings his wife there . she hangs out they are on their way to a dinner while he discovers a message from space major earth disruption , repeated over and over . he says something about it being the first message from space he's ever been able to decipher ; his wife tells him they are going to be late for the dinner party . so they leave and go to the party ! ! moments later he finds out that china has suffered a major earthquake . from there , the movie goes . nowhere ! yes , christopher lee is in it , but that really doesn not help much . besides , lee gives a lackluster performance along the lines of his appearance in howling ii . this movie is boring , but it has enough stupid elements that you might want to suffer through it once if you like christopher lee or z grade sci fi . plus , there's lots of stock footage of the earth being destroyed .
1			star	real	jones	famous	them	dimensional			a movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself , blue juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and cornwall . sean pertwee is the real star of this film , while the more famous catherine zeta jones plays his girlfriend and ewan mcgregor plays his drug addicted pal . for those who don not like surfing or cornwall in the slightest , you will find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting . the beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes . plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional . the plot is an interesting idea but because of the shallow characters you have no idea why they act in the situations they are put in . only ewan , sean and catherine's characters make this a film worth being on videotape , which is why it was only released on videotape in the us after ewan and catherine reached mainstream fame .

1			it	little	effects	special			this movie starts out very very slow , but when the action finally gets started , it's a little had to follow . i couldn not understand why some of the events were taking place , and a lot of events happened before they were explained , making them sort of confusing . the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood / gore it has , although most times the special effects are lacking . blood looks like red kool aid . skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks . again , the story has a sort of amateur feel to it , like the writer didn not take a long time to perfect it . i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script . i honestly wish i hadn not watched it , not because of the gore , but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life . if you like extremely gory movies , this is for you , if not , stay away .
1			movie	religious	browbeating	heavy	guys	good	guys	bad	acting	horrible	city	new	simulations	fake	browbeating	religious			this movie which was released directly on video should carry a warning label that it is dangerous to human health and may subject the viewer to terminal boredom . it is yet another thinly veiled , evangalizing rapture religious movie with the good guys the believers suddenly vanishing and the bad guys the non believers left behind . it's an interesting concept , especially since we see it happen on a flight captained by a non believer who is having a sinful affair with a stewardess aboard needless to say that sinner doesn not disappear either ! unhappily , with all the pilots being non believers , the plane did not crash or the movie would have been mercifully over . though this could have be interesting without the heavy religious browbeating , as a whole the plodding movie makes one gag , the acting is horrible and the obviously computer generated simulations are very fake looking . plus it's yet another movie shot in canada that purports to be new york city . spare me . i will just read the bible .

1			points	good	movie	good	day	modern	simpson	good	she	naked	piece	horrible	points	bad			for this review , a list of good points and bad points . i will start with the bad . bad points the casting choices especially burt reynolds as boss hogg , the acting of said badly chosen cast , the storyline , the idea of setting the film in the modern day , the direction , the editing , the soundtrack , and above all , the whole idea of making a feature film out of a television series that wasn not that great to start with , despite it's popularity . good points jessica simpson in a red 's it ! one might make an analogy the scene where jessica simpson as daisy duke struts her way up to michael weston as enos , and asks the question , enos , where's boss hogg and roscoe ? in his clouded judgment , tells her where they might just as well have asked , enos , is this a good movie ? the red bikini would have clouded his judgment into saying yes , even though in his right mind he would have said , no , not really . as good as she looked in the bikini , she could have been stark naked , and even that would not have saved this horrible piece of out of hazzard !
1			damage	psychological	it	bad	thriller	psychological	films	worst	it	horrific			this is one of the worst films i have ever seen ! it is bad , even at tv movie level standards . the plot is diabolically flawed , and the known names in this film are wasted on confused , uncertain characters . i don not know how the director managed to keep this excuse of a film together it is that bad . billed as a psychological horror thriller it is certainly horrific . there is nothing thrilling about it . and it could do you psychological damage ! the initial opening scenes held such promise a possible embarkation on whether the soul is just an aspect of the brain , but the utter shambles that followed the car crash scene is beyond belief . no matter how hard you try , you couldn not care less about the characters . there are so many sprinkled ideas that the film is at best a collage of disconnected phrases from chinese philosophers , and at worst the film would actually make you go brain dead ! i have purchased over 300 films on dvd , and this is the first one i m going to get my money back on . steer clear .

1			storytelling	solid	waste	total no	debut	directorial	directors	new	channel	classic	score	weak	faces	famous	characters	flat	shots	necessary no	problem	biggest	debut	big	storytelling	good	squeaks	artificial	wannabe	classic	score	musical	characters	likeable	cassidy	reminiscent	characters	underdeveloped	classics	previous	shots	wide			proof why hollywood conventions are in place . stale dialogue , underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe . an attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of arthur penn 's bonnie and clyde 1967 and george roy hill 's butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar . problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections . the editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically . unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor . stills , black & white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can not transition well or to replace scenes that just didn not work at all and again are reminiscent of butch cassidy and the sundance kid 1969 . overly dramatic pauses between sentences , random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn not needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 s i was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production . the playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score . no sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots , doors , footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60 s through the mid -70 s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads . in my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story . neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters i wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me . we know from penn's and hill's movies who the heroes are . even though they are criminals , we like them and want to see them get away . i could care less who was on the screen in this film . i got the impression that john milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding john dillenger's life from june 1933 to july 1934 his death . to be fair , there are some moments of good solid storytelling , which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits . john milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn not seem to try to copy other filmmakers . dillinger 1973 isn not a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut , but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy .
1			tv	ludicrous	analysis	complex	exposure	northern			the math aspect to this is merely a gimmick to try to set this tv show apart from the millions of other cop shows . the only redeeming aspect to this show is rob morrow , although his career must have been undeservedly waning after northern exposure if he signed up for this schlock . the lame ness of the math aspect to the show is encapsulated in one episode co starring lou diamond phillips which just confirms that this show is the last refuge of the damned . in order to catch a fugitive , the mathematician uses some theory about bubbles . so , he gives this long explanation that , if we have seen the suspect in places a , b and c , then we can use bubble theory to calculate where he might be . he does this all on a chalkboard , or maybe with a stick in the dirt i cant remember . anyway , when you look at the finished product , he basically took three spots , and picked a point right in the middle and said ok , mathematically , here's where we are most likely to find the fugitive . at which point , one other character points out oh , that point also happens to be the cabin where the guy used to live . is that math ? its not even connect the f k g dots ! ! this show reminds me of the math major i used to work with in banking who had a mathematical analysis he could do to support points that every one else had already agreed on through either less complex analysis or basic common sense . it just goes to show when you are a hammer , everything looks like a nail . i can not wait til they stick the numb 3 s team on osama . they will use calculus , call an airstrike in the middle of the mountains , and hit osama and not even scratch the five children he uses as human shields . cuz hey . its all about the numbers . totally ludicrous tv show .

1			emotion	missing	ironies	visual			a never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film . the blonde wig half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self indulgence by its makers . the wong faye half featuring a very playful , if karen carpenter looking , faye wong holds much more appeal . all the ingredients are there , however , the girl meets boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness . character development is uneven . emotion is missing . for music lovers , wong faye's mung jung yun cantonese version of the cranberry's smash hit dreams is used effectively in chungking express . faye wong also recorded a mandarin language version called zhen tuo . both are on cd , although only mung jung yun is found on the official movie soundtrack cd .
1			backing	financial	effects	special	fact	historical	elements	visual	siamese	new	splendor	visual	tv	old	legend	similar	cgi	gratuitous	score	musical	davies	weak	intentions	good			the king maker will doubtless be a success in thailand where the similar but superior not he legend of suriyothai set box office records . the film directed by lek kitaparaporn after a screenplay by sean casey based on historical fact in 1547 siam has some amazingly beautiful visual elements but is disarmed by one of the corniest , pedestrian scripts and story development on film . the event the picture relates is the arrival of the portuguese soldier of fortune fernando de gamma gary stretch whose vengeance for this father's murderer drives him to shipwrecked , captured and thrown into slavery and put on the bloc in ayutthaya in the kingdom of siam where he is purchased by the beautiful maria cindy burbridge with the consent of her father phillipe john rhys davies , a man with a name and a past that are revealed as the story progresses . there is a plot to overthrown the king and fernando and his new siamese sidekick tong dom hetrakul , after some gratuitous cgi enhanced choreographed martial arts silliness , are first rewarded by the king to become his bodyguards , only to be imprisoned together once queen sudachan yoe hassadeevichit reveals her plot to kill the king and son to allow her lover lord chakkraphat oliver pupart to take over the rule of siam . yet of course fernando and tong escape and are condemned to fight each other to save the lives of their families tong's wife and children and fernando's now firm love affair with maria with the expected consequences . the acting with the exception of john rhys davies is so weak that the film occasionally seems as though it were meant to be camp . the predominantly thai cast struggle with the poorly written dialog , making us wish they had used their native thai with subtitles . the musical score by ian livingstone sounds as though exhumed form old tv soap operas . but if it is visual splendor you are after there is plenty of that and that alone makes the movie worth watching . it is a film that has obvious high financial backing for all the special effects and masses of cast and sets and shows its good intentions . it is just the basics that are missing . grady harp
1			director	great	movies	romantic	action	detailed			they had an opportunity to make one of the best romantic tragedy mafia movies ever because they had the actors , the budget , and the story but the great director john huston was too preoccupied trying to mellow out this missed classic . strenuously trying to find black humor as often as possible which diluted the movie very also they were so uncaring with details like sound and detailed action . maybe it was the age of the director who passed away two years later .

1			movie	successful	houses	nice	it	hate	jimmy	young	i	cruel	child	old	seem	obsessed	houses	big	feels	false			i almost made a fool of myself when i was going to start this review by saying this movie reminded me of billy elliot but then i looked up the resume of screenwriter lee hall only to find out that he was the guy who wrote billy elliot so it's mr hall who's making a fool of himself not me am i being a bit cruel on him ? no because lee has something most other aspiring screenwriters from britain don not have he has his foot in the door , he has previously written a successful british movie that won awards and made money at the box office and what does he do next ? he gives the audience more of the same young jimmy spud lives on some kitchen sink estate . he is bullied at school and no one loves him . the only thing keeping him going is that he has aspirations to be a ballet dancer . no actually he has aspirations to be an angel but considering his household he may as well be a ballet dancer . he has a macho waster of a father who thinks ballet dancers are a bunch of poofs while his granddad says ballet dancers are as tough as any man you could meet . i remember seeing the bolshoi ballet . yup ballet is a main talking point on a run down british council estate those days not . come to think of it neither is left wing politics which seems to be the sole preserve of middle class do gooders who live in nice big houses , so right away everything about this set up feels ridiculously false another major criticism is that this is a film that has no clue who it's trying to appeal to . i have often criticised channel 4 for broadcasting movies at totally inappropriate times the land that time forgot at 6 am for example but they showed this at 2 am and for once they have got it spot on . considering the story involves politics , ballet dancing gawd i hate it lung cancer and poverty there's no way this can be deemed suitable for a family audience but since the main protagonist is an 11 year old child and features angels and ballet dancers don not blame me if i seem obsessed with the subject there was no need to refer to them there's not much here for an intelligent adult audience either . of course if lee hall had been told at the script development stage by the producers that he should write a story featuring a schoolboy and an angel and had flatly refused saying that he wanted to write about other themes and stories then i will apologise but throughout the movie you do get the feeling that once the film was completed it was going to be marketed to the exact same audience who enjoyed billy elliot
1			project	new	standby	old	i	disappointed	slop	old	same	old	manhattanites	neurotic			i am so disappointed . this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy . here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again the neurotic upper class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses . woody , i have seen these characters already , i have seen the storyline from you ten times already . where did your creativity go ? ? you need to open your eyes and look around you . the world has changed dramatically since annie hall and you need to change along with it . there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again . when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out , it does nothing for me because now i have come to expect his old standby the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating . depressing and same old , same old . if woody wants to win his fans back , then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated not insulted .

1			lama	young	book	famous	i	disappointed	buddha	young			i read the book 7 years in tibet from heinrich harrer and was fascinated of it . then i immediately grabbed the dvd and started to watch the movie . i remember the first time i saw it back in 98 i kinda liked it . well , now i watched it again in full knowledge of the book it is based on . and soon i realized how wrong it all was told when they enter lhasa the people start to stick their tongues out of their mouths and thewlis and pitt have the impression that its the way to say hello in tibet , so they greet back . in the book harrer explains , that sticking the tongue out is a sign of absolute humbleness and loyalty in tibet and they may do it in front of the dalai lama but certainly not for these two europeans ! not only the mother but even the dalai lama himself was wearing glasses in the public . in the book harrer mentions , that no one in tibet wore glasses to that time sorry forgot the reason , but its explained in the book too . the young dalai lama did , but only when he was alone and nobody could see him ! and what about that mao tse tung lookalike , destroying the mandala in front of the young living buddha ? childish . and the tailor made harrer and aufschnaiter tibetan clothes not european designer suits ! why are so many events that really happened eliminated from the story , just to fill the time with a fictional love interest the female tailor . that is completely unimportant ? just like the whole story about harrers son , rolf . not one word is mentioned about him or even any family member of harrer in the book . but that was ok for me because 7 years in tibet is not a book about harrers person . its about tibet . i m very disappointed by this adaption of the famous book . and i bet heinrich harrer was , too . 3 stars , just for the cinematography .
1			sadism	emotional			why would a person go back to a person , who kicks them in the teeth , not once , not twice , but over and over again . this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it , but fully accept it . gosh ! no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years . i obviously wasn not embracing my inner masochi st as bucatinsky's writing debut , there are many wonderful aspects to this film ; however , in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom , more character development would have been helpful . we are never acquainted with eli's masochism , in fact , we are led to believe that he is not a masochist , although tom's psycho emotional sadism is highly evident .
1			blame	equal	child	golden	guys	bad	seems	dated	one	serious	movies	different	start	bad			i remember when the golden child was released in 1986 it was universally panned by the critics , and i`m talking panned so badly that it more or less ended the glittering career of eddie murphy so i guess this movie has something going for it it gets off to a bad start where buddist monks kneel in front of a child with a blank expression on his face . bad guys enter the temple child sits with blank expression bad guys chop up the monks child sits with blank expression bad guys pull out giant bird cage and stick the child inside who now sits with . go on guess ? you do get the impression that even if they were taking him for a sleepover at michael jackson`s wonderland ranch he`d still give the same blank expression , this movie would be better titled the wooden child the title sequence starts and being a movie from the 1980 a pop soundtrack features heavily . obviously this might have been cool and funky at the time but now in 2004 it seems very dated . not only that but it jars completely with the somewhat bloody opening . in fact that`s the main problem and boy it`s a serious one with this movie the whole mood seems to change from scene to scene so much so that sometimes it`s like watching scenes from totally different movies spliced together . i blame the director personally but it should also be pointed out that both the screenwriter and producer should share equal blame too . did anyone know before shooting commenced what type of movie this was going to be ? it`s part fantasy , part martial arts , part buddy movie , part comedy and it`s all crap
1			decency	moral	taste	bad	brow	low			i was expecting a movie similar to deuce bigalow , which i enjoyed . however , this dud seemed to last forever . it's one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of pg -13 while not being kid appropriate . the jokes aren not just low brow or f t jokes , they are crude , lewd , and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency . many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the pg -13 might have made a bigger splash as an r rated film if the funny was left in . overstatement ? probably . i do not recommend this movie . it is a full on waste of i m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot . at 45 minutes in , the movie felt like it should be winding boy were we ready for it to . the ending is quaint but doesn not salvage the rest of this quagmire / tourist trap of a rental . 1 2 star glad i saw it as a freebie . would have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe
1			non	bad	film	funny	it	funny	horror	real	plot	real	feel	cheated	it	bad	taste	bad	film	low	it	welcome	film	worst			this has to be the worst film i have ever seen . i bought the dvd and it didn not work , well the dvd worked fine , its just the film didn not , in fact its so bad that i think non of the actors have worked since or before judging from the acting . there is no real plot to speak of and no real horror . the production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphone . all in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didn not know any better which have been an improvement . there are only two lines in the film that are funny , both of which revolve around the transvestite prostitute . although they hardly merit watching all 76 minutes for as for the marketing of the dvd i feel thoroughly cheated . i mean reading the back i expected it to be bad he chose his weapons . he selected his victi ms he picked his nose . he turned into a girl ! but i thought it might be funny . also the case claims it is digitally re mastered , i would love to have seen it beforehand , the print is so grainy you could use it as sand paper . the case also says it is an absolute disgusting movie , in what way ? disgusting production , acting . this film out stays it welcome in the first five minutes , if you are considering buying this i would say buy `bad taste instead it is a much better film and is funny , also it has peter jackson the director of the lotr in it . incidentally if anyone knows anything about any of the actors or director patrick j mathews and what they have done since , please post here as i would love to know , purely to find out if there is a worse movie out there , or if anyone in this film ever bothered to learn to act
1			film	worst	it	bad	weapons	automatic	way	stupid	thing	positive	seemed	comical	people	dead	zombies	terrible	films	worst			this is one of the worst films i have seen . the only positive thing i can say is it was so bad that is seemed comical . first off , there's no plot . the actors appear to be reading off cue cards and do the dumbest things . such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends . also the zombies were terrible , no where near as fun as any of romero's work , who gets s plug in the movie . and the dumbest part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences . like we don not get the video game is about shooting zombies . also , all the 20 somethings some how know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun . and the way the people die is so stupid . it's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on . and when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open , so dumb . final verdict if any of these actors appear in another film , then they have been blessed with a second chance . definitely the worst film i have seen in years . a b movie on cinemax is better .

1			comer	new	bodies	dead	moment	serious	comer	young	teacher	young			this movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school , watching as the rawandan genocide un furls around him . the movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of rawanda . then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic new comer a young teacher who doesn not take life or the situation too seriously . as he and the driver approach a road block he plays around with his drivers i . d . not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can not identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they will be killed . and thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him . suddenly realizes that every rawandan including his driver is involved and that the europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help . the media cameras cannot stop machete's , and there's too many machete wielding militia men too shoot . the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead bodies around his compound , but won not shoot the militia men that are killing people around the compound . mainly because they haven not fired at the soldiers yet . finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims , flees with his tail in between his legs , rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind . it's more of character study , and a come to jesus moment for one character , than a story about the genocide in rawanda . this movie didn not have to take place in rawanda , it could have taken place any one of the genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time .

1			lines	open	comment	previous	work	bad	direction	bad	beginning	good	taste	bad	i	generous no			i agree with the previous comment , the beginning of the movie is quite good , and get's you wandering about what is to come . . which is nothing . all open story lines remain open ; two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture , save for 1 or 2 very short scenes . i wander if ilya wouldn not have done better to just completely leave them out . as for the one remaining character , nothing is done with her either . she just visits some god awful place , and suddenly the movie isn not about her anymore , but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread , drinking homemade vodka , and apparently flashing each other . some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling , like the judges of the iffr , but for me it is just bad taste , bad camera work , a lousy script and frightfully bad direction . therefor i can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 1

1			they	good	characters	difficult	writing	poor	susan	new	everyone	happy	characters	evil	bit	bad	characters	good	family	big	chicken	dead	mess	melodramatic			you would think that with ingrid bergman and warner baxter that this film would have been a lot better . sadly , the film suffers from difficult to believe characters as well as a major plot problem that makes some of the characters seem brain addled . the film begins with ingrid bergman coming to work for the stoddard family . everything is so very peachy and swell the family adores bergman and things couldn not be more perfect . well , that is until the mother fay wray dies , the stock market crashes in 1907 wiping out the family's fortune and bergman is forced to go back home to france . this portion of the film is a bit sticky sweet , but not bad . later , after the family's fortunes have improved , bergman returns . the four boys are now all grown and there isn not really a conceivable reason why they would hire her once again as a governess . but , briefly , everything is swell once again . but , when wwi occurs , the four all go to war gosh ! in the midst of this , one of the sons david brings home his new wife susan hayward . miss hayward's character is as black and white as the others , though while they are all good and swell , she's obviously a horny she devil . to make things worse , she comes to live in the family home while david is at war . now here is where the movie gets really , really dumb brain achingly dumb . hayward begins an affair with one of david's brothers but when the father sees a silhouette of the lovers , bergman enters the room from another entrance and pretends that it was her , not hayward with jack ! why ? why would any sane person do this to save the butt of an obviously evil and conniving woman ? this was exactly the sort of excuse bergman needed to get rid of the gutter snipe once and for all ! this is just a case of lousy writing and made me most likely did the same to the audiences back in 1941 the rest of the movie consists of failed opportunity after failed opportunity for hayward's evilness to be exposed . this just flies against common sense and made the film a silly melodramatic mess . as expected , however , the truth eventually comes out and everyone is swell once again happy to be one big loving wonderful family minus the slut , haywa rd the film suffers because of poor writing . hayward's affair made no sense at least in how it was handled . and , having characters who are so gosh darn good or evil with nothing in between sinks this movie to the level of a second rate soap . the only thing that saves it at all is the acting they tried as best they could with a turgid script . suffice to say that the columbia pictures writers who did this film should have been slapped with a dead chicken !

1			sin	worst	states	united	meaning	philosophical	i	sorry			first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere . however , i will rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version . i found this movie excruciatingly dull . all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie . i m sorry , but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy . i didn not see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie . maybe i missed something , but i have to tell it like i see it . i rated it a 1 . what can i say , the united states oriented tastes , maybe .

1			props	absurd	one	bad	anything	decent			surely no saturday morning tv kids show was ever done this poorly . after all , those producers had to count on the audience coming back . well , in this awful offering , they could at least count the money they saved on sets . the script could have been a reject from some long forgotten space opera serial , with a few smarmy lines added for cool dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden . no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline , so the action just plods boringly along . the spaceship props are absurd a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter , for example but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history . most are crude drawings , and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light . even mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop . and it's a bad one as rib thin as the plot . any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians and will probably agree completely !

1			price	good	they	funny	cortese	amazing			this movie started out good , i felt like i was watching an adult version of seinfeld . much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters , and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing . all the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny . dan cortese was amazing . i loved him in this role . his agent should show this movie to casting agents . watch the first few scenes and then find something better , or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess . i found this in a bin at a video store . it cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price .
1			dialog	horrible	hoot	real	creature	little	it	funny	budget	low	stamp	little	it	fun			i couldn not believe some of the horrible dialog coming out of people's mouths , and the end reel of bloopers attached to body of the film was a real hoot . and we get titty shots of angelique pettyjohn sort of and loren crabtree to boot . a teleportation device activated by psychic angelique pettyjohn brings an alien container to an underground lab out in the desert . according to director fred olen ray , they were leftover sets from the klaus kinski film , android which gives the film an increased value beyond how cheap it looks . inside the container is a midget alien played by ray's son who starts clawing people to death . it was pretty funny watching this little creature in a black reptile suit with what looks like large beetle shells attached to it , running around in the dark . we even get to see the little thing stamp and tear at a poster of et , which i thought was hilarious . and then there's what looks like a snake that also comes out of the container that gets hammered to death by william fair , after the mini creature chews into frank mcdonald's neck in the kitchen . a low budget take on alien , i suppose . the whole thing ends abruptly , looking like they ran out of film at the end before the blooper reel comes in with the end credits . talk about a lack of funding . fred olen ray also mentions in the director's commentary that they also weren not sure if aldo ray would make through the shooting and remember his lines . he barely did . low budget cheese sneeze . it's fun to watch , i will grant ya that . 4 out of 10
1			man	young	man	old	scenes	gory	gaffe	great	body	dead	i	crazy no	thanks	dead			what's this ? a canadian produced zombie flick that i have never heard of before . a mortician works on the body of a recently deceased young man . this allows for an extended flashback that show how the guy got there . basically , he and friends went to a cemetery on friday the 13 h and raised the dead thanks to his silly chanting . cut back to the morgue where our dead body comes back to life and kills the mortician and owner who gets his eyes popped out . the final wtf ? shot has the funeral home owner in a straight jacket and screaming , i m not crazy ! amazingly , he has his eyeballs back . running a scant 58 minutes , this is certainly one oddity in zombie cinema . it feels a lot longer , but put me in some kind of trance where i couldn not stop watching . the film also has one of those if you see this image , turn away from the screen gags . it is the image of an old man getting sick in a theater prophetic ? and when he pops up only twice the blood begins to flow . the scenes are pretty damn gory for the time period . there is a great gaffe where a zombie chops off a girl's right hand with a shovel , but when he pulls the fake hand into the frame to chomp on it is a left hand .

1			wonders	unbelievable	acting	bad	failure	total	product	good	film	french	makers	french			one wonders why this picture was made at all the plot as such is totally unbelievable if not ridiculous , the characters experienced loner cop versus younger one , quite fascinated quite predictable , the ending totally murky and impossible to understand maybe after several viewings but you would have to have a masochistic tendency for that ; the idea being you have to read the book to understand fully what it's all about and the acting is bad . was the basic idea to show that french film makers are able to do as well as americans in the genre that include seven and silence of the lambs ? if so , it is a total failure . it was quite a success though and has a sort of cult status as the first french serial killer film and , it seems , considered as a good product to export . strange .
1			productions	big	story	poor	star	biggest	success	biggest	taiwan	golden	mistake	biggest	he	mediocre	flower	golden	actors	famous	movie	terrible			this movie is made for asian / chinese market , targeting particularly fans of jay chou , one of the biggest music star in asian . jay chou is a very talented song writer / singer . he is mediocre as an actor , although he did appear in several big budget productions initial d , curse of the golden flower . amazingly , he won both golden horse taiwan and hong kong film awards for initial d . the supporting cast are very well chosen , which appeals basically everyone from china . the cast including many famous movie / tv actors , singers , even sport commentator huang jianxiang from china . however , they were not given enough time to show their talents . the biggest mistake is that chu took over both director and writer position . he has a reputation of making shallow and brainless movies based off non coherent scripts . with his poor directing and lam story , the whole talented cast , fancy vision effects and tones of production money was wasted . however , the terrible movie successfully cashed in over 10 million dollars , maybe even more in asian , which made this one of the biggest box office success in asian . the bottom line is you can watch this movie only if you want to see how money and talents are wasted , or if you are simply accompanying your kids who are fans of jay chou .
1			opinion	low	work	great	one	difficult no	reason	real	one	superficial			the premise of the movie has been explained and if you have gotten this far you don not me to pretend that i m a movie critic . with that being said my own opinion of the movie is quite low . i m a fan of takashi miike but this goes down in the category of his not so great work along with doa 2 and 3 and some others many . the movie seems to get a free pass because it is a takashi film and nothing takashi does can be wrong . this is a highschoolers approach to cinema . for the rest of us we will find and hour and a half of a kid screaming for no real reason completely annoying and yes , this does take away from the film , the pace of the film almost reaching levels of rigomortis , and the if one is a takashi fan you will see it regardless to peak your interests . it lacks any originality see the neverending story or any character development from the lead character in the face of conflict other then a quite superficial one . as it has been pointed out this is the first film miike has been credited with co writing , but that doesn not mean much as non of what we would hope would be miike's personality would spill over into the screen . all we get are some of the token miike shots vis the director of photography . the movie had the potential to be something great . the premise is not a difficult one to run wild with . but this one seemed to have been run into the ground . my suggestion is if you are just getting into miike is go with some of the standards like gozu , ichi , and audition . then movie into his works like blue's harp , fudoh , rainy dog , bird people of china .
1			shatner	tolerable	star	original	rest	good			william shatner in small doses is tolerable . unfortunately , instead of leaving his character as a minor irritation , and in that moderately amusing , it has been seen fit to enlarge his role and overdo it . just as occurred in the original star trek series . i guess i will never understand american humour , which frequently goes over the top to get the message through . i vote with my feet . i no longer watch the show , which is a shame , because the rest of the cast were good . it is pity that shatner's overdone role also , affects james spader's performance . but the majority demonstrate the way society is going , i guess . i don not travel the same routes . frank
1			performances	ridiculous	effects	special	networks	popular	they	pathetic	film	low	bit	little	fan	big	i	aware	crime	serious	things	concerned			this sure is one comedy i m not likely to forget for a while . wouldn not normally bother to comment on this movie it's so minor that no one would watch it anyway , but as it happens , it's kind of popular in p 2 sharing networks such as kazaa , and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is . so what is it then ? well , of course it's not really a comedy ; instead , it's intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here . the script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess , the special effects are only special in that they are especially pathetic , and as for the acting , well , let's just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school , my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent . of course i realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one's expectations , certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned . also , even though i m a big fan of the horror genre , i m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting . but still . b movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding , such as humour . the only laughs in cradle to fear lie in the ridiculous performances . if you can find the humour in that and i could for the first 20 minutes or so , gradually dozing off after that then that's going to be the only thing the movie has to offer . oh , that and two or three pairs of breasts . woohoo , how exciting . as for the story , it's not even that it doesn not try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and / or are involved in serious crime . the lesson watch out , naughty boys and girls , because one day you will be made to pay for what you have done . i rest my case . so , all in all , a little bit of sex , a fair amount of drugs , but absolutely zero rock n roll . i rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if i could . or perhaps i wouldn not it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles . i mean , that's something , innit ?
1			regret	biggest	it	awful	opportunity	great			this movie starts slow , then tapers off . after watching for about an hour , and seeing absolutely nothing happen , i walked out . i mean , nothing happened . zero . zip . nada . there is no story . the characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know . the producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture . there is no motion . i could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions . the script is a joke . it's just awful . i doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it . my biggest regret is not that i wasted 60 minutes of my life watching love in the time of money , but that i missed a great opportunity to be a leader . i could have been the first to walk out , but i waited a bit too long . instead , i watched about 20 people walk out before me .

1			line	original	set	real no	movies	ridiculous			american film makers decided to make a film they think is japanese . the characters all badly represented , the actors are not even japanese and the set is cheap , unreal and definitely doesn not represent kyoto in early 20 ies and 30 ies . who ever read the book understand that the script writers didn not add any extra value to differentiate the movie from the script . worse , they even changed the original plot line with a few goofs . rob marshall is using for his two main characters two well known chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon . marshall probably saw one chinese movie and tho they represent japanese culture . seeing those two actors together again even makes the movies more ridiculous . quentine tarantino's last scene in kill bill 1 is ten times more japanese made than that of this movie .

1			distortion	horrible	story	wrong	lie	complete	scam	horrible			this movie is a horrible distortion of lies and exaggerations that were put together by the most shameless lunatics to ever work on a tv movie . the story is wrong and a complete lie . there is nothing in this movie that accurately portrays senator mccarthy . it's just a horrible scam and it amazes me that anyone associated with this production ever got another job in the industry . the marxist leninists who wrote this trash did so in order to attack a man who has been vindicated by history and their fear that anyone would dare to destroy communism . unfortunately for these communist nut jobs , ronald reagan took over where mccarthy left off and they couldn not stop him , thus the end of the soviet union and its cohorts . never , ever watch this film if you are looking for truth regarding sen . mccarthy . read ann coulter's book , treason for a better look at the truth about sen . mccarthy . it will also help if you read about what really happened to senator mccarthy by reading

1			character	noble no	story	true	it	true	sex	graphic	artemisia	real	charges	false			i was disgusted by this movie . no it wasn not because of the graphic sex scenes , it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi . this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art . it shows one piece of art work that she did judith beheading holofernese but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial . i don not know if you understood this from the movie , probably not , tassi was not a noble character . he raped artemisia . it was not love , it was rape . he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured . according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia aka had sex with while she states over and over again it's true . i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about . don not base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie . i encourage you to do some research , artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work . don not see the movie , but find out the true story of artemisia .

1			ben	exceptional	mess	forgettable	he	young	go	big	antics	stupid	performance	solid	film	incredible	movie	bad	looney	old	show	original	fans	hard			thunderbirds 2004 director jonathan frakes starring bill paxton , ben kingsley , brady corbet 54321 thunderbirds are go ! and so began thunderbirds , a childhood favorite of mine . when i heard that they were going to make a thunderbirds movie , i was ecstatic . i couldn not wait to see thunderbird 2 roar in to save people , while thunderbird 4 would dive deep into theyou get the idea . i just couldn not wait . then came august 2004 when the movie was finally released . critics panned it , but i still wanted to go . after all , as long as the heart was in the same place , that was all that mattered to me . so i sat down in the theater , the only teenager in a crowd of 50 veryone else was over thirty and under ten . quite possibly the most awkward theater experience that i have ever had the movie which is intended to be a prequel focuses on alan tracy brady corbet , the youngest of the tracy family . he spends his days wishing that he could be rescuing people like the rest of his family , but he's too young . one day , he finally gets his chance when the hood ben kingsley traps the rest of his family up on thunderbird 5 the space station . this involves him having to outsmart the hood's henchmen and rescue his family in time before the hood can steal all of the money from the bank of england . trust me , the plot sounds like a regular episode of thunderbirds when you read it on paper . once it gets put on to filmwhat a mess we have on our hands . first off , the film was intended for children , much like the original show was . however , gerry anderson treated us like adults , and gave us plots that were fairly advanced for children's programming . this on the other hand , dumbs down the plot as it tries to make itself a ripoff of the spy kids franchise . the final product is a movie that tries to appeal to fans of the thunderbirds series and children , while missing both entirely . lame jokes , cartoonish sounds , and stupid antics that no one really finds amusing are all over this movie , and i m sure that jonathan frakes is wishing he would never directed this . over all , everyone gave a solid performance , considering the script that they were all given . ben kingsley was exceptional as the hood , playing the part extremely well . my only complaint about the characters is about the hood's henchmen , who are reduced to leftovers from old looney tunes cartoons , bumbling about as , amazingly enough , the kids take them on with ease . what's odd about this movie is that while i was watching the movie , i had fun . but once the lights went up , i realized that the movie was fairly bad , i was $ 8 lighter , and two hours of my time were now gone . a guilty pleasure ? perhaps . nonetheless , thunderbirds is a forgettable mess . instead of a big go , i m going to have to recommend that you stay away from this movie . if the rest of movie could have been like the first ten minutes of it , it would have been an incredible film worthy of the thunderbirds name . however , we get a movie that only die hard thunderbirds fans if you would like to watch your childhood torn to pieces or the extremely bored should bother with . my rating for thunderbirds is 1 stars .

or maybe did they just adapt the worst parts of the legend ? the film begins with a fight sequence that would let anyone hope the film will have battle scenes . unfortunately , it is the only battle scene of the film . then you see daniel emilfork who was krank in city of lost children for about two seconds , and that would let anyone hope the film will have good acting . unfortunately he is very bad in the film . the same thing can be said about italian actor nino manfredi , who was one of italia's best actors ever , and who here is condemned to embody a crazy bird wrangler with no back story whose only purpose is to seem to be the wise man of the film . and boy , does that film need wiseness ! every other character of the story seems to enjoy swimming in excrement , yelling , torturing others in excrement , fornicating in excrement or laying in excrement some more just for the fun of it . it seems to be such fun that each character of the story gets to have his or her turn being dumped in feces at a point or another . coming from a dutch director , you might think that extreme dirtiness and shockingly real filth are necessary elements in a period piece , elements which contributed to make dutch filmmaker paul verhoeven's film , flesh blood , such a great film . the thought of flesh blood would let anyone hope that a film similarly filthy and visually straight forward would be good . unfortunately , and unlike flesh blood , there is no dramatic progression , no fights , no good acting , and put simply , no flesh and blood . the photography , as the opening sequence unfolds , is well done and enticing . this too , stops very early in the film . the music , from nicola piovani of la vit e bella fame is repetitive and annoying , when not irrelevant it sometimes implies that there is grandeur in a sequence , while on screen the actors are splashing in liquid dung . throughout the first act of the film , which lasts nothing less than an hour ! the film takes place within the same perimeter , which is around the farm where the main characters live . the characters play with excrement a lot , drown in it , play in it . a long period of time elapses through numerous ellipses to allows the main character , a young boy who loves to play in excrement , to become older and play in excrement some more . the bird man talks a lot to say foolish things in italian . spanish conquistadors speak french . nothing makes sense . everything is confused and takes hours to happen . then there is a second act called the ship , in which we see what might have been a ship , a long time ago , but which is now remains of a ship covered with excrement did i mention ? the main character , while walking a bit further away from the farm , just happens to run into it , and decides it's really cool so let's live in it . the hunchback who lived in it before is trying to kill him , but he doesn not really mind because did i mention ? he's not very bright . he thinks the ship can navigate and hopes to sail on it , until more conquistadors show up at least they seemed to be conquistadors because of the don quixote style hats but as i have said it's really confused who's who , make the dutchman a prisoner , along with the retarded hunchback , and they burn the ship to the ground . the last part of the film , which is really hard to bear for the spectator because it just consists of even more excrement with even more retarded middle age peasants fighting in it , takes place in a mad asylum . yet more torture and drowning each other with feces . yet more loitering for the director , who seems to have definitely given up on his job , or passed onto the second crew camera assistant to do the rest of the job . in the end , a lot of the mentally challenged new friends that the dutchman made die . the woman he had sex with who was his brother's wife to begin with tries to have him meet his son . the dutchman and his son talk . the film ends after two hours of dungy images and calamitous acting and technical performances . then the credits roll and the spectator fells immensely free from having to watch atrocious films with no plot that pretend to be something exciting like fantasy films based on legends , while they are nothing but a mere catalog of how full of excrement some films can get when they don not have enough financing powers to put battles instead or even horses .
1			script	terrible	ms	previous	actors	bad	actors	unbelievable	waste	total			bad actors , terrible script , totally unbelievable ending this film had it all . after seeing films like this , you wonder why the makers bothered at all . this film has absolutely nothing to say , all the methods used to create a scare have been used over and over again in previous horror fil ms a total waste of time .
1			effects	special	nothing	original	treatment	great	nothing	special no	movie	worth	it	worth no			this movie is worth watching if you enjoy marvelling over special effects . there are some interesting visuals . aside from that , it's typical nineties / aughties hollywood fare of dazzle without substance . true to the title . it's not worth picking apart the story . that's like performing brain surgery on a dinosaur . there's not much there to begin with . it's nothing original and not very special . so don not go in for the story at all . just look at the effects . as has been mentioned , it got a little flashy at the end , diluting the purity of great fx treatment of an invisible and at times half invisible man . however if you ignore the standard pyrotechnics , it's a sight to behold or not to behold . all in all , it's a decent fx film worth seeing for that purpose and that alone .
1			frame	fantastic	looked	real	fan	hard	looked	alive	community	open	i	glad	characters	animated	tools	open			this was thought to be the flagship work of the open source community , something that would stand up and scream at the worlds media to take notice as we are not stuck in the marketing trap with our options in producing fine work with open source tools . after the basic version download die hard fan here on a dial up modem eventually got here i hit my first snag . media player , mplayer classic & winamp failed to open it on my xp box , and then totem , xine & kaffeine failed to open it on my suse server . mplayer managed to run it flawlessly . going to be hard to spread the word about it if normal users cant even open it . the film . beautiful soundtrack , superb lighting , masterful camera work and flawless texturing . everything looked real . and then the two main characters moved . and spoke . and the movie died for me . everything apart from the lip syncing and the actual animation of the two main characters except for proog in the dancing scene looked fluid and totally alive . the two main characters were animated so poorly that at times i was wondering if there are any games on the market at the moment with cut scenes that entail less realism than this . any frame in the movie is fantastic . as a frame , and the thing is great if neither actors are moving . i m so glad i haven not actually recommended this to anyone . i would ruin my reputation . oh , and final fantasy had a more followable and cunningly devised plot . this movie would get 10 stars if it wasn not for the tragedy that sits right there on the screen .
1			boys	old	him	hate	men	pathetic	clark	hate			joe don's opening line says everything about this movie . it takes place on the island of malta the island of pathetic men and involves joe don baker tracking down an italian mobster . joe don's character is named geronimo pronounced heronimo and all he does in this movie is shoot people and get arrested over and over agin . everyone in the movie hates him , just like everyone hates greydon clark . i liked an earlier greydon picture , angel's revenge because it was a shirne for thriteen year old boys . avoid this movie at all costs !
1			acting	horrific	budget	low	i	worst	movie	worth no	horrible	horrible			horrible , horrible , horrible do not waste your money to rent this movie . its like a low budget made for tv canadian movie . absolutely the worst movie i have ever seen and there have been many others out there . this movie is not worth the time it takes to put it in the dvd player or vcr . is it possible to write ten lines ? the acting was horrific . it had absolutely no flow . i saw the made for tv movie on the btk killer and it was much better in comparison to this one . i am not sure what they were going for in producing this film but if it was to educate us or tell a story about the btk killer they missed by a mile . it appeared to be more of a infomercial for animal rights .
1			novel	gorgeous			this movie is not only poorly scripted and directed but is simply distasteful . a beautiful novel is terribly misrepresented in this film . many changes have been made to the storyline , presumably to streamline the timeframe . but what results is simply confusing . the acting can not possibly overcome the script which removes the characters motives for their behavior . plus , the conversion to english does not work when everyone refers to the patriarch esteban as esteban . horrible . please please please read the gorgeous novel , in spanish if possible . don not see this film . it will ruin for you what could be a wonderful experience .
1			it	humorous	willpower	good	movie	worst			this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen . it is humorous how bad it is . the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancing . i have seen porno's with a better plot when the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away . but as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isn not going to do anything compared to if you watch it . i don not recommend renting it but if it comes on tv watch it for about 30 in just to see what i mean . i couldn not watch more than 30 in but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower
1			movie	worst	movie	worth no			this movie is by far the worst movie ever made . if you have to create a film costarring the guy who plays lars in heavyweights than don not make the damn film . i have to say that i could watch leprechaun in space 6 times before i could watch the trailer for this pos of a movie . adam sandler should be restricted from any movie after this disgrace . watching this movie is like a mix of listening to cher and willingly putting your dick in a blender . anyone with half of a brain cell will realize that this movie is not worth a dime . if i had an extra dollar and had to spend it , i would give it to the support lorraina bobbitt foundation before buying this movie .
1			premises	big	episode	consistent no	episode	remarkable	you	insane			i just don not get some of the big premises of this episode that miranda is so remarkable , and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane . someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness . miranda is just a jerk . the episode is slow , inconsistent and way too talky . i also don not quite understand why kolos is an ambassador why doesn not the federation just leave the damn medusans be ? there's one part i do like , when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience . overall , i love tos and even at its lamest , i will always tune in . this episode though mmm , i wouldn not purchase it except for a used copy under $ 3
1			performances	laughable	everything	inept	me	wrong	effects	visual	script	bad	cgi	atrocious	problem	fundamental	films	good	ghoul	hideous	horror	british	i	wrong	singer	great			by all accounts , this could have been an interesting film . featuring a score by the mighty cradle of filth , starring their frontman dani and being hyped up as the future of british horror , i expected alex chandon's gore fest to live up to the hype . i was wrong . everything about this film is either cliche or inept . the short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties . admittedly , the idea of not he sick room did send a chill down my spine , but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting . chandon cannot write dialogue . every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence the typical cop on the edge formula . funny , i m sure i have seen that somewhere else before . no chandon , you are not tarantinumber or scorsese . it sounds bad . add ludicrously ott acting with very dodgy casting don not get me wrong , dani filth is a great singer and musician , but actor he ain not and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing . give me bruce campbell any day . the visual effects are on the whole poor , with some atrocious cgi , awful gore effects for goodness sakes , peter jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing filters that shriek over use ! as for the often mistimed use of cradle of filth's score . man , they should sue . the fundamental problem with cradle of fear is that it takes itself seriously , trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience . too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects eg maniac , zombie flesh eaters , the beyond , suspiria etc , rendering cradle of fear , in my mind , second rate and obsolete . i hope chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares . better luck next time .

did he want the sex to tell the stories , or did he believe the characters would ? he failed in this sense because by the end of the film we know so little about y and j that we could care less how they resolve themselves . the ending seems almost random at best as jang attempts to create a final resolution for our two , absolute unknowns , of this film . i have to give jang some credit for trying , but not much . he attempted to create some sub stories that would create the personal element that we were lacking , but they just couldn not congeal well together . y's brother and j's wife were those plot points , but again , due to him focusing so strongly on the sexual element , these stronger sub stories became un rememberable and down right dull . maybe it was just how i viewed this film , but outside of the sexual scenes , nothing else worked together . we knew nothing about j and y and that is why gojitmal failed . finally , i would like to say that this film could have benefited from having a strong score or a daftly remote music genre element to it to bring us , the viewers , closer to the emotions being felt by j and from what i can remember , and i am trying to push this film far from my mind , i don not remember any musical undertones . gojitmal may have been a stronger film if jang either stylized it with music or done something to allude towards our character's beings . while i understand that he wanted the sex to speak for itself , there was just a technical element missing from this film that may have quenched a stronger desire for more . technically , this was a poor film . obviously an independent film in nature , it felt more like director jang was trying to make symbolic references out of nothing instead of your typical independent of this nature . i didn not see as much of a social message or human element like mentioned above , i just felt like he threw this film together over the course of two weeks and understood that the sex would sell it enough . this was no larry clark production ; this was sub par and definitely needed some further technical clicks to develop it stronger than the final release ! overall , i think i could have liked this film and there were smaller elements that i did enjoy , but i felt this film was rushed , repetitive , and played too much towards the taboos instead of breaking them . the obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived . our characters were uneventful , our story was underdeveloped , and we could have used something memorable to make what was happening between y and j into something more symbolic than sex . to me , jang was trying too much to capture art house meets pornographic and it failed miserably . this was not a film worth the time and effort that it took to make . grade out of
1			kline	worth	character	annoying	character	likeable			kevin kline and meg ryan are among that class of actors which i am always interested in seeing , despite reviews . i have always found ms ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles , and kevin kline is almost always worth watching . i say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie . first off , meg ryan does not play a likeable character , she plays a weak willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn not give up until several days later . that said , kevin kline's character is even more annoying and less likeable . so , even if you normally like these two actors , i recommend your give this movie a pass .

1			plot	bad	ben	real	lines	horrible	acting	best	plot	bad no	attempt	horrible	look	expensive	felt	ashamed			this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips / commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie . on one hand the imagery , camera , lighting , cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly expensive look and feel . even the actors show a certain amount of potential unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot . in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all . so 50 of the dialog consists of what the hell was that ? what was that ? and what the hell was that ? in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though . in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn not ever explained to them . the only reason why skye bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn not allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with . that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn not even get close to . i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this ben is this real , huh ? emily stop it . ben a mass psychosis , huh ? jon somebody has to take control of this situation . ben this situation can not be controlled . not by you , not by anybody . emily not by you either . ben no got me goosebumps . but not for horror , more for the horrible attempt . in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita . 2 stars for the excellent technical work .

1			plaudits	good	bland	amateurish	budget	low	dancing	ordinary	daughter	old	cabaret	local	adult	young			well , you would better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish , bland , and pokey flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like . set in tunis , mom piddles around the flat , gets antsy , and decides , albeit reluctantly she just can not help herself , to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret . meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons . the common denominator is a tunisian band drummer . this film is so full of filler i watched the dvd at x 2 and read the subtitles , fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x 4 just to get though this boring , uneventful , low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits . go figure . c

1			looks	cheap	they	good	performances	believable	humor	incestuous	chemistry	good	movie	worst no			not as bad as you have hea rd there are actually some funny parts and affleck and applegate have fairly good chemistry . applegate , in particular , is appealing and likable as affleck's love intere st james gandolfini and catherine o hara are consummate professionals . they are pretty good in just about everything . in the end , surviving is not the worst holiday movie you will ever see . unfortunately , it is unfocused and much of the comedy is forced . the attempts at dark humor come off as dour . affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic but comes across as disturbed . his character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to gandolfini and o hara's more muted , believable performances . even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies , you never fully buy into the set up of affleck renting this family for x mas . there are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness . the x mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor a son being discovered looking at naked , provocative pictures of his mother that not only isn not funny or believable but disturbing . to make matters worse , the colors in this film are muddy , almost noirish . the house set on which most of the movie takes place looks stagey and cheap . surviving is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office duds paycheck , gigli , jersey girl , and this for affleck . it remains to be seen how lasting the damage will be .
1			it	boring	nothing	different	humour	consistent	nothing	new	home	original	plot	similar	film	good	films	previous	boy	young			home alone 3 is the first of the home alone movies not to feature culkin in the main role and the same villains . however , the plot is very similar to the original home alone film . instead of two comical villains , we get three or four of them . this film involves some traps , but it also has a long scene with a remote control car . the slapstick humour is consistent as well , but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film . no pun intended . this film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did , and there really is not the warm , holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had . it's more of a pure comedy , but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me . i would not recommend this film ; it's pretty boring . if you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy , then watch the original home alone movie .
1			film	old	plot	boring	disappointment	complete	choices	realistic no	movie	bad	he	great			i love dracula but this movie was a complete disappointment ! i remember lee from other dracula films from when i was younger , and i thought he was great , but this movie was really bad . i don not know if it was my youth that fooled me into believing lee was the ultimate dracula , with style , looks , attraction and the evil underneath that . or maybe it was just this film that disappointed me . but can you imagine dracula with an snobbish english accent and the body language to go along with it ? do you like when a plot contains unrealistic choices by the characters and is boring and lacks any kind of tension . then this is a movie for you ! otherwise don not see it ! i only gave it a 2 because somehow i managed to stay awake during the whole movie . sorry but if you liked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you . maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home . cause not even the characters in this flick seemed afraid , and i think that sums up the whole thing ! or maybe you like this film because of it's place in dracula cinema history , perhaps being fascinated by how the dracula story has evolved from nosferatu to what it is today . cause as movie it isn not that appealing , it doesn not pull you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the vampyre myth so fascinating . and furthermore it has so much of that tacky 70 es feel about it . the scenery looks like cheap theatre . and i don not say that rejecting everything made in the 70 es . cause i can love old film as well as new .

1			choice	wrong	she	straight	affair	necessary no	douglas	old	thriller	classic	movies	fun	movie	fun no	scenes	big no			i saw the trailer of the film several times at theater and i excited . it looked like a classic action thriller like the ones made in 1990 s . it recalled me also fugitive movies , a cat and mouse chase between douglas and sutherland . however , the sentinel is the most tasteless action thriller of all time . as i see , many people say that this is like a tv movie . not exactly . firstly , there are much more better tv movies in this genre . secondly , tv movies might be very fun sometimes , but this film is the exact opposite of having a good time . it is not stylish at all visually and the most important , the tone of the movie is unappealing . this is not an action movie , there are two action scenes consist of a chase and a clash . also they are not big action scenes , but the worse is that those action scenes are very tasteless like the whole movie . the love affair between douglas and bassinger was very unnecessary . besides , the assassination plot to the president is the most clich story in this genre either , but they insist on that . and this is not a cat and mouse film as it is supposed to be . although , douglas is very old now , he has still potential for acting in an action thriller . in the film , michael douglas cannot be like tommy lee jones , for example . sutherland is a wrong choice either , because you feel as if you watch jack bauer and somehow , its character is one of the reasons which make the film like a tv movie , eva longoria parker is a strange choice , of course she is too passive or straight in this movie , because she is a soap opera actress . the movie was not fun even one second to me , so i could not get over for a while .
1			force	special			if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie , then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you will never get back . i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re . first , a special commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection . and this hive rip off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time . there's even a chess reference in the code names , which was in the dialog of re . despite the fact that there are no zombies , the rook , the movie's nemesis , is some sort of bio creature , very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue , with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re . so , a wag of the finger to mr richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story . they are not the same movie obviously , but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think .

we have no real idea what caused the creepy central character to embark on his killing spree , despite the fact that large amounts of narrative voice over are drawn directly from his own narcissistic journal . in a routinely unpleasant opening sequence , set more than a decade earlier , we see the central character killing his girlfriend in a rage of jealousy and control freakery if i can not have you nobody can . oddly enough , that is perhaps one of the best sequences in the film , but it has no discernible relation to his subsequent killing spree , which appears completely different in both motivation and execution . what happened to him in jail to cause this change ? we have no idea , though we do later discover , as an absurd sort of afterthought , that he obtained a law degree while imprisoned . in britain , in several of our notorious serial killer or sex killer cases , the terrible question arises ; what about the wife ? did she know , or suspect what was going on ? this is a question that this film could have asked , and indeed the wife does begin to emerge as one of the more intriguing characters . but banally , the answer to the question is quite clearly no , she didn not . even when a dramatic opportunity like this is presented on a plate , the film still manages to bungle it . all we actually get , sketched perfunctorily out at the end , is her slightly amoral preparedness to cash in on the proceeds after the event . compare this to the awful revelatory moment in ten rillington place , where christie's wife says you know what i mean . thereby sealing her own fate and allowing us an appalled glimpse into unimaginable chasms of suppressed knowledge and horror . major spoiler in this paragraph . in the meantime , we are supposed to believe that the killer himself is a criminal mastermind who comprehensively outwits the police , thereby securing the briefest of incarcerations in a mental hospital before being released so that he can kill again . how exactly did he achieve this ? the plot gets extremely sketchy at this point ; something to do with deliberately leaving certain clues for the police ; but how this all works or why , or how the subsequent court case actually proceeds , remains a mystery . i actually don not believe serial killers are like this . the silence of the lambs may be comic book stuff , but lecter aside it gets its serial killers right . they are deeply disturbed , deeply dysfunctional , deeply inadequate people ; not the creepily charming mastermind presented here closely related to the equally implausible suave killer of the last horror movie , or indeed even man bites dog , though it appears not to have been noticed that that was a satire . this film has little suspense , and bungles what little intrigue the plot might have generated . it has nothing useful to say about the motivations of serial killers , either generally , or in the specific cultural milieu of spain . this is nothing more than a poorly plotted excuse to show some pretty misogynistic violence to women . and oddly , what makes that violence even more repulsive is a certain prissy failure of nerve even in how it is presented . the soft core character of what is actually shown just makes it seem even more repellently titillatory . just one explicit shot , properly timed , would have been infinitely more shocking , and would have rendered all the rest completely unnecessary , freeing up more film time to flesh out the gaping holes in plot and characterisation . instead we just get endless shots of young women vulnerably spreadeagled on a table in their pretty but slightly revealing underwear . very , very creepy . i m sorry to be rude ; i love horror films , and can tolerate even the most extreme , to the extent even of worrying my partner . but i think anyone who finds this film good , or interesting , even i would find myself edging away from . the purpose of a horror film is to scare you ; this is just lascivious . it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed . i have to give this film more than one star just because it's competently executed , but morally it deserves none at all and should never have been made .

1			margin	wide	performance	horrible			what did producer / director stanley kramer see in adam kennedy's novel and kennedy's very puzzling screenplay ? were there a few pieces left out on purpose ? and what about gene hackman , richard widmark , edward albert , eli wallach and mickey rooney ? what did they see in this very muddled story ? and why did candice bergen , who gave a horrible performance , accept such a thankless role ? the domino principle wants to be on the same footing as the parallax view or the manchurian candidate and misses the mark by a very wide margin . a major misfire by stanley kramer .
1			world	real	thing	real	it	wrong	writer	young	story	real	edge	similar	meaning	real			a friend told me of john fante last summer after we got into a conversation about charles bukowski . i did not know that fante was a favorite writer of bukowski's an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier . ask the dust was the first fante book i read , and it remains one of my favorite novels . the novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad , frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident , masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of . in the novel the protagonist is a virgin , with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines . the story of his bizarre relationship with camilla , how he settles for his first sexual experience with a wounded admirer , and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real , with no touching hollywood ending . the film adaptation stays true to the book for a while , but meanders into the cinematic trap of love persevering through racism , sickness and death . the heart of this story lies in the fact that bandini is a jerk and camilla is f ing crazy , and their love never was and never would be the real thing , no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other . this movie tore out the real meaning of the story out and replaced it with schlock . i can not believe the man who wrote chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so wrong .
1			law	historical	acting	good	it	entertaining	movies	different	i	disappointed	forwa	best	bit	little	episode	bad	shot	bad	end	easy	lady	old			i just finished watching this movie . it wasn not ridiculously bad , but i m really disappointed with it . i m not really sure why someone would make a movie like this . it was marginally entertaining , but i feel like the people making it had a lot of disagreements on what they were making . monday , the writer was in charge ; tuesday , the director ; wednesday , the guy who gets the coffee ; etc it almost seems like they really wanted to make a couple different movies , but only had the time and money to make one . someone else commented that the acting was really good , but i would have to disagree . then again , if the actors were able to keep a straight face during the filming , perhaps they are better actors than i give them credit for . the back of the dvd gives the impression that the movie would be a mystery . something along the lines of a historical law and order or national treasure . it starts off like that , but then , out of nowhere it takes a turn towards a bad episode of the twilight zone , or . what was that other show that wasn not as good . a bad episode of the outer limits . my main complaint about the movie is that it is just so played out . there's the evil guy with spiked white hair . there's the love interest , who , when she first appears , the wind actually blows through her hair . seriously . once you realize it's a christian movie , the end is also pretty easy to spot . the cinematography was poorly done , especially in the opening scenes way to put your best foot forwa rd it wasn not atrocious for most of the movie , but there was the occasional ridiculously bad shot of an old lady , praying , arms up in a dark room while lightening is striking the sort of thing that just makes you a little bit embarrassed to be watching the movie .
1			writing	bad	actor	real	it	great	thriller	political	thriller	hard			the main problem with power is that it features way too may pointless characters and subplots that add absolutely nothing to the movie whatsoever . it gets boring after awhile , sitting around waiting through scenes that don not connect to find something that drives the movie forwa rd you could probably pass it all off as character development , but all of them are either recycled from earlier scenes in the movie , or are just simply to flat and uninteresting . lumet never gives enough time to let any of the supporting cast blossom . he should have cut a few of the characters hackman , the wife and concentrated harder on others billings . it could have been a great , hard political thriller instead of a jumbled mess that loses any message in a sea of bad writing and acting , a fact that amazed me considering the ca st even gene hackman performance wasn not up to par . denzel washington is the only real actor of note here . gere and the others have all done much better performances elsewhere . sidney lumet needs to go back to the fierce one man shows he did in the seventies i . e , serpico and stop trying to recapture his success with 12 angry men and fail safe . it hasn not worked yet sidney , and it most likely never will . leave the ensemble dramas to altman . 3 10 /

1			showdown	inevitable	story	old	episode	inevitable	feels	familiar	lifestyle	criminal	do	romantic	people	little	accents	different	itself	meaningless	stake	personal			if the term itself were not geographically and semantically meaningless , one might well refer to ned kelly as an australian western . for the people down under , ned kelly was , apparently , a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood , jesse james , bonnie and clyde , and butch cassidy and the sundance kid . the descendant of irish immigrants , kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer , a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison . to get back at the government for this mistreatment , kelly , his brother dan , and two other companions , became notorious bank robbers , winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country . perhaps because we have encountered this gentleman bandit scenario so many times in the past , ned kelly feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre's stereotypes and clichs on its way to the inevitable showdown . ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and , even then , only with the deepest regret . he also has the pulse of the common folk , as when , in the middle of a bank robbery , he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers , after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it . what movie on this particular subject hasn not featured a scene like that ? it's acts of selective generosity like this , of course , that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo . geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment . there's even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers , so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle . and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another . heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role , providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging . it doesn not help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film . ned kelly might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history , but as an entertainment , it's just the same old story told with different accents .
1			plot	pathetic	acting	terrible	dalton	pathetic	sheriff	southern			so this was an hbo made for tv movie eh ? is that an excuse for such a pathetic plot and terrible acting ? such a shame to see jim belushi reduced to a role so repetitive shot at , survived , lies , beaten up , survives , shot at , lies and so ad infinitum . call that a script ? as for the brits , embarrassing to see timothy dalton's pathetic or was he just taking the p , depends how much he was paid i guess ? attempt at a southern sheriff . as for that other brit , the bleached blond one , what a w er ! there is a trend towards glorifying these english speaking sic super violent thugs lately , perhaps thanks to mr madonna's two movies succeed in entertaining and justify the violence by skillful use of irony and humour , like pulp fiction does . however , this movie discredits and devalues the genre . definately one to miss .

1			communism	international	elites	intellectual	movie	classic	story	real	dialogue	stilted	kos	daily			the sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine . this movie is no cabarnet and certainly no casablanca . i agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are an unfortunate mutation that now plagues us nightly in sit coms and the dialogue is stilted and preachy . but let's look at the obsolete theme of the movie . with the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom . since watch on the rhine , author lillian hellman has been exposed as a bidenesque plagiarist with her so called real life story julia from her book pentimento . as one of the most odious of a plethora of western based ussr apologists , it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir america to action to save the bloody soviet dictator stalin and international communism from the fascists , who had just proved their military superiority in spain . as one reviewer correctly noted , this is not a pro american play and movie , as lillian went to her grave an american loathing communi st this film chronicles that familiar smug stupidity of the intellectual elites that made up the american left then , just as now the full mooner left of the daily kos and michael moore has bought into the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy america .

1			york	new	towners	original	movie	bad	direction	tedious	lens	soft			unfortunately , this movie is so bad . the original out of towners was manic and very funny , of course they used the script written by neil simon . for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again . even the audience i was with never laughed . the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies that is , the couple having sex in the park . they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york , well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick . the whole movie winds up being like this . a joke is set up and given away . why isn not goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie . you will also notice every close up of goldie they use a very intense soft lens . i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis , that's if you want to laugh .

1			forms	cultural	approaches	different	i	wrong	beliefs	different	people	ok			unfortunately i made a mistake and i paid 7 euros at the movie theater to watch this shallow meaningless movie . my points ; film is based on 2 things ; 1 ethnical point of view as it happens on most of the american films , the writer thinks itself as an expert after learning 2 or 3 things about the asian culture . but unfortunately it is not enough . knowing kunefe and 2 names of other foods doesn not make a person understand a culture . for example shaving is the sign of clean life in asia but everyone was trying the girl to stop that . lebanese people are christian ok they got that and their cultural forms and beliefs and approaches are completely different from other arabic countries . the main difference between eastern and western culture is we don not make ethnocentrism . so we don not judge people after their first question about our life as the father figure did in all of the film . 2 sexual revolution of a girl there is nothing much to say about this . show me 10 girls which had these on their sexual awakening than i will say that i am wrong . i wrote this comment because the producers are promoting the film in the black humor genre . please watch drstrangelove and understand the meaning of black humor . a black humor has to reflect the truth and has to focus the audience to the funny parts of it . where is the truth ? where is the meaning about the movie .
1			thing	bad	type	hate	wave	new	auteurs	new	wave	french	person	rich	price	good	fil	previous	seemed	stereotypical	it	rich	songs	interesting no	seemed	bland	musical	french no			if i hadn not read his name on the dvd cover , i never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the french new wave . in fact , the film is so far from that , that i wonder if back in the 50 and 60 , new wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of film it's and , it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous fil ms this isn not necessarily a bad thing just a very surprising thing . what i also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this film especially when there are so many better french musicals out there . the songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical . if i had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit , i was going to puke . the bottom line is that like american musicals , not every french musical is gold . this film is not another les parapluies de cherbourg umbrellas of cherbourg or huit femmes eight women and despite the presence of audrey tautou , i can not see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity .
1			piece	atrocious	midnight	central	it	funny	movie	worst	movie	horrible	movie	available			anyone who has watched comedy central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie . i first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 it looked like it could be funny , but i wasn not about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie fir st i figured i would wait until the movie was available to rent at blockbuster . about a year and a half later , i was at tower records and in the dvds for less than $ 20 pile , there was a copy of this movie . seeing that the dvd was only $ 6.99 i decided to buy it . i got home , put the disc in the dvd player , and waited for the laughs to i waited some more . the laughs never came . i would have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when i say that this movie was horrible . sick , desperately tasteless , and poorly written and directed , the underground comedy movie is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time . no stars .
1			film	serious	statement	political	nothing	positive	dialogue	ridiculous	examination	serious	execution	dreadful			warning ! small plot details revealed ! i can find virtually nothing positive to say about this film . it is written so badly that every character is a caricature , yet it seems to take itself seriously . it is poorly cast , especially ralph macchio all baby faced , 5 foot nothing of him as a streetwise tough . plot elements are all drawn in black and white , with every situation almost immediately escalating to some extreme climax . most egregious of all plot element about to be revealed it has perhaps the most gratuitous and contrived nude scene in the history of semi serious film . one can just imagine the filmmakers saying , we need jobeth to shed her have got it ! early in the film , let's give nick some ridiculous dialogue about baring yourself in the jobeth can use that line on him later and really bare herself in the , that's the ticket ! i will give the producers credit for tackling a weighty subject in 1984 one that proved all too weighty in the late 90 s with events like columbine . however , the execution is dreadful . this film could have been a dark comedy in the vein of heathers , a campy political statement like network or a serious examination like brubaker . instead , it tries to be all of these things and ends up being none of these things . teachers get an
1			movie	worst	i	wrong			as a turkish man now living in sweden i must confess i often watch scandinavian movies . most if them i never understand . i think actors from scandinavia work best in hollywood . last week i watched a film called the polish wedding together with a polish friend of mine and we both said it was the worst movie we ever watched . unfortunately i was wrong this movie house of angels is even worse . none of the actors can act , absolutely not the female so called star helen bergstrom . the plot is so silly nobody can believe it . i think the whole thing is a mess from the start . lots of bad acting except from selldal and wollter . ahmed sellam
1			perversion	visual	works	visual	emperor	naked	man	old	lady	great	lady	sensitive	legitimacy	artistic	bloss	poor			yes , he is ! not because of pintilie likes to undress his actors and show publicly their privies . pintilie is the naked emperor so to speak . it's big time for someone to state the truth . this impostor is a voyeur , a brat locked in an old man's body . his abundance of nude scenes have no artistic legitimacy whatsoever . it is 100 visual perversion he gets his kicks by making the actors strip in the buff and look at their willies . and if he does this in front of the audience , he might eve get a hard on ! did you know that , on the set of niki ardelean , he used to embarrass poor coca bloss , by telling her oh , coca , how i wanna f you ! she is a great lady , very decent and sensitive , and she became unspeakably ashamed to his petty satisfaction ! and , as a worrying alarm signal about the degree of vulgarity and lack of education in romanian audiences , so many people are still so foolish to declare these visual obscenities works of art ! will anyone have ever the decency to expose the truth of it all ?
1			schaech	terrible	redemption	good	plot	weak	acting	terrible	bits	necessary	fonda	terrible	dialogue	bad	keitel	decent			i found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored . how can people possibly give this a 10 it's not just that it's supposed to be a feel good redemption film i think , because it doesn not work on that level either . weak plot , bad dialogue , terrible acting ; there's just nothing there . harvey keitel is decent , but has nothing to work with , and bridget fonda and especially johnathon schaech are just terrible . the plot progression especially the relationship between byron and ashley makes no sense . it seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it , without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow . it's only an hour and a half , but that's 90 minutes of your life you will never get back .
1			story	hopeless	plot	predictable	scene	inexplicable	everybody	pleasant no	program	awful	thing	worst			the john goodman program was pretty awful , but this thing just plain stinks . the one and only thing in this mess that made me smile was recognizing the voice of patrick starfish as frosty . the story is hopeless , written by somebody who has garbled memories of childhood rebelliousness but has never gained any adult sense of perspective in the intervening years . paranoia rules the dark world that these characters inhabit . everybody is unpleasant , and for no reason . the plot is predictable but the show lurches from one inexplicable , unconnected scene to another in such a pointless way there is no fun in watching it . the worst thing is nobody in the production crew seems to have ever seen snow !
1			beginnings	humble	success	artistic	themes	important	event	predictable	line	predictable	continuity	little	theater	good			sunshine is a european import set in hungary between 1880 and 1980 it's the epic story of hungarian jews , the sonnenschein family . this name literally translates to sunshine . the family has humble beginnings , then is prosperous , becomes upwardly mobile , changes it's name , and hopes to assimilate into hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally . the story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations ; ralph fiennes plays these three roles . for those who missed the ww ii and the holocaust in europe , the sonnenschein approach to life doesn not work out very well . sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success , but it is an opportunity missed . the story line , dominated by world history , is predictable and transparent ; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage . the family plot lurches from one predictable event ie . the hapsburgs , ww i , ww ii , fascism , communism , etc to the next with little continuity , depth or detail . the jewish assimilation theme is unfocused , and important sub themes the 'secret diary and family philosophy that could have given the family character and credibility are l ost until the very end . alternatively , the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity . ralph fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance but his performance is far from award winning material . the 3 for 1 casting format is a viewer distraction and feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater . sunshine is basically hungarian history channel material . it has the look and feel of winds of war morphed with forrest gump morphed with something about sex .
1			movies	scary	it	hard	movie	scary	budget	low	aim	bad	states	united	quality	poor			wow , i just saw this on t . v . as one of the scary movies they show around halloween . was this rated g ? there wasn not really anything to make this movie scary , or worth watching . also , other people say this is a spoof , but i don not think so . for a spoof , you need something called humor . this low budget crap fest didn not have a shred of humor , and it didn not make much sense , either . you basically have a goofy looking monster man in rubber suit coming out of closets , killing people , i guess , since you never see the monster doing violence to anyone or any bloody aftermath . the spinning newspaper tells you that people were killed by the monster , so i guess that's good enough . the military tries feebly to kill the monster , which isn not much larger than a man . they have very bad aim . then the military flees ! wow , did this movie make the the united states military look pathetic or what ? the monster , while hard to kill , doesn not do much besides shuffle around and roar . oh , and occasionally a second head pops out of its mouth and shrieks . it was a slightly interesting , yet a total alien ripoff . what was the deal with the scientist playing the xylophone to attract the monster ? it was hard to understand a lot of the dialog due to the poor sound quality . also , why did the monster carry around the main wimpy guy for so long ? why didn not the monster go into the closet when it had a chance ? why do i insist on trying to make sense out of the senseless ?
1			america	ridiculous	script	awful	it	hard	it	flat	drama	historical	script	bad	country	big	flaws	dynamic	prairies	big	one	poor			this movie was promising my favorite actor in a historical drama during the independence war . it had memories from dances with wolves for the big prairies , indians , military fights & from barry lyndon for the british & candles lights atmospheres . unfortunately , the script is awful the continuity of the story is lacking cuts with 5 months later ; 3 years later & the romance is so ridiculous that it's hard to believe in it america is a big country but the characters kept bumping at each other ; above all , wait for the ending & you understand how to kill a story imagine the same in titanic . sometimes , a bad script is saved by a brilliant filmmaker . unfortunately bis , hudson is a poor one . he has already committed greystoke and i find again the same flaws no dynamic in scenes , in editing , in scoring it is long , dull , flat . i knew that this movie was a disaster for pacino's career now i understand . finally , this last movie for 2006 is in the vein of this year for me a painful one .
1			star	charismatic	shepherd	big	shepherd	german	comedy	great	talent	good	writing	good			if you are one of the people who finds according to jim great television comedy , this is going to rock your world . and might i add , kudos for proving that good talent , good writing and a charismatic star are all you really need on any network other than abc , which prefers to air crap like jim belushi's show year after year . k -911 is a big , steaming , brown , german shepherd sized thank you for all of the geniuses who loved the first movie . it's exactly what fans of that film and the lesser belushi deserve . jim's comedic chops and choice in projects are never far behind his ability to butcher a blues standa rd look for him to try to showcase all of his diverse lacks of talent into every project he hurls at the public like a surly zoo chimpanzee . if you enjoy jim's work , this movie is your rewa rd
1			twist	poor	films	scary	idea	good			i first heard about white noise when i saw the tv advert . before then i didn not even know it existed . i watched the trailer online and decided that i would go and see it . now being a fan of films like the sixth sense , i thought that this film would give me everything i wanted . it has michael keaton in it , and he rocks . unfortunately the film did not deliver . it tried to be another sixth sense or stir of echoes , and failed miserably . it has a very promising start , but the middle just drags on repeating itself , and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out . unfortunately like most scary films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump . this film could have been so much more . it's a shame because it was a good idea .
1			they	dimensional	actors	good	films	good			i wanted to like this film , i really did . it's got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat . it tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over zealous cooking attempts , over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someone's yard , so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that , while mildly interesting , are really just filler all the work scene's . and i didn not find the villians intimidating , or worth hating , so much as i found them to be childishly annoying . i have met people like those in the film while playing church ball . and i will say the referee's are spot on , still , in the end , i really didn not care all that much about the characters , or their quest for church ball glory . maybe because they were all so one dimensional , which i might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall . kurt hale , and halestorm entertainment , has made some good films , but this is not one of them .
1			movie	original	it	good	person	sensitive	tabu	good			bridges of madison county is a better made version of this story . i felt the ending of this movie was not handled sensitively as they did in the original english movie . this movie is very indianised , if you are a very sensitive person who cries in a movie when hero dies in the end you will love this movie , on the other hand if you are a fighter in life and think crying is for wimps you may not like the on the whole it's pretty good subject is well handled for indian conditions . tabu was good as a caring wife and mother . everybody acted well .

1			film	ok	specimens	available	back	dead	innuendo	good	animals	fake	it	dull	bit	little	specimens	young	piece	watchable	overacting	serious	none	flat	object	modern	film	best	it	worst no	science	modern	i	surprised			dr hackenstein begins at the turn of last century , 1909 the dawn of modern medical science to be exact . dr eliot hackenstein david muir is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments , dr hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life . it's now not hree years later & dean slesinger micheal ensign is round the doc's house for dinner . as dean slesinger & dr hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstien's experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to , dr hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila sylvia lee baker who died in an unfortunate accident & can telepathically talk to him christy botkin provides sheila's voice apparently . dr hackenstein also show's dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage & explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life . the dean has some sort of seizure & apparently dies . meanwhile sisters wendy bambi darro as dyanne dirossario & leslie trilling catherine davis cox plus their brother alex john alexis & their cousin melanie victor stacey travis are driving along near hackenstein's house when they crash , they seek shelter & assistance & arrive upon hackenstein's doorstep . dr hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night . later on dr hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers , xavier logan ramsey & ruby rhodes ann ramsey who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila . dr hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available & starts to borrow the bits n pieces he needs to complete sheila . written & directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr hackenstein , i will state right now that it ain not brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it . it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it's middle as things settle down . the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie & she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson catherine cahn by kicking out & hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolanda's back who is seemingly oblivious to what's happening , with a touch of gore but i would say dr hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception & feel throughout . there are some tacky puns & sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh , dr hackenstein to wendy would you like to see my instruments as an example . i also thought the scene when mrs trilling phyllis diller reports her missing daughter's to the bemused detective olin william schreiner was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle's talking about why he isn not looking for them even though he has only just been told , why the cell doesn not have a prisoner in it & that if he didn not find the cousin not to worry about it . none of it's flat laugh out loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion & found the film as whole to be quietly amusing . there isn not a lot of on screen gore , a few severed limbs , sheila's decapitated head , some medical stitching & those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way . i liked the characters in dr hackenstein too , which was surprise in itself . the acting isn not brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it , lots of exaggerated facial movements & some serious overacting means it's never dull , oh & the three birds in dr hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean . technically the film is ok as well , once again it ain not going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting . it doesn not always work , the clothes are at odds with each other at times , the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western . the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room & stick a few candles in there ! it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn not a bad looking film at all considering . could have done without the comedy music though . overall i ended up enjoying dr hackenstein much more than i thought i would , although that in itself isn not a recommendation . it's certainly is not the best comedy horror film ever made & it certainly is not the worst either . a watchable enough piece of harmless fun .
1			movie	good	film	great	thing	good	cast	good	he	ok			hi , everyone , if you saw singing in the rain , you remember the scene of gene kelly dancing in the rain . you also remember the dance number of donald o connor , make em laugh . if you saw royal wedding , you will remember fred astaire dancing on the ceiling . if you saw jailhouse rock , you will even remember the title dance number choreographed by the king himself . that is what is missing here . there could have been some blockbuster dance numbers in this presentation . the closest was chuck mcgowan's i can do that . the mere fact that you have some talented people on stage moving together does not make a great dance film . richard attenborough was to blame for this failure . he pointed the camera at the stage and thought that would be a good thing . yelling at people auditioning for a part in a broadway production is not entertainment . michael douglas would be just as badly cast if he were in a western or a comedy . he is ok when he is in a michael douglas movie where we see him yelling at someone we would like to yell at . it does not work here . the cast was good except for michael , of course . a good movie could have been made even using the songs that were in the stage production , but someone should have thought about how to film it . next time they do one of these i hope they call me fir st tom willett
1			resemblance	remarkable	it	necessary no	script	inspired no			the major flaw with the film is its uninspired script . it plods back and forth between vignettes of bettie's story and re creations of the klaw short fil ms while the klaw re creations are well done , it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety . page richards , while not an amazing actress , does a decent job overall . and , at times , she does bear a remarkable resemblance to bettie . also of note is some faithful attention to detail . costumes and clothing well done , as is some of the set direction . the sets are generally sparse and feel stage y , but do feel of the era . it is sometimes surprisingly well lit , and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant , retro feel .
1			later	little	it	bad	part	interesting	soup	political	conspiracy	horrendous	conspiracies	political	coppola	true	bases	visual			this is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time . remember the all around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the watergate and a little later ? most movies trying to cash in on made for tv o so powerful , o so mind numbing conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel gazing attitude . i was never a fan of the conversation which i find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but coppola was true to his main character and hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe . i mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes . lots of questions unanswered , lots of dis communication . well this takes at least bergman to build a movie about such un visual bases . the next man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him . neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn not get any better . in fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up watcha that murders without ever advancing any storyline . pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer's eyes .
1			example	worst	thing	worst	cop	hard no			first let me say that i am not a dukes fan , but after this movie the series looked like law and order . the worst thing was the casting of roscoe and boss hogg . burt reynolds is not boss hogg , and even worse was m . c . gainey as roscoe , if they ever watched the show roscoe was not a hard ass cop . he was more a barney fife than the role he played in this movie . the movie is loaded with the usual errors , cars getting torn up , and continues like nothing happened . the worst example of this is when the the general gets together with billy prickett , and the general is ran into a dirt hill obviously slowing to a near stop , but goes on to win the race .
1			dialgoue	unbelievable	endings	predictable	coherence	limited	films	worst			a cheesy , compellingly awful and not in a fun way c grade movie . everything shouts amateur , from the crumby script bizarre premises , limited coherence and predictable endings ; the turgid lighting , sound and hand held wobbly camera angles ; the coy and passe sexual inneundo and references ; the patchy and unbelievable dialgoue to the z rate acting . i saw it on dvd and kept hoping edward wood would pop out . all is forgiven your worst films are works of art , and more coherent than this twaddle . but still , preferable to the warbling every night in my dreams i hear you are you sure the titanic crew weren not involved in this on the side ?
1			character	new	show	new	title	new	failure	complete			after the success of scooby doo , where are you , they decided to give scooby and shaggy their own show . but unfortunately , they added a new character that spoilt scooby doo success forever . they invented a new show with a new title , scooby and scrappy doo . it was scrappy doo that made this show a complete failure , probably for both adults and kids together . scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up . scooby and shaggy were getting scared of the villain , and they were also trying to stop him . scooby doo doesn not need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews . if they wanted scooby doo to be more successful , they should have either killed or never thought up scrappy . this was just poor , maybe your kids will prefer it !
1			indians	real	fan	true	league	original	indians	good			this movie is a disgrace to the major league franchise . i live in minnesota and even i can not believe they dumped cleveland . yes i realize at the time the real indians were pretty good , and the twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the american league , but still be consistent . anyway i loved the first major league , liked the second , and always looked forward to the third , when the indians would finally go all the way to the series . you can not tell me this wasn not the plan after the second film was completed . what happened ? anyways if your a true fan of the original major league do yourself a favor and don not watch this junk .
1			we	surprised	script	poor	commenters	previous	girls	old	it	nasty			watched this film having really enjoyed gregory's girl many years ago . this was drivel . the plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 14 -15 year old girls in very short skirts . previous commenters seem to think that this doesn not matter , but i found it rather nasty . if you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils . we were surprised that the censor let that through . apart from that the film was just a waste of time . the script was poor and john gordon sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image , slightly wacky and off the wall . why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible . this film failed on all counts for me . dreadful . please don not waste your time watching it . life's too short
1			ground	moral	shots	dramatic	experiment	social	it	fun			what happens when you give a homeless man $ 100 000 as if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen . the creators of reversal of fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment . they take ted , a homeless man in pasadena , and give him $ 100 000 to see if he will turn his life around . then , with only the most cursory guidance and counseling , they let him go on his merry way . what are they trying to say ? money can not buy you happiness ? the homeless are homeless because they deserve to be ? or how about , lift a man up it's more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude . they took a man with nothing to lose , gave him something to lose , and then watched him dump it all down the drain . that's supposed to be entertainment ? they dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots , but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked , what happens when you take down a stop sign ?
1			insult	inaccurate	acting	awful	movies	flat			ok . i know that the wanna be john hughes movies of the 80 were all unilaterally flat , so the expectations for this film ran pretty low . still , after sitting through this crap there's one key thing i can not seem to get out of my head i just sat through an 80 rob lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them . the acting is awful , the characters boring and flat , the portrayal of oxford an absolute insult , and the rowing scenes unexciting , uneventful , and inaccurate . unless you have got some wierd ally sheedy or amanda pays or i guess , rob lowe fetish , there's really no reason to see this one .
1			parts	hilarious	choice	best	motives	terrible	seemed	real	pieces	various	looked	silly	point	original	original	classic	flick	great			the original vanishing point was a great flick . subtle motives , characters that seemed real and remake was terrible . preachy , overtly obvious ; it missed the point as to why the original was a classic . the black charger was cool , but even that couldn not rescue this flick . why stick with a white challenger ? i didn not think that was the best choice back in 71 some parts of the film were unintentionally hilarious . like when vigo was standing on a cliff overlooking the canyon after his dream quest . his indian pal was standing next to him . vigo was only wearing his white briefs . i m sorry it just looked silly him surveying the vista in his fruit of the loo ms another scene was at the end after the explosive crash into the bulldosers the announcer said that the impact was clocked at 180 mph . then he mentions that the cops said his remains weren not found because he vaporized , but some people believe he bailed out and was hidden by friends in the crowd . then it shows him rolling out of the car at 180 mph ! first of all , you couldn not open the car door at 180 mph . secondly , the car would not continue to travel in a straight line for 100 yds . with nobody to steer it . it would promptly roll over about 30 times . thirdly , if you hit the pavement at 180 mph , you would wind up in various squishy pieces . no matter , we see him at the end standing with his daughter . all in all , a movie that would insult anyone's intelligence .

it takes just one thought . nothing changes on the outside , all the changes are within . an yet he has an erection some self proclaimed mystic , head of her own school of enlightenment . while looking at herself in the mirror i hate you ! i hate you ! you are fat ! you are ugly ! i have you ! main character , the fat and ugly photographer .

commentator steve richmond stated that a walk on the moon is , in his words not worth your $ 7 . i ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst quality dvds i have yet seen , of this film or any film in existence . even when you ignore the fact that the dvd is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion , the film has no redeeming qualities save anna's presence to make watching a top quality blu ray transfer worthwhile . not that this is any fault of the other actors . liev schreiber , diane lane , tovah feldshuh , and viggo mortensen all score high on the relative to anna paquin acting ability chart . far more so than holly hunter or sam neill did in spite of an equally lousy script , anyway . director tony goldwyn's resume is nothing to crow about , but pamela gray's resume includes wes craven's most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre , so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction . as i have indicated already , the sole reason i watched this film is anna paquin . in her acting debut , she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years experience above hers under the table . while she is not as far ahead of her castmates here , her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her oscar was no fluke . for some time i have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel , and a dialogue seventy three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why . this woman could literally act the paint off walls . anna aside , only liev schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience . sure , his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis , but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly . i should know , even if it is not from the same circumstances here . viggo mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman , although perhaps not to the same extent . in a manner of speaking , he is the villain of the piece , but he successfully gives the character a third dimension . yes , his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded , but not many men would act any differently in his situation . nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed up situation , so viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here . unfortunately , these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where tovah feldshuh tells us that the mills and boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exi st either writer pamela gray or director tony goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it . anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility . that said , the film does have a couple of things besides anna going for it . mason daring's original music , while not standing out in any way , gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not . roger ebert is right when he points out that while liev is a great actor , putting him alongside viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake . he is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of lane and mortensen skinny dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall , it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn . the film seems terminally confused about the position of its story . no matter how many times i rewatch liev's scenes , i cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing . one does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful , but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way . ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw anna on the screen , he thought her character was where the real story lay . stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen , to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as earth shattering as the moon landing will not help . in spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character's story is presented , anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes . while i am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast , it is very much as if they did not bother to try with lane and schreiber . fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere . hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong . i gave a walk on the moon a three out of ten . anna paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something .
1			advancement	real	guys	good	attempt	horrible	guy	good			considering how much money was budgeted for this film , you would expect more from the story as a whole . this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched . there was no real advancement of anything . character development , minimal . plot advancement , maybe . enjoyment , none . i m not sure what points were even trying to be made . if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys , american cia bombs everything that doesn not agree with our opinions , all capitalists are corrupt , and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death , have at . for those of us who realize that it doesn not take killing off a good guy to make a point , we will stick to other movies . in summary , this was a horrible attempt at an ocean's 11 style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what's going on , nobody who made the movie did either . home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece .
1			murder	vicious	performance	solid	endowments	infamous			val kilmer , solid performance . dylan mcdermott , solid performance . josh lucas , solid performance . three very engaging actors giving decent performances . the problem is , who cares about the plot ? john holmes . infamous for his well endowments , a drug addict , and a guy who , despite contracting aids , continued to make adult films , just does not make an intriguing character . the story surrounds the events leading up to and the aftermath of a vicious mass murder that occurred in the late 80 s in los angelos to which holmes was linked , arrested and charged with murder , and who ultimately was acquitted . just like in the case of o . j . the guilt factor , regardless of the outcome , ranged quite high in the he did it zone . there is no one to sympathize with in this film , as everyone is a self serving criminal . there is just nothing remotely interesting here .
1			script	poor			bizarre take on the cinderella tale . terribly poor script , but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step mother performance . visually stunning in some parts , but that's about it . the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990 . fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel . if you are really in the mood for a cinderella story i suggest ever after a cinderella story or the glass slipper .
1			film	worst	plot	discernible	video	heavy			i don not know where to begin . tara reid needs to be stopped before she's put in another movie . stephen dorff looks like he got his character's motivation from val kilmer in top gun . slater sleepwalks through this dreck . the direction , editing , sound do we really need a heavy metal video in the middle of a gunfight ? costumes bulletproof vests with muscles on them , and hey , there's no discernible plot either . it amazes me that no one attached to the project stopped and said , hey guys , this just doesn not make any sense , let's start over . hopefully slater's career can rebound from this disaster . hands down the worst film i have ever seen .
1			part	enjoyable	point	discernible			i went to see this movie at our college theater thirty years ago because i liked bruce dern in silent running and family plot . to this day sorry jack nicholson , it is still the dullest movie i have ever seen . it just went on and on with no discernible point and then it just ended . the lights came up and i watched everyone looking around in confusion . had the projectionist missed a reel ? i have never had the urge to find out . all i remember about the movie is that it was a non drama about some annoying college basketball players and their coach . the most enjoyable part of the movie was watching the totally mystified audience afterwords . fortunately , this was just an exception for jack , bruce , and karen black .
1			it	lucky	something	funny			i missed the beginning but i did see most of it . a friend got it on dvd in the cheap room at fye . the skits are all very short , and yet most of them are still too long . the majority of them , they seem to have forgotten to have something funny ! quite a lot of racist / sexist / homophobic humor in it , skits based on stereotypes , or skits which use racist terms for people . i m trying to remember anything i thought was funny in it , and i m having trouble . the logo for the tunnel vision network is a lipsticked mouth with an eyeball in it . the mouth opens and closes over the eye like eyelids . kind of creepy . what a disappointment . most of the actors went on to better things , and it's lucky this bomb didn not hold them back .
1			conditions	atrocious	premise	poor	perspective	musical	film	good			the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one , that is aside from the musical perspective . it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set . the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror . had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film , however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don not exactly sit well next to the songs . aside from the poor premise the acting isn not the best either , goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the ca st overall a disappointment . 3 10
1			actors	worth	plan	real	they	perfect	it	impressive	jokes	good	brother	happy no	jokes	bad			recap ron is about to marry mel . they are deeply and love and certain they are perfect for each other even though they met just a few months ago . todd , ron's brother in law to be is not so happy . he is afraid the marriage is a threat to his cushy job in the family business and decides to arrange ron's bachelor party . but his real plan is to put ron in a compromising situation , get evidence and break ron and mel up . comments supposed to be a sequel to a comedy classic but it isn not funny at all . it is mostly a pubertal show and a juvenile excuse to show scantily clad women . actually , in a way , it is almost impressive have many you can put in there , because they are everywhere . unfortunately that is also one of the signs of a movie that can not support itself . it simply isn not good enough . it has three redeeming points though , or actually three actors that is worth a better script than this . it is lead actor josh cooke who actually manages to give an impression of some common sense . sara foster i know has more talent than to do movies like this , and emanuelle vaugier seem to have a lot more talent than this movie . what is suspiciously absent are good jokes . actually , bad jokes are rather scarce too . it just isn not funny . 3 10
1			girl	young	relationships	unbelievable	reflection	true	person	young	lack	total	sentiment	popular	ilemmas	moral	seem	solid	grounds	moral	relationships	real	everyone	entire			i have watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting , considering medical facts that can be learned . but this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters . everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone , even during office hours , which is ridiculously unrealistic . there doesn not seem to be one solid , lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show everyone is broken up and on the prowl hardly a true reflection of all americans . indeed , there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome . then we are presented with endless little moral would ilemmas and they are generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn not agree with the all knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice . for instance , in one of the latest episodes we are presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we are supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on . anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid . and i think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro lifers . addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds . the general feeling was that if you opposed abortion , you are a freak hardly the popular sentiment in the us . two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets , in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression . what's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in . the script could have been written by planned parenthood . all in all , this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far fetched medical situations throughout the whole show .
1			music	outstanding	music	original	actor	great	amounts	great	chef	personal	laughter	nervous	wickerman	new	film	original	expense	great	wickerman	scary	spin	new	dialogue	powerful	make	bad	girl	old	girl	young	acting	affected			sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness . i remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re release of the excorcist really nervous laughter . it punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of satan coming out of a 12 year old girl . in the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic the wicker man however , it made me think that this new wickerman is about as scary as the south park character , scuzzlebut , the friendly forest monster with tv's patrick duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets . 3 years ago a friend of mine in hollywood told me that he heard that nicolas cage was going to do a remake of the film . i started laughing and my friend keith got mad at me touting nicolas cage as a great actor . i just didn not think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers i was right . gone is the realness , the outstanding original music , the originality , the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue . instead we have horror movie clichs , affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart . like many of the countless hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4 h graders on a playground playing wickerman . the original film takes place on a remote scottish isle where a scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named rowan morrison . in the new spin a california cop cage is lured to an island of the coast of washington state by his ex girlfriend to find her missing daughter . she sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago . the crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found . yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north , alone , to help his ex girlfriend find her daughter . he arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of wiccans , many of whom seem like they didn not get call backs for roles in the village . and like the village it isn not long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here . not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison . i think that the opportunity in hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry . i think someone like nicolas cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks . we needed a bad re make of the wickerman like we needed yet another 9 -11 movie . i m starting to wonder if nicolas changed his surname from coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so .
1			story	exciting	crossbow	unbelievable	depiction	pathetic	one	exciting	tale	true	i	disappointed	reviewer	previous	challengers	previous	english	old	english	modern	poem	original	movie	great			just once i would like to see a version of beowulf where it appears the screenwriters have at least a passing familiarity with the original poem . yet again , after watching this sci fi presentation , i m disappointed . i m not suggesting the writers need to understand and analyze the poem in old english , but i wish they could at least try to read a translation in modern english and attempt to construct a story based on what actually transpires . the story is exciting enough ; why add plot elements that are non existent and ruin the story ? what's wrong with being faithful to the text ? grendel is immune to weapons of any kind ; why introduce some super crossbow that is unbelievable and could not have possibly existed in this time period as correctly pointed out by the previous reviewer ? the fight with grendel was beowulf vs . grendel . that's it . no one else took part in the battle . the only way beowulf could have defeated him was by choosing specifically to engage the monster without any weapons , the mistake made by all previous challengers . yet , in this version , danes and geats fight the beast and beowulf hacks off grendel's arm with a sword ! again , why couldn not they portray what really happened ? personally , i think a one on one grappling match between the two would be much more exciting . overall , this is a pathetic and abysmal depiction that is faithless to the true tale . why add in a pact with hrothgar and grendel's mother that includes sacrificial offering ? why create extra characters , like finn , that add nothing to the story ? there was no love story in the poem . they couldn not even set the scenes in the appropriate locations a forest instead of the swamp and no lair under the lake . they fail to notice the metaphor that grendel's lair signifies it's supposed to be underground to represent hell . why not instead center on the symbolism inherent in the epic poem ? even my high school students last year were able to do immensely better when they created a short film based on beowulf , since they focused on the themes and symbolism underlying the story . if hollywood could create a film that centers on these elements and is faithful to the plot , then that would be a truly great movie .
1			feelings	similar	i	bored			americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial , we tend to lose interest really fa st i found out an exciting fact from this film someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule ! and guess what , they really would like to be doing something else the viewer has similar feelings . surprisingly , when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film , i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging . i just don not usually watch that much late night tv , so i can not recommend this film , unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life .
1			role	stereotypical	anthropologist	british			the problem is the role of the characters in the film . man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself . the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film two people who are kidnapped , treated like animals , and yet given such a shallow , stereotypical role within the film . the kidnapper british anthropologist ends up being the hero of the film because he manages to relate to the pygmies . no notion of how the two hostages feel , of their point of view , of their ordeal . i find it is a shallow film , with a one sided fundamentally racist view . it never manages to move away from the white mans view
1			gas	available no			after watching this on the mst 3 episode , i have to wonder how many movies this film borrows from . it seems to combine elements of logans run , farenheight 451 final sacrifice and at least several others . at one point i was really expecting cris makepease to call lee majors rowsdower . i wonder if the director has any clue how many holes there are in the plot . like the fact that , even though gas is unavailable , there is plenty of it in abandoned gas stations , and the stations are located close enough together to keep an f 1 race car going all the way across the country .

1			it	worthwhile	insanity	bad	waste	complete	saps	poor			i enjoy quality crapness , and this ranks up there with some of the fine st the cg is out of this world , or at least pre dates our world , and the insanity of a 6 foot bloke in a rat outfit chasing after people is laughably bad . i quite enjoyed some of this , but the acting is so goddamn awful , and even the obligatory nude scene doesn not really have any baps out in it . just a complete waste of time if ever i saw one . i don not know who wasted more time , me watching this , or the poor saps who got dragged into making it in the faint hope that this will launch their acting careers . i can assure you , it wont . however , on a brighter note , i have managed to successfully do the 6 degrees of kevin bacon from this movie , so i think it was almost worthwhile watching the 91 minutes of it .
1			it	hard	cult	religious			pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960 superficially hippie religious cult , who fights them sixteen years later . the man has a child with one of the other cultists , who during a raid by the police is hidden away , and taken by another man named hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river . the cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town . it's hard to keep track of who characters are , or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place . the leader gets paroled sixteen years later i got that from the box i missed the amount of time in the movie . nobody is made to look any older , not noticeably , anyway . one murder is done with a large circular logging saw , others are done with knives or a crossbow . i never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie , but he's the one who overacts the most , hooting and hollering . the movie is patched together pretty poorly , with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on . some of the sound effects were pretty bad . a man is getting punched , and we hear the sound of a whip cracking . a woman fires a gun , and we don not hear it fire , but hear a ricochet instead ! it doesn not seem to have been done for comical effect .
1			way	worst	you	sick	people	young	people	ashamed	people	british			i did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though i felt so angry at what i saw . i felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible . since i have lived in the uk i have come to love this country but this film depicts british young people in the worst way imaginable . there is nothing to be said but avoid it , it will make you angry and sick . the people involved should be ashamed .
1			movie	good	it	graphic	fan	big	movie	big			i m a big fan of nicolas cage and i never thought he would work on a movie like this . i couldn not believe the other reviews and i thought it shouldn not be bad to watch it at least trust me , it is . i haven not seen the old why would they want to remake a movie like this . the very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic . this film doesn not fall under any of those and just remains dumb . i just kept watching the movie hoping it would get interesting at some point , but it never does . so this movie is a big no no for both horror movie fans as well as for the cage fans . you could probably for it show up on television .

does nothing to enlighten a potential viewer on its merits and downsides , nor does it often give reasoning as to why a movie is so good , which should be the point of the review in the first place . with that being said , war of the worlds is nothing more than a hurried , incompetent attempt at a money grab ; piggy backing its loathsome carcass on the multi million dollar advertising campaign of the film of the same name directed by steven spielberg . many people will buy this dvd in anticipation of the summer blockbuster and many more poor souls will buy it looking for more material on the same subject . this movie is not even so bad that it becomes funny or endearing , rather the audience will be so unbelievably disappointed as to reach the point of anger . now with most of the insults out of the way , allow me to give some arguments as a warning to those more fortunate than judging from the cover and the lack of any publicity for this film i found it as sam's club for 8 bucks , i assumed that the cast would be no names and that the special effects would be nothing too spectacular . check . this is not a big deal for me , as i find a large budget and an over reliance on big name stars and se can diminish an otherwise decent movie . i also did not expect to be blown away by great dialog or a moving score . check again . what i did hope for was an actual serious attempt at a classic theme and a few alien / battle scenes . now , as per imdb's policy any spoilers must be announced in advance , no matter how small , so here is fair warning . the movie opens with a lot of inane small talk , followed by a trip to an observatory to look at a red dot . seriously , it is a pictures of a red dot in a tube . it is very hard to describe every little issue in depth , but by the end of the first ten minutes , the combination of shaky camera work , spliced scenes , and a lot of walking begin to frustrate the viewer . however , the costuming is surprisingly not bad and the hope that the pods will reveal something mysterious keeps you going . the next 30 minutes basically go as follows one of the main characters walks to one of the pods , he looks at the pods and talks to another main character about looking at the pod and it may be hot . they both walk back to town . these walks aren not two seconds or added so that dialog may be exchanged . they are twenty seconds or more and are there simply to add filler to an already bloated three hour movie . in a particularly grueling scene , the main character is shown looking at a pod , then he is shown pacing and panting , then he looks at the pod , then he takes a one minute walk through a field to town , then comes in to town and walks into a building , then he has a cup of coffee and says thank you mary to a random maid that serves him coffee , then he puts down the coffee and walks out the building , then he walks a minutes through the field and back to the pod . i apologize for the extreme run on sentence , but it is perhaps the best way to summarize this entire film . characters speak way too long about mundane things , they walk a lot , they send other people to walk , the camera fluctuates between high speed and slow speed , but for no dramatic effect , simply the camera man is a sophomore at tech somewhere . the editing is mind bogglingly bad . people actions make little sense . for instance , when the professor goes to a farmer's house and says that he needs the farmer to give him a ride to town , the farmer stutters and paces around . when the professor says that there is a pod and that men might be trapped inside , the farmer locks him in a shed only to see the professor grab a pitchfork and open the weak shed a second later . nothing of any consequence of course comes from this entire scene , as the professor runs into the main character a moment later so they can begin their afternoon walk . the entire film feels as if someone at one point had a good idea about making a film , but absolutely no idea how to put that in motion . i have seen better high school video productions . finally , the special effects are laughable and do nothing to advance the story . i get the feeling that the director really wanted this film to become somewhat of a cult classic of campy garbage . however , it is so awful in technical aspects , and in sheer common sense that it only makes people mad . avoid this film at all costs .
1			yorker	new	interference	constant	yorker	obsessive	william	colorful	i	stupid	mikes	visible	credibility	creative			what noise fails to do is get us to understand its character . tim robbins plays an obsessive new yorker who can not deal with the obtrusive noises of the city any longer , particularly car alar ms it's an odd idea for a film , which has about as much creative credibility as death wish . it is clever at points ; particularly a scene in which our hero is trying to read through hagel , i m too stupid to be understanding this . he reads and rereads a paragraph in confusion , we read it and don not get it then a car alarm goes off . throughout the movie is constant interference of alarms and city noises . though , all in all it does little to help us understand our hero , who allows this all to ruin his marriage and gets distracted with side plots instead of digging deeper into his persona . the film making itself is too oblivious to notice its own sound problems , shoddy editing , and visible boom mikes . no , noise isn not all bad . william hurt is at least colorful . at least the ending doesn not fall flat . overall it drives home a logistical point , one you haven not probably thought of . at least i hadn not . though all in all , ninety minutes long , it couldn not have ended sooner . the story dragged on and seemed to be lost as soon as it started . this is another one of those movies that you might see at a film festival , but probably won not get picked up for distribution . check it out on dvd if you are really partial to someone involved in the project . otherwise skip it .
1			name	lame	parts	enjoyable	acting	poor	girl	foreign	group	worst	features	special	area	southern	line	original no	line	stupid	part	worst	he	athletic	he	bored	lord	good	movie	worst	kids	special	story	original	tool	athletic	dialogue	worst	bear	big			this movie was probably the worst movie i have ever seen . here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 the woods were more like hills in los angeles with a couple trees and brush . not scary whatsoever . news flash , if you are filming in the southern california area , big bear is only an hour away . they actually have trees there . 2 the writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue i have ever experienced . every possible line in the movie was unoriginal , clich , or just plain stupid . for instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame , the name of the clown is the killer clown lame . what is a clown doing in a forest anyway ? was that the only mask they could find ? 3 the last but certainly the least was the acting . absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled . a virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting . worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph . it's a really long scene and i guess she was supposed to be sexy , but she was not . also , and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me , was this tool who is supposed to be athletic . for instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them . then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run , that he is quite far from athletic . oh and to the girl who played kat , good lord stop singing . that song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself . if for some reason you do see this movie , i would at least recommend watching the special features . the group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story . in fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending . apparently she hangs out with special kids .
1			felt	sorry	lessons	new	he	confused			quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well . what is it ? what is it about will smith that i just can not stand any longer ? i guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an oscar . i understand how bias this is , but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons i can not ever see him winning one . he's a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor . he's just not . i give him credit for trying so hard , and being able to cry at the drop of a hat . that's about it . seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me , right from the start . the suicide 911 call didn not intrigue me in any way . i wasn not curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide . there were absolutely no surprises . the best i can say is that will smith and rosario dawson had some decent on screen chemistry . also , i don not know her name , but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife . woody harrelson had very limited screen time , but i would say he stole the show whenever he was on . all in all , just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot . i couldn not help asking myself the whole way through why i cared about any of these people . never once felt sorry for not im / ben . he killed himself with a jellyfish ? was the only survivor in an 8 person accident ? not see any of that coming . 5 10 is pretty generous .
1			truck	new	weaklings	horrible	things	good	life	safe	stuff	good	all	enjoyable			as a youth pastor i heard good things about this movie . then i watched it . the acting wasn not the be st that's forgivable . it's the message that's not give jesus your life and everything will change you will tackle better , make amazing catches , stop fumbling , start making touchdown passes , and even make the playoffs . all because jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into all american athletes . i laughed out loud when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals . but wait , that's not all . you will get a brand new truck , a $ 6000 raise , and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy twice . then you will win the state championship because god helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before and into the wind , no less all because god wanted him to make it . then you will win the state championship again the next year . none of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn not chosen to follow jesus will all their hearts . here's what i took away from the movie god can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it and it's all about making our lives better , easier , and more enjoyable . he chooses his favorite team and helps them win games . which bible is this story based on ? i will bet saint stephen wished he would known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death . someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following jesus . it would have saved them all a lot of trouble .
1			it	dull			this might be unbelievable , but this movie has grossed $ 878 138 in russia ! it's shown in almost all cinema theaters and still running ! well , i have no idea why distributors put their eye on this particular uh movie , which had almost no screening around the world . that's some kind of enigma ! haha ! maybe it was based on the fact that another movie , pledge this with paris hilton , which was as well released only dvd almost everywhere , had major screenings in russia and grossed more than 1 ln$ . besides , both movies had a lot of promotion , like there were the banners all over the city , tv commercials and etc speaking about movie , i would say it's dull and absolutely boring . it could be better , really . even if it has jessica simpson .
1			films	fast	name	good	it	bad			when my own child is begging me to leave the opening show of this film , i know it is bad . i wanted to claw my eyes out . i wanted to reach through the screen and slap mike myers for sacrificing the last shred of dignity he had . this is one of the few films in my life i have watched and immediately wished to unwatch , if only it were possible . the other films being not roll 2 and fast and furious , both which are better than this crap in the hat . i may drink myself to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget i ever witnessed this blasphemy on the good seuss name . to mike myers , i say stick with austin or even resurrect waynes world . just because it worked for jim carrey , doesn not mean seuss is a success for all canadians .
1			NULL_ITEM	NULL_ITEM			four porn stars romping through the irish woods sounds like a film to watch . we have ginger lynn allen , chasey lain , taylor hayes , and jenna jameson all together in one film . are you licking your lips ? well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victi ms yes , there was some flesh exposed far too little considering the cast but , it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures . there was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before , and more than one person lost their head in the situation . unfortunately , director christian viel did not show much promise and i am not likely to watch his later efforts .
1			part	best	max	little	parts	dramatic	kids	little			i was in second grade , 12 years ago . i remember it clearly . we were learning about space . all little kids want to go to space , right ? well , after i saw this , i was so scared to death that i would accidentally get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind . i had no idea that this was a movie . i thought it was some news program or something . i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program war of the worlds . so , recently , i get this movie again to watch , realizing my favorite actor , joaquin phoenix was in it then known as leaf phoenix . i can tell you , i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting . i mean , when andy is in space , she moves in slow motion , did you ever notice that ? i don not think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow . the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank , and begins to float backwards as the security doors close . little max is trying to pull her in . suddenly , we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts in slow motion whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg ? ! i had no idea .
1			film	fun	reasons	financial	promise	great	mess	nonsensical	sequences	best			here's an indie film i really wanted to like , but ultimately could not . the lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture . the story is a nonsensical mess that isn not worth trying to figure out . i quickly became bored within 10 minutes , then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end . even that wasn not worth the extra effort . ozark savage clearly tries too hard to be clever , lifting its best sequences from evil dead 2 and the matrix . as a result , there's very little in ozark savage that hasn not been done before , and better . this film would have been much more fun as a 10 -20 minute short , but as a feature , it just feels padded and forced . of course , there's no money in shorts , so i completely understand the financial reasons that i assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes . director matt steinauer shows great promise , and i wish him luck .
1			offensive	least	folks	good	specialty	academic			good folks , i stumbled on this film on evening while i was grading papers . my academic specialty is anglo saxon literature , and i can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves . the icelandic beowulf and grendel is the least offensive i have seen , and i did pay $ 3.00 for my copy . this sci fi version ranks with the christopher lambert version . yuck . what didn not i like ? cgi for one . amazingly bad . more importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline , not to mention the stilted acting . i am used to both with all the versions i have seen . delighted regardless , peter
1			movies	worst	boy	young	grandpa	old	slapdash	real			it's been a looooonnnggg time since i saw this comedy , and i would forgotten just how idiotic it is . i would place this easily in the lower two or three of elvis presley's very worst movies . presley plays joe whitecloud , a half breed indian bull rider who returns home to arizona and the broken down shack where his family lives , and where his friends love to party all night long . his parents are played by burgess meredith and katy jurado , and his old indian grandpa is thomas gomez . none of the three offer anything of substance , comically or otherwise . the government has invested in the family's cattle , but they are lacking a bull . elvis gets to sing just a few utterly worthless songs , and is pursued by a young boy crazy gal and her gun toting mother . this is just a real slapdash of a mess , and the dilapidated surroundings practically stink of manure and don not make this much easier . the one thing that puzzles me , however , is that elvis actually seems to be having a good time in the film . hard to believe , considering he got so upset about being stuck making so many mediocre movies .
1			film	inept	lighting	horrid	it	contrived	film	original	feels	real	she	useless	acting	hideous			i don not know what some of you are smoking , but i suspect it's potent . to call swept away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness . the acting is hideous and i m not picking on madonna here , we all know she's useless , but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious . my back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines . the editing is so sloppy , it beggars description . the photography and composition which in this era , competence should be a given for any film with a budget are astonishingly inept , even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking . these are basic elements of filmmaking , if you can not get them right , you should seek another line of work . it's as contrived as a grade 3 production of snow white , except nowhere near as well made or interesting . the original film by lina wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor , superbly acted and written , featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair . the sexual tension feels real and immediate . those of you who found guy ritchie's version deplorable , should see it , it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema . those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined .
1			horse	original	it	bad			caught this by accident on a t . v . showing and could hardly believe how utterly awful the whole experience was . by comparison , the original a man called horse was spell binding because it held one's interest throughout . but this piece of nonsense words fail me . it was bad enough to have some kind of a story presented with all the impact of a wet loaf of bread , but that error was compounded by the obvious lack of subtitles throughout whenever the so called sioux spoke . for goodness sake , couldn not the film makers have found enough north american indians who were also actors and near actors to perform as indians in this farrago instead of the imposters they actually used ? i also found it quite embarrassing watching richard harris cavorting all around the countryside at the obvious behest of the director standing just behind camera , telling him to run and jump from pointless point a to pointless point b just to make up film footage and minutes . absolutely terrible in all respects !
1			needs	special	movie	new	films	best			it's been said several times not least by me that watching an eric rohmer film is like watching paint dry ; it seems that monsieur rohmer resents this he doesn not deny it , but then how could he , he just resents it so much so that his new movie , which may also be his last , inch allah , is set so far back in time that it's like watching woad dry . those wonderful people who gave you the nouvelle vague , cahiers du cinema have already named it one of the best films of 2007 so that should give you some idea . reality is not high on rohmer's agenda so that in 5 h century france we have at one extreme a chteau that would not be out of place in the loire valley whilst the only other dwelling we see is a rude wooden hut . the story involves nymphs and shepherds and as he often does rohmer has cast it with unknowns who just happened to be passing so that the overall effect is that the annual class play at a school for special needs pupils was captured on film by accident . one is almost tempted to say come back godard , all is forgiven but even this woeful production can not make me utter those words .
1			states	united	she	quiet			i am a huge jane austen fan and i ordered the movie from just so i could see it without waiting forever for it to come to the the united states i really should have saved my money . what is with anne running after wentworth ? the whole point of anne elliot's character is that she was quiet and refined . she is not impulsive and vulgar . and mary , was she suffering from a stroke or something ? her speech wasn not normal , nor was her walking normal . there was no chemistry between the two main characters which made their whole romance completely unbelievable . in the final scene they even have sally hawkins wearing the same dress amanda root wore during the letter scene . the same clothes do not make it the same movie . in my opinion they didn not watch the 1995 version , which even though it had it's flaws , it did stay pretty close to the book . the book , i don not even think they read it . this is kind of like a cliff's notes movie of persuasion . hit on all the high points without explaining anything .
1			characters	predictable	fury	good	opinion	low	humor	little	plot	predictable	moments	dramatic	movie	bad	it	worthy	characters	popular	they	entertaining	villain	powerful	ending	predictable			i would like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan with a few notable exceptions , and i generally have a low opinion of so called otakus , as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky haired , big eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors , such as the plot . and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash , fatal fury the motion picture . as seen through the glassy , witless eyes of an otaku , there's little to find fault with in fatal fury there's plenty of quirky japanese y humor , one on one duels , some dramatic moments , and everything is beautifully drawn . but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched , predictable plot with cliched , predictable characters , culminating in a cliched , predictable ending . the love scenes are hilariously overblown the scene in which sulia heals terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment , but it's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it . and of course , fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t&a this is supplied gratuitously by the huge breasted mai shiranui . and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name oh boy , we are treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on , only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point . this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle , in which all the main characters engage the all powerful main villain in one on one combat in turn . that's some thing that's always amused me . even when battles in animes aren not taking place in a tournament , they always happen as if they were , regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever ! otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons , and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury . so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn not an anime ? the answer is an emphatic no all of this movie's charm , what little of it there is , resides in the actual drawings . had fatal fury not been an anime , it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000 if the show was still on the air . that's the key this is nothing more than a laughably bad b movie in the guise of an anime epic . if you are a fan of movies so bad that they are actually entertaining , consider renting fatal fury or catch it on the sci fi channel , as it is definitely one of those . if you are an otaku , please wake up and realize that a good 90 of the stuff you are watching is garbage . as for everyone else , buy a dreamcast and fatal fury mark of the wolves , but don not even consider seeing this movie .
1			girl	popular	dcom	worst	it	stupid	movie	fake	everything	unbelievable	acting	horrible	casting	horrible	role	serious	movie	great			wow . this was probably the worst dcom ever . i watched the first half hour and i laughed . brenda song plays wendy , the popular girl with the hot jock boyfriend and stuck up friends who is determined to be homecoming queen . she is supposed to save the world as a warrior , and shin comes to her aid to help her with her martial arts . shin teaches her the skills of a snake , tiger , etc and she has to learn certain techniques to save the world . this movie is great for kids who want to learn about martial arts and the chinese culture but the acting and casting was horrible . brenda song is a comedic actress and i can not see her playing a serious role . it was laugh out loud funny watching her cry over shin . shin couldn not act at all , and everything was totally unbelievable . i watched this movie and tried to think of something similar , and the thing i came up with was the power rangers . this movie is so fake and the stunts were so power ranger esquire that it was just corny and stupid . the characters weren not likable and i just couldn not stand to watch it . disney really needs to take time to make some decent movies . high school musical is the only movie that deserves to be on disney channel , along with other movies like jumping ship , color of friendship , go figure , read it and weep , & stuck in the suburbs . if you like action adventure and corny jokes , you will like this movie .
1			skits	political	vocals	fascinating	it	worth	theater	political	polemic	close			jean luc godard's marxist polemic is as close to unwatchable a film as you are likely to see from an internationally respected filmmaker . bits of political theater , mind numbingly boring and interminable , are interspersed with the making of sympathy for the devil , featuring the rolling stones in the studio . the process of the song's development , from mick jagger playing a demo on acoustic guitar , to the backing vocals being recorded towards the end , is fascinating , and it's worth renting this film just to see the bits with the stones . almost half the movie is devoted to this , so thanks to the miracle of chapter stops , you can skip all the bizarre political skits and just watch the stones put a song together . when i had this on laserdisc , i valiantly attempted to watch it all , but i don not see how anyone could get through it . i finally gave up and just chapter skipped my way to the stones segments .

1			movie	weak	dialogue	bad	delivery	wooden	looks	nice			semana santa or angel of death is a very weak movie . mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people . mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time . couldn not she just speak english ? all the other characters have a forced mexican english accent which is distracting . the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden . the cinematography looks nice , but that's not enough to save this tripe . this next part of this review does contain spoilers ! ! during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away , but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing . that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever . avoid !
1			it	disturbing no	meaning	new			curiosity led me to this masterpiece . unfortunately , i didn not rent it , i bought it ! the most disturbing thing about this film is that it's not so disturbing . for reasons known only to them , the makers of this film set out to show the human side of jeffry dahmer . are you kidding me ? the man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good ! and with all the flash backs and flash forwards i had trouble following the story . all in all jeremy renner's performance wasn not too bad . you can catch him in s . w . a . t . in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop . anyway , i would rate this as a 1 10 it only got a 1 because of renner's so so performance . there are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering dahmer's crimes . avoid this one .
1			it	embarrassing	animation	awful	dialog	terrible	it	sad	cartoon	classic	image	true	cartoon	painful			when this cartoon first aired i was under the impression that it would be at least half way descent , boy was i wrong . i must admit watching this cartoon is almost as painful as watching batman and robin with george clooney all those years ago . i watched a few episodes and two of them had batman literally get his ass kicked left and right by the penguin who fought like jet li and beat the crap out of batman and i watched another episode where batman got his butt kicked again by the joker , who apparently was using jackie chan moves while flipping in the air like a ninja . since when were the joker or the penguin ever a match for batman ? and worse yet when were joker and penguin kung fu counterparts of jackie chan and jet li . it's truly embarrassing , depressing and sad the way the image of batman is portrayed in this show . the animation is awful and the dialog is terrible . being a batman fan since my boyhood i can honestly and strongly advise you to stay away and avoid this show at all cost , because it doesn not project the true image of batman . this cartoon is more like a wannabe kung fu flick and if you really wanna see a classic batman cartoon i strongly recommend batman the animated series , but this cartoon is nothing more than a piece of s t ! get batman the animates series and don not waste your time with this cartoon .
1			thing	ridiculous	me	long	movie	meaningless			i don not like sean penn's directing very much , and this early work , the indian runner , is no exception . the movie has no core , it's colored with a kind of redneck , anti authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn's work , his latest work even more so than the earlier . frank miller , robert rodriguez , clint eastwood , sean penn , the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product , ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty , but ending up being , for the most part , glorified pro wrestling matches , and moralistic , almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell's angels greetings , and make me long for the days of deliverance , which is a fine movie . viggo mortensen's acting is much , much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg , and that's about it . the movie is dead meaningless , and seems to be an exercise , a series of techniques , more than a story . kudos for charles bronson , however , who proves he can act . and i wanted more of sandy dennis character . a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap .
1			name	terrible	band	naked	musicians	terrible	actors	terrible	tweens	talented no	voice	horrible	director	crappy			that's right , you heard me this movie is a freaking abomination . first off , the band , who the hell is going to go see or listen to a band called the naked brothers band ? ! not only is the name terrible but so are the musicians , they can not even play anything ! also , the lead singer sounds more girly than geddy lee , and even more his voice is horrible ! not only are they terrible musicians but they are terrible actors . led by a crappy director and thin plot , this has got to be the dumbest movie ever . i wish this website would let you use a vote of zero or below out of 10 because giving this filth a 1 10 is being way too generous . i m not sure that you can call this a comedy film . if you are looking for comedy with music , go to that weird al yankovic guy cause he does it a whole lot better than these untalented tweens .
1			relatives	talented no	man	old	competition	stupid	jim	terrible	turkey	big	cartoon	charming	movie	irritating	humor	low	thought	rational			ron howard directed this ? the 1966 cartoon is charming , teaching a simple lesson to children using a simple plot . in this movie , howard gives us a whoville filled with greedy , manipulative , self centered whos . jim carrey is terrible , but i m sure it's not his fault ; i imagine the script called for the nastiest person imaginable , so carrey channeled tom green and the result is movie magic . much like danny devito's penguin in batman returns , carrey's grinch is so thoroughly unlikeable that any degree of comedy that might be mined from his character simply evaporates . where the 1966 cartoon featured a grinch that we could all identify with , carrey's grinch is that angry , soulless old man that we have all seen at one time or another , sitting in a parked car muttering to himself or tripping toddlers at the supermarket with his cane . this grinch is thoroughly bereft of any degree of humanity , humor , or insight whatsoever , and his redemption at the end of the movie rings false . the whole movie rings false there is some stupid christmas lighting competition , a failed attempt at explaining why the grinch is such a jerk by digging into his childhood , and an indecipherable mystery as to why some of the whos have that weird lip extension and some of them don not . contrary to the 1966 cartoon , i would imagine children would find this movie tiresome , irritating , and filled with contradictory messages . did we really need to see slutty smurf , aka christine baranski as martha may whovier ? in addition , ron howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives . throw in the requisite butt jokes , fart jokes , sex jokes , and other obligatory carreyesque low brow humor , and you have a movie that is about as far from the 1966 cartoon or book that inspired it as george bush is from rational , lucid thought . thumbs down on this big fat turkey .
1			one	hard	states	united	horrors	international	way	impressed			the one sheets and newspaper campaign suggested as often they did a far more lurid and violent piece than showed up on the drive in screens . claude brook is actually an americanization of claudio brook , who worked in films for years . this one's quite hard to find anymore ; i would love to see it again to compare it to other international horrors of the day , but don not remember particularly impressed way back when . chances are it was a chopped up version that made it to the united states theatres and video . but oh , that one sheet . still a gem of my later horror collection .
1			movie	concerned	event	real	everyone	concerned	scene	laughable	idea	great	commentary	social	rhetoric	constant	kids	smart	depiction	false	flaw	serious no			unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event , but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened . the constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame i get the impression ben coccio is an avid gamer , or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning all their cd's , talk about subtlety ! but the movie only gets away with it because its fiction . nice try . yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence , but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media ? or video games ? we dont , and we wont with this movie because once again these kids are smart enough to completely relinquish the media , yet dumb enough to scorch a nazi symbol on the ground ? haha i somehow dont think so . the movie bats you over the head with its portrayal of the normalcy of the families , its almost doing a disservice to think that there wasn not a serious flaw in the family dynamic of kids that have actually gone out and shot their fellow schoolmates . why is everyone so concerned with making killers seem normal , when they are so obviously not ? a completely false and phony depiction .
1			it	funny	it	bad	thing	difficult	feature	worst	trash	stereotypical	aspect	positive			the most difficult thing about this movie is to say anything positive about it . the characters were stereotypical white trash , the movie's plot was stunted from the beginning , and the worst feature of this movie was that the nudity was so blatantly from body doubles it was funny . regretfully , that was the only funny thing in the movie . ms jenkins would be better served if in the future , she would refrain from using her life story to entertain people . it was simply that bad . the one positive aspect of this movie this has nothing to do with the lack of quality of the film is that my brother shelled out the money for this stinker .
1			expectations	real	it	bad	snow	dead	i	glad	zombie	hilarious			i had no real expectations going into this movie and i m glad . even if i had expected it to be bad i would have been disappointed . where to start ? first , i think 15 of the movie consisted of stock footage of stationary scarecrows in a dark jungle field . i get it . there's scarecrows . i think the title scarecrows was sufficient . second , not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences . there's too many times where i was left going wtf ? third , the movie takes itself seriously . i m all for a b movie with buckets of blood , screaming women , and senseless violence that is the result of a simple psychopath or ancient curse . but those movies often know they are b movies and even flaunt it , like dead snow hilarious scandanavian zombie flick or evil dead 2 but this movie seems oblivious to its crapdom . finally , there should of been more blood and / or nudity . yea , i said it . if you are going to have a crap horror movie , make with the killing . and if you are going to have one hot and one semi hot girl , one of them needs to show some side boob at a minimum . so , like the summary says , skip scarecrows and just poke yourself in the eye . you will thank me .

1			spoilers	decent			quite unimpressive . the not wists are all pretty predictable , if you have seen any movies within the last ten years , and the few somewhat interesting parts wherein someone utilizes context clues to make a decision are few and lack much punch , since the 'secret has already been shown before these clues are explained . spoilers , sorta the acting is decent enough . the story simply isn not very interesting . the whole 'still awake premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff not kidding . the surgery scene is initially tense , a bit discomforting , but then becomes utterly banal . not horrible , but not memorable . terrence howard's least interesting role to date , so far as i have seen . kind of boring , overall .
1			it	good	it	bad no	depths	new	it	bad			how , in the name of all that's holy , did this film ever get distribution ? it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths . they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie . and that's all they do . there is no plot , no tension , no characters , and not a lot of acting . just screaming and more screaming . i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast wound through it to see if anything happened . it doesn not except for screaming , of course . odlly enough , the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem there is no camera work to speak of . every shot looks like every other shot middle distance , one angle , dull , dull , dull . it's not so bad it's good . it's just plain bad .

1			fisher	talented	part	violent	movie	unique	plot	ok	fisher	awesome			ok this movie was really unique shall we say . carrie fisher was by far the most talented in the movie , even though it is said she had a coke problem during the movie . but she said that she can not remember to much of it . well thats her excuse but whats everyone else's ? ? i can not imagine they all had a coke problem . whatever it wasn not all that bad i mean i guess the plot was ok and it had some pretty funny moments . although the part where the guy gets that thing shoved in his head was a little too violent for my taste . oh well i guess i was disappointed cause carrie fisher is like so awesome and this movie did nothing for her .
1			heroine	good	film	legendary	girl	new	mountain	creepy	move	great	girl	little	it	compelling	chance	good	way	important	look	uncanny			okay , what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now ? the witches mountain has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet , at the same time , it's also strangely compelling . there's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with , but somehow i couldn not turn it off . the scratching your head with confusion starts right away , with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat . so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces ? heck no , because after this intro , the girl and her wickedness simply aren not mentioned anymore . then cut to a guy , with the most impressively trimmed mustache you will ever see , who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way . when she asks him to spend his vacation with her , he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment ! great move . the movie finally starts now , as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks . though not before he picks up a new girl patty shepard and photographs her topless ! throughout their journey , all kind of strange events occur that you guessed it are never explained . the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest , loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep ! really , car jacking witches ? apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers . that's as close as i get describing the plot , but there's a good chance i m way off more important here is the atmosphere ! the witches mountain is occasionally very creepy , with its spooky music and interesting cinematography . the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine . this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary , if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay .

1			city	big	cop	local	artist	comic	movie	entire	you	disappointed	guy	good			there is an awful lot wrong with this picture , beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant . courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city . she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged craig sheffer , and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation . d . b . sweeny is a local cop , who is supposedly there to protect and serve . meanwhile , the script manipulates the audience as to who's really the good guy ? logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns , and there are more unanswered questions than there should be . if you think blue desert might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall , you will be disappointed . his part is insignificant , just like the entire movie . merk

1			centre	moral	murderer	devious	changes	good	it	crap			not he curse of frankenstein sticks faithfully to mary shelley's story for one word of the title , which wouldn not be so bad if the changes were any good at all . the tragedy of the creature destroying frankenstein's family has been completely excised and replaced with . nothing . the heart and moral centre of the story is gone . it doesn not help that this frankenstein is a conniving , devious murderer ; he deserves everything he gets . the plot is basically a shallow checklist of frankenstein clichs . even taken on its own terms , this is rubbish a bland , rambling film featuring a shite looking creature with a pudding bowl haircut . as it's the first of hammer's horror films , directed by terence fisher and starring peter cushing and christopher lee , its place in horror history is secure . but it's crap .

1			movie	horrible no	characters	annoying	town	little	effects	special	heroes	stereotypical	characters	unsympathetic			this movie is not as horrible as most sci fi channel movies . i am used to seeing the gray cgi blobs and the amateurish special effects such as close ups of fake blood that make it very obvious that the blood is strawberry syrup or some other syrup variation . however , i had thought that i had seen all the possible lows that the sci fi channel could hit . then i saw this movie . imagine a hand inside a rubberized sock that is glazed with syrup ? those are the main alien vampires in this movie . you can clearly see the fingers inside the rubbery sock puppets . a talking hand comes out of the guts of victims , and the vampire who is on the vampire hunter's team can talk to these rubber sock puppets in transylvanian . how did alien vampires learn transylvanian ? and isn not transylvania in romania ? so shouldn not they be talking romanian ? why would some little town have their own language ? if you can suspend your gag reflex and get past the talking rubber socks with the fingers clearly moving inside the aliens heads ; then you have to deal with the other alien vampires . there are the leatherfaces who like to wear the faces of their victi ms then there are the just plain ugly ones that all seem to have a lot of facial scars . then there are the annoying valley girls and their boyfriends who are human traitors and sneak into space colonies so that they can sabotage the defense systems so that these space vampires can attack . finally , if you think all of the above is funny and worth a laugh , you have to deal with the third rate cast of network tv rejects that make up this team of stereotypical angry heroes which are constantly fighting among themselves . why does almost every sci fi channel movie have to use lead characters that are annoying , abrasive , crude , or just totally unsympathetic ? i found myself hoping the talking rubber socks would win .
1			point	strong	hudson	young	it	fun	eyes	demonic	shot	single	cops	local	dolemite	original	joy	real	dolemite	old	reason	good	place	special			i have seen dolemite and also avenging disco godfather , two other fine works of the blaxploitation canon from our friend rudy ray moore . but this film , the human tornado aka dolemite 2 will always hold a special place in my heart . for sheer goofiness , lack of skill in film production , and absolute enthusiasm frankly a little too much , the human tornado cannot be topped . the opening scene sets the tone . our old pal dolemite is shacking up with a white woman , when some racist local cops raid the house for no good reason , and wouldn not you know it ! the woman in bed with ol dole is none other than the sheriff's wife . her cry when she sees him he made me do it ! dolemite's cry &$ @$ are you for real ? ? subtlety was never his strong point . highlights ? the cameo by a very young ernie hudson of ghostbusters fame , the continuity errors characters looking one way in one shot , and another in the next , dolemite's suit changing colors in every single shot of his nightclub act , and queen bee's demonic eyes in her first scene . but the real joy here is rudy ray moore himself . did the man really think he looked cool in this movie ? i certainly don not know why , but you have to admire the sheer enthusiasm he has . whether it be jumping totally naked off a cliff , or barking orders to his gang in rhyme e . g quick ! into the cave ! i have a plan to let that mother $ @ & dig his own grave ! the man commits totally . certainly he goes overboard , nevermore so than any time he's doing kung fu . the climactic battle is filmed at high speed , but occassionaly slows down to let rudy pose and grits his teeth . i m not sure if they wanted it too look like they sped up the film as an effect or if they really wanted us to believe he was that fa st in any event , the matrix it is not . human tornado , much like the original dolemite , is an incompetent film of enormous proportions . but at least it's fun , and certainly you have to give credit to these people for the effort . just not that much . enjoy with my hearty recommendations .
1			direction	similar	development	poor	casting	good			i read the book celestine prophecy and was looking forward to seeing the movie . be advised that the movie is loosely based on the book . many of the book's most interesting points do not even come out in the movie . it is a b movie at be st many events , characters , how the character interact and meet in the book are simply changed or do not occur . the flow of events that in the book are very smooth , are choppy and fed to the view as though you a child . the character development is very poor . personnallities of the characters differ from those in the book . the direction is similar to a b horror flick . i understand that it would take six hours in film to present all that is in the book , but they screen play base missed many points . the casting was very good .
1			status	social	extravaganza	potential	looks	good	boy	poor	actors	big	girl	rich			the potential movie extravaganza , set during the 19 h century , failed to produce . with big name actors like maggie smith , albert finney , and many others , there was no reason for the movie to fail . however , the movie lacked an ending , had a sorry excuse for a plot line , and fell to pieces with its continuity . a typical story of a rich girl and a poor boy , brought together by love and destroyed by beauty or lack thereof and disapproval , has a touching side of a mother's early death and an absentee father . the father , played by finney , is a disturbed man , tormenting his daughter in life as well as death . he believes his daughter's lack of good looks would ruin his fortune by marrying beneath their social status . the actors vainly attempted to salvage what was left of the storyline . washington square is a black hole of ruin and destruction , wasting precious time of those who sorrowfully watch . i give this movie a 1 instead of a 0 purely for the actors attempts . save yourself , stay clear of washington square .

1			we	glad	acting	real	pilot	well	copies	bad	script	dull	show	great	guy	bad	willingham	noble	excuse	poor	characters	memorable	soldier	former	comedy	controversial	heart	little	smith	involved	scene	memorable			to review this movie , i without any doubt would have to quote that memorable scene in tarantino's pulp fiction 1994 when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living . jules tells vincent that the only thing she did worthwhile was pilot . vincent asks what the hell is a pilot ? and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is well , the way they make shows is , they make one show . that show's called a pilot . then they show that show to the people who make shows , and on the strength of that one show they decide if they are going to make more shows . some pilots get picked and become television progra ms some don not , become nothing . she starred in one of the ones that became nothing . now to stretch on what jules was talking about , there are billions of television shows / pilots that were never aired because they simply were , good . probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is w a l t e r , a spin off to m a s h with gary radar burghoff as the lead . hmmm , would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half hour trying to solve crimes ? hence , the show was never picked up . what many people don not know or what they thought they knew is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air , for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide . some have made they are way past and got onto the air the pilot for the animated series american dad comes to mind , as the show's serial itself didn not begin until nearly four months later . however , there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air , and this here is why . black bart , a supposed tie in with the mel brooks comedy classic , blazing saddles , is a stale and bland sitcom with little heart and no soul . saddles was a controversial comedy , nevertheless , with it's racist humor and vulgar comedy , which comes to mind what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv ? i say supposed , because none of the memorable characters from the movie , aside from bart , on in this mess of a tv show . mel brooks wasn not even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line in a related story , i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie clerks . that kevin smith was no involved see what happens ? . set somewhere around the same time as the movie or at all , the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west , named appropriately black bart , who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr . obviously before his stint in real acting , whereas in this he is playing a g rated richard pryor . most of the other characters are carbon if not , really bad copies of the characters in the movie jim , the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan , a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer , a more of a ripoff of the character being that she's a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich type accent and personality . while that's pretty much the end in similarities , the lead bad guy in the story is fern malaga , played by noble willingham , who i assumed would have been hedley lamar if warner bros . secured the rights to the name see trivia for blazing saddles and his son curley . i dunno , taggart i suppose ? the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom , much less a pilot . bart deals with the mayor's drunk son and he's out of control behavior which has caused the town to spin . really , it's a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the series and doesn not focus on the variety and context that would make this an alright show . i can not really call it a sitcom and even if i wanted to and that's primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros . studios and later added a laugh track , so the show is set up almost exactly like m a s h complete with a bland and dull laughing that is identical to the series . the acting is so so , but there's one part that always make me laugh , and that's when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue . ha ! the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie surprisingly , they use the word n er numerous amount of times through a 22 minute episode , rather touchy for it's time period and even for today and it gets repetitive . if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss . surly interesting novelty item , watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots it's on the collector's edition of blazing saddles , god knows why . there , yourself get a first hand chance for the reason why many movie tie in pilots never air .

1			movie	popular	part	bad	people	nice	guy	good			this was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it , the fast moving story , an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths , etc funny thing is , you probably couldn not make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the pc police . nonetheless , woody harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players , is interesting as is his main counterpart wesley snipes . snipes had a lot of funny put down lines , providing much of the humor . the bad part of the film which doesn not bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters . that includes woody's girlfriend , played by rosie perez . there are no really clean , nice people in this movie . for that reason , i can not honestly recommend the film , at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
1			life	meaningless no	they	disappointed	capitalism	good	thing	greatest	beliefs	spiritual	reality	hard	victory	spiritual	reality	physical			never before have the motives of the producers of a motion picture been more transparent . let's see first , they get every willing televangelist to hype this film as the greatest thing since sliced white bread . next , they encourage as many fundamentalist christians as possible to purchase copies of the film so as to recoup its paltry production costs and pump up its advertising budget . and finally , when the film hits the theaters , get as many said christians as possible to see it yet again , bus them into the multiplexes if necessary , not on the merits of the film itself , but because a 1 box office opening will be seen as some sort of profound spiritual victory . but that , of course , won not be enough . i imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give left behind anything short of a glowing review will be deemed anti christian . of course , this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign shouldn not surprise anyone . it is , after all , good old fashioned capitalism at work . what does surprise me is how many people have been suckered into the whole left behind mindset . as someone who tries to balance his spiritual beliefs with some sense of reason and rationality , it leaves me scratching my head . it would appear that there are many , many people who actually believe that sometime in the near future a rapture is going to occur , and that millions of people all over the earth are going to simultaneously vanish into thin air . what kind of reality , i wonder , are these people living in ? is this rapture something they actually believe in , or is it something they fervently want to believe in ? and when they reach the end of their lives and realize this rapture has not occurred , will they be disappointed and disillusioned ? will there still be people 100 years from now insisting that the rapture is imminent ? in a way , i almost wish that such an event would occur ! what an interesting day that would be ! what would be even more interesting is if the apocalypse were to occur in a more spectacular fashion , not in the anthropological sense the authors of the left behind series have portrayed , but as more of a stephen spielberg production , with boiling clouds , trumpets , angels descending out of the sky , moon turned to blood , the whole nine yards . imagine coming to the realization that it was all coming true , just as the evangelists had been warning for years , and that there was something more awesome than just the cold , hard , physical reality we inhabit . wouldn not that be something ? ? yet in the final analysis , it's that cold , hard , physical reality that i will content myself with . my life is not so meaningless that i need the fear of a rapture and the end times to make sense of it all . nor do i need heaven or hell to bribe or scare me into behaving decently , thank you very much .

1			explanation	logical	enjoyment	artistic	movies	best			the reason i intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life actually it was only 35 minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate indian cinema . all i have ever seen were few older movies of s . ray . browsing through imdb i came across this one and after seeing rating of 8.7 i concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment . oh my how wrong i was ! the only logical explanation for this rating of 8.7 is that most of 970 people who voted are indian and their only venture outside bolliwood production were adam sandler movies . with this rating this movie would be ranked on 9 h place on imdb list of 250 best movies above citizen cane , goodfellas of psycho ! i am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that i find worth remembering from this painful experience . my only hope is that there is a lot of hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid , with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music .

1			scene	romantic	guys	nice	anything	useful	america	young			i saw this in the theater when it came out , and just yesterday i saw it again on cable . this i was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is . the whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners . worst of all , it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20 something dating , even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves . the nice guys finish last , the jerky guys make out great , the jerkiest guys do be st the girls are all boy toy pushovers . only one character wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society , and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag , in a lushly filmed scene that we are supposed to think is romantic . what this really is is hollywood's concept of young america permissive , detached , promiscuous , conceited .
1			movie	paced	pitch	necessary no	accent	necessary no			this movie has a very broadway feel the backdrop , the acting , the noise and yet that's all it has . some 'sense of a broadway without the bang . the movie is slow paced , the picture disjointed , the singing pops up on you so that you suddenly are reminded it's a musical . disappointing sinatra intolerable sinatra's fianc surely , the pitch and the accent of her voice was unnecessary . tolerable mr i remember the numbers on my dice delight brando's understated singing very biased ! surprise how much jean simmons looks like vivien leigh in her havana scenes . it's the bone structure ! how i would have killed to have seen miss leigh in a role challenging brando again .
1			plot	weak	it	unique	concept	entire			this really was a waste of movie has a weak plot , the story is fragmented and ends very abruptly with many loopholes . though the animation is top notch . once the movie started , i tried to give it the benefit of the doubt by telling myself that it might get interesting in the later stage , but it was never unique . this same plot has been played over and over again , but what made it worse was that the major plot hole was the whole story on how to kill the writer could have done so much more with the entire concept , but seemed that he or she did not have their heart in it and wanted to close the movie as soon as it started . overall , too much hype but not able to deliver .
1			crime	biggest	nothing	original			i can not believe i am so angry after seeing this that i am about to write my first ever review on imdb . this disney documentary is nothing but a rehashed planet earth lite . now i knew going into this that it was advertised as from the people who brought you planet earth , but i had no idea they were going to blatantly use the exact same cuts as the groundbreaking documentary mini series . i just paid $ 8.75 to see something i already own on dvd . shame on disney for not warning people that there is absolutely nothing original here save a james earl jones voice over and 90 seconds of sailfish that i don not believe were in planet earth . but the biggest crime of all , is that while planet earth uses the tragic story of the polar bear as evidence that we are killing this planet and a catalyst for ecologic change , disney took that story and turned it into family friendly tripe . after the male polar bear's demise , they show his cubs grown significantly a year later , and spew some garbage about how they are ready to carry on his memory , and that the earth really is a beautiful place after all . no mention of the grown cubs impending deaths due to the same plight their father endured , no warning of trouble for future generations if we don not get our act together , nothing . just a montage of stuff we have already seen throughout the movie and many times more , if you are one of the billion people who have already seen planet earth . i have never left the theater feeling so ashamed and cheated in my life .
1			lines	bad	movie	worst	feel	sorry			just a warning . this is the worst movie i have seen in years . i couldn not watch it to the end . it is a pure waste of time . i really feel sorry for snipes that he ended up in such a movie . there really is not much to say about it . horrible acting , incredibly bad lines , story , everything . the only reason i would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn not be . just to tell you one scene the police are searching for snipes , and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars , they are shooting around inside the building , but still they are whispering so that snipes doesn not suspect a thing .
1			cast	entire	fire	nearest	looked	interesting			the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money . i bought it ex rental for 3.00 it looked interesting , so i took a chance . within minutes of turning it on i realised i would made a mistake . the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire , where they could meet more of their kind . as for the devin hamilton writer and director , he should just be shot , sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish . avoid this film , if you see it in the shops run away . 1 10
1			i	eager	seemed	silly	stars	big	idea	good	feel	realistic	waste	crappy	it	bad	climax	stupid	story	predictable	movie	worst			first off , i would like to point out that the reason why i gave this movie 1 star out of 10 is because there is no option to give it no stars ! it really is that bad ! i was never eager to see this film after i saw the ads for it , i ended up seeing it only by chance because some friends of mine had tickets and had one spare so i tagged along . before seeing it i had a fairly good idea that it wouldn not be genius the premise seemed far too silly and stupid for anything good to come out of it , but at the back of my mind i was thinking but there must be something good about it for uma thurman and luke wilson do to the film . not that i think either of them are particularly terrific but they are big named stars who would normally only do films that would enhance their reputations . however , about 10 -20 minutes into the feature i realized that the movie was probably worse than i had at first anticipated . i was shocked at how terrible the script was . it really gave the actors nothing to work with , so much so that they really looked like they didn not know what they were doing especially luke wilson . the story was completely predictable if you have seen the ad then you have pretty much seen the movie ! and there was nothing original about it it pretty much borrows from every 'super hero story that has ever been which would be acceptable had the film been set up as a satire of that genre , but alas it wasn not . the direction seemed to be of realism . i got the feeling that the director wanted the film to feel completely realistic and not satire at all , and yet there were some moments in the film that were so unbelievably unrealistic that it would have worked if it were a satire . at one moment in the movie two of the characters seem to die and one of the surviving characters has a line like oh well , she's to move on and he says it in such a droll voice that it completely didn not make any sense . i found myself checking my watch after about 40 minutes to see how much longer i would have to sit through it . and then it struck me . i began to think i wonder if the studio have made this picture as a test to see if they can make the worst possible movie ever made , and still pull a large audience . i couldn not think of any other reason why this film would be made . for movies to be made these days , the script goes to a massive screening process and very very few scripts actually make it to the production stage . i can not comprehend how this one got past the first draft stage . by the end , and exceedingly , dumb founding ly stupid climax , i was laughing heartily just not at what the film makers wanted me to laugh at , but instead at how ridiculous and stupid the movie was . thank god i didn not have to pay money to see it . because that would have really annoyed me ! ! oh , and could i just add , that of the two wilson brothers , i have always preferred luke because i think he is a better , more versatile if he wants to step even further into owen's shadow then this is exactly the way to do it . i doubt that he will get many more job offers after this crappy waste of 2 hours ! ! and remember , it only got a generous 1 10 because i couldn not select 0
1			intrigue	foreign	interest	romantic			yet another forgettable warners foreign intrigue thriller , this is rendered even less enjoyable by the irritating presence of lauren bacall , who , without humphrey bogart's tender attentions to humanize her , comes off as her usual shrill , shallow self . even master gigolo charles boyer cannot feign romantic interest in her .
1			editing	pathetic	screenplay	poor	it	sad	songs	bad			the movie was a huge disappointment . especially since it was directed by priyadarshan , it was sad to see such dismal standards . poor screenplay almost non existent and song sequences with bad songs every minute and at the most odd times killed whatever humor the movie could offer . some of the scenes were funny , but it amounted to probably only 5 mins of the whole duration . the editing was pathetic . dismal ! overall the movie disappointed as the lack of story was only too evident . in fact only a few people stayed to watch the second half of the movie after the interval . one wouldn not miss anything at all if you don not watch the movie . not worth spending valuable ticket money on this movie . wait till it appears on tv .

1			lifestyle	conventional	flick	offensive	mothers	good no	messes	miserable	release	theatrical			this is , without a doubt , the most offensive chick flick i have seen in years , if not ever . the writing & characterizations are so riddled with stereotypes that the film verges on parody . before walking out of the theater an hour and five minutes into this disaster , we were subjected to the following themes having a baby will solve all of your problems , performer types are miserable messes , & musicians can not be good mothers unless they toss their dreams for a more conventional lifestyle . what a waste of a talented cast & some great looking sets & costumes . when natasha richardson told toni collette that unless she lives a more mainstream life , she will end up shudder alone ! i felt queasy . i can not believe this movie made it to theatrical release . it's the sort of fare one expects from those women's cable channels that i always pass right by when channel surfing . i am female and over 35 so i should be part of this film's target audience , but boy , does evening miss its target .
1			isn	little	departure	eventual			they should have called this movie adopted mouse brother that is slightly inspired by someone's vague recollection of stuart little who just kind of skimmed the book a little , but mostly just remembered the cover if it wasn not so misleading i would give it a better review . but seriously people , do your kids a favor and have them read the book . they might actually learn something instead of having their mind numbed by what we all know as hollywood film . the book stuart little isn not about a mouse , it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse like . he's born to his parents , not adopted . the book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on . there is a cat named snowball who thinks he's food and wants to eat him , but snowball can not talk . in the movie they screw all of that up . i think the only things that they kept from the book were the boat race and the names .
1			movie	good	life	real	effort	best	audience	satisfied			this seemed to be a good movie , i thought it would be a good movie , and throughout the movie i was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time , and yes , i have to admit that the acting talent of dimple kapadia and deepti naval where truly commendable , but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message , which it seems is it seemed was what somnath sen is trying to do . the final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens ; a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2 rs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied , if indeed that was the director's intention . this falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the mo st another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo typing of the american characters they all seem to be carved out of the same block . seems to me that most american characters in indian english movies are based upon how common indians themselves perceive americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any american in the movie . these two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story .
1			ones	good	movies	bad	rubbish	low	twist	potential	rubbish	bad			as a movie critic for several dutch websites , i have to see lot's of movies , and not all very good ones . some movies are so bad , you won not be surprised that they are released straight on video . with taboo , im surprised that it is released on video at all . this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish . a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo . they write down their most sickening wish or act , and later on people are murdered for their taboo's . the question is , should we believe what we see ? the movie has a potential interesting plot twist , and i won not give it away here . but what could have been interesting stays stupid , bad acted and without any reason . some of the actors have played in bigger titles before , so why on earth did they sign up for this ? if you see this anywhere , try to dodge it . there is no logic , no human sense of quality in this movie .

1			violence	gratuitous			the director , outfitted in chains and leather , warned the audience at the sf frameline film festival friday night that we were about to see an experiental film . experimental ? leave the video camera on the back seat of the car , let the tape roll and edit in all the pointless dreck within eyesight . a meandering pastiche road show manqu that starts nowhere and takes the audience no place . the gratuitous violence that opens the movie drove more than one patron from the castro theater . i would have left , too , but my cine buddy needed a ride home and has this thing about seeing even the worse merde through to the end . by the time the lights came up the audience had thinned considerably . tepid applause . pro forma questions of the director who seemed pleased with the product . avoid this film !
1			trek	good	they	big	captains	strong	shows	previous	thing	good	glory	old	attitude	strong	hf	glad	captain	feeble			how low can someone sink while trying to recapture an old glory ? st hf will be glad to show you . if you are used to seeing what made for a good star trek show , do not watch this . the writing is hodge podge , the actors portrayals of their characters weak , and most of all , the design work is downright doggy . like watching strong captains , don not look here ! like the strong federation attitude ? forget about it here ! starfleet is mocked by ensigns wearing spikes in their hair . while a seemingly mentally feeble captain shuffles about and within two minutes of the opening show's credits , ensign spikey is attempting to arrange a tryst with an engineer . it just degrades from there . no , not even uniforms match , for goodness sake . they are too small or too big , collars down to their chests , and tng seasons one and two uniforms mixed in with season three and ds 9 unifor ms the strict discipline and tradition of any of the originals in lacking in this production down to the treads ! the only good thing about this show is its graphics , which seem to improve a bit with each season . ok , i take that back . who uses cg that inexpertly ? the designers of this show . don not bother with it , it will offend your star trek sense , as it did mine . not even the throw backs to previous shows can save this catastrophe . i wept openly when i watched this , probably because my eyes were bleeding and my head almost ruptured . that bad .
1			lesson	good			this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one . and i m jewish . anbody go to journalism school ? read an editorial ? freshman year rhetoric ? these alarmist assertions , presented in a palatable way , might prove persuasive . but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments , nor viable or any at all solutions , few sources and each of dubious origin , makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe . and thank goodness for that i wouldn not want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap . a good lesson for me and hopefully a cautionary tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it .
1			things	little	it	good	things	wrong			just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home . she then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why . this is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn not quite . i can not really put my finger on why it didn not work but it was good enough that i kind of wished it was better , or at least had gotten the little things right like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size . i think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong .
1			budget	low			no wonder pamela springsteen gave up acting to become a full time photographer ; it's a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one . while this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell , etc , it is outweighed by flaws . for one thing , angela , the murderous counselor , appears to be about the same age as the campers . having an older , more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film . and then you have the murder scenes . the budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended , although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original . but overall , there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier / more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching .

1			it	difficult	level	necessary	he	young	lover	former	something	interesting	place	best	effort	tremendous	erwin	young	chat	little			this is a confused and incoherent mess of interminable scenes of boring dialogues and monologues . that is no exaggeration you have to make a tremendous effort to even try to become involved with it . i sincerely thought fassbinder would make something interesting in order to tell why does erwin / elvira suicides at the end , but instead of this , in every scene somebody is trying to explain when he was young , this happened . and he just came back from casablanca and ordered to cut everything down there . etc soon in the movie , erwin / elvira is in a slaughter house talking with a friend prostitute certainly a slaughter house is the best place for a pleasant little chat , and while telling her the story of elvira's life , fassbinder shows the killing of one cow after the other . it is difficult to choose between giving attention to the disturbing images or what the transvestite is saying . of course we come to the very forced and coarse symbolism of i have suffered much in my life , and am about to die . in one of the sparse moments where actually happens something , erwin / elvira encounters a former lover , that only after performing a extremely gay choreography with two other guys as if going for the necessary level of homosexuality is that he recognizes elvira . there are some interesting shots and ideas , i must admit such as when the nun tells the story of the young erwin , but everything on the movie is wasted due to fassbinder's self indulgence .
1			they	good	something	intellectual	issues	psychological	francophile	big			i read the reviews of this movie , and they were generally pretty good so i thought i should see it . i m a big francophile and art film lover , but i believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not . i will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that i never , ever wanted to actually see . obviously , the piano teacher has some major psychological issues , but i really did not want to see them displayed so graphically . the film is , in essence , disgusting . i mean , when i saw requiem for a dream , i was repulsed by the last sort of scene with jennifer connelly , but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion i felt during this film .

it's about a hit man , my friend said . well . . and it's brazilian , i added . beautiful multicolored people , tropical weather , lush rhythms , and a hip gangster plot ? ample enticements no doubt . somebody forgot to tell us one little detail this is a very bad movie , really pretty horrible , and as unpleasant to watch as it is poorly made . so how on earth did contra todos get to make the rounds of berlin , melbourne , london , manila , stockholm , cairo , chicago , numerous smaller local festivals , and now san francisco ? apparently , because of the way the promotional process and the film festival circuit work . first of all , it won first prize at the rio film festival where it was called the best brazilian movie of the year . it must have been a bad year ; they have had much , much better ones . next , snappy synopses in catalogs plus imaginary buzz lead to crowded auditoriums and since the movie isn not featured anywhere and so avoids close scrutiny by critics it keeps going the rounds . festival blurbs aimed at promotion sometimes goose it up a lot . a chicago festival one called contra todos a speedball cocktail shot straight out of brazil and referred to claudia's s boyfriend as the stud of the slum like neighborhood . soninha is teodoro's nymph like teen aged daughter of burgeoning sexuality . the movie is shot with the urgency of a frequently hand held camera and the director works up a genuine and palpable sense of frustration borne from domestic desperation and decay . the effect is unbearably raw and honest , and the movie hurtles toward a conclusion as dead ended as the lives on display . not the best writing , but it sure pumps up the excitement for a certain kind of potential viewer . contra todos does concern a hit man , two hit men actually , and a wife and daughter and a born again christian girlfriend . it's shot in execrably ugly digital video with no talent behind the camera work mostly in a barren looking poor suburb rather than in one of the teeming favelas or village like brazilian city slums where such wonderful films as black orpheus , pixote , and city of god were made , and not in rio this time , but so paulo . the hit man with family problems is teodoro giulio lopez and his partner with a drug problem is waldomiro ailtan graa . both actors have a little tv experience as does the actress who plays teodoro's sluttish blonde wife cludia leona cavalli and silvia loreno who plays his pouting , ready to revolt daughter soninha . these actors might make it through the back corners of a few telenovelas . who knows ? in a better directed film they might even be good . aside from them there are some young men who get bumped off by teordoro or , when he's busy , gangs of thugs . the principals don not work up much presence , even though the camera magnifies their pores . a couple of observers , one at the berlin festival and one at london's , did see this movie's failings but alas they are buried in the web hinterlands . henry sheehan noted from berlin that the film his quotes was the worst of the video works shown . the filmmaker seems to have chosen video simply because it was a cheap alternative to film , sheehan wrote , and hasn not made any creative use of the new medium nor , he adds , done anything else creative . sheehan pointed out the movie's first big mistake it starts off as a domestic drama that's supposed to ratchet up when , half an hour into the action , moreira reveals that the father and one of his friends are professional hit men . waiting the thirty minutes adds nothing to the movie ; it seems like a perfectly arbitrary decision and is , at the very least , a waste of time . but ratcheting up is all moreira ever does , like a little kid who's gotten a tool kit for his birthday , and goes around banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill . devastating , but true . writing about the 2004 london festival for , metin alsanjak tried to look at the positive side but nonetheless gave away the lack of redeeming features in calling the performances easily the film's best feature . yes , very easily , given that everything else is so bad . alsanjak admitted that this low budget , violent and seedy account of the lawless in sao paulo is devoid of any likable characters , and as a result , of hope . too dark and cynical to be a telling account of the human condition , the film is not helped by poor subtitling . . alsanjak's connecting contra todos to dogme and mike leigh didn not help matters . apart from that meaningless first half hour in which nothing redeems the boredom of our wait for the first acts of violence which , when they come , are just banging everything in sight without rhyme , reason or skill moreira clumsily tries to redeem his abrupt finale by adding what appear to be outtakes right after it , followed by an implausible ironic concluding scene where one of the characters gets married . no doubt the director wanted to exhibit the banality of evil of low level hit men in working class neighborhoods , but he can not make the characters , which he sees generically , come alive for us . and the structure of the film shows that he also can not edit his material . seen at the san francisco international film festival on april 28 2005
1			behavior	good	kindness	bad	fabric	social	behavior	bad	way	positive	issue	moral	statement	political no	fabric	moral			when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider , are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way ? this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society . when a comedian / actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves do i want to support that behavior ? in this case mr foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong , good behavior from bad that loving kindness is better than hatefulness . mr foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from . saying sorry does not get him off the hook . it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth . one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it . no longer see anything they are part of . we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them .

the special effects team decrees it . marky's chimp gets lost in that staple of 60 sci fi cinema the time warp . marky then demonstrates the space station's mind boggling security ineptness by stealing a pod without anyone noticing , while simultaneously demonstrating his abject stupidity in mounting a deep space rescue mission into a worm hole for an expendable test chimp , with a million dollar vehicle with limited fuel and oxygen supplies . before anyone can say `pointless remake marky has surfed the worm hole , crashed on an alien planet , removed his helmet without any thought to the lethality of the atmosphere and is being chased through a sound stage that almost resembles a lush rainforest , if it weren not for the kliegs backlighting the plastic trees . surprise ! it's apes doing the chasing or at least , it would have been a surprise if no one saw planet of the apes thirty three years ago . since marky mark did not get to show his pecs , take down his pants , or bust his lame whiteboy rap , he was characterless . michael clarke duncan's gorilla teeth being inserted crookedly helped immensely in establishing his lack of character . helena bonham carter aka irritating chimp activist , at a loss without a shakespearean script , did a fine job of outdoing both marky and clarke as most cardboard cutout . paul giamatti , the orangutan slave trader , secured the role of token comic relief and interspecies klutz . though i have grown bilious in hearing puns relating to this movie , one review headline captured the essence of this planet of the apes `re imagining `the apes of roth . while everyone else minced about looking like extras from one million years bc or greystoke , tim roth , as chimpanzee thade , chews massive amounts of scenery and hurls kaka splendiferously . as entertaining as his portrayal of the psychotic thade was , his character lacked a behavioral arc thade is mad when we first meet him . and he's pretty much at the same level of mad at film's end . nice twi st the original pota 1968 featured a leading character , charlton heston's taylor , who was so disenchanted with mankind that he left earth for space with no regrets yet as that film progressed , taylor unwittingly found himself locked in a battle to prove mankind's worth as their sole champion ! the original film was ultimately a tale of humiliation , not salvation when taylor discovers the statue of liberty , he is forced to realize that his species had not prevailed . is there anything that cerebral or ironic to marky mark's leo ? or roth's thade ? no , but there's lots of running . the slogans cry take back the planet . but it's the apes planet . in this movie , humans and apes crash landed here together , the humans having degenerated to cavepeople , allowing the apes to acquire speech and sensual body armor ; the apes deserved to inherit the planet ! along comes marky mark , in true anthropocentric arrogance , taking it for granted that humans have to be the apex predators , simply because they are there . `taking it back is as ludicrous as apes landing here in 2001 complaining , `a planet where men evolved from apes ? and then causing trouble with their overacting and hairy anuses . heston was cast in the 1968 pota because he had established his reputation as a maverick he was ben hur , michelangelo , moses ! to cast him as the mute , dogged animal in an alien society was to stupefy an audience's expectations how crazed must a world be where our man charlton cannot command respect ? marky mark has currently only established that he has tight underpants . though heston was denigrated constantly by the ape council , he dominated the screen with his charisma and stupendous overacting . when marky mark tries to instill fervor in the mongoloid humans , it's like that unpopular guy in school suddenly being made classroom monitor , who tells you to stop drawing penises on the blackboard and you throw a shoe at him . burton tries to elevate marky to humanity's icon , but he comes off as a chittering deviant . in the original film , the apes deem taylor a deviant , yet he was , to audience and apes alike , an icon of humanity . that irony again . it was apt that a man who elevated scene chewing to an acting technique heston should play the father of this film's primo scene chewer , thaddeus roth . as roth's ape dad , charlton utters his own immortal lines , turned against the humans this time , `damn them ! damn them all to hell ! the movie gets dumb and dumber towards the end . while thaddeus is giving marky an ass beating lesson , a pod descends from on high with marky's chimpnaut in it . apes demonstrate their hebetude by bowing in obeisance to this incognizant creature , while marky proves his own hebetude by muttering , `let's teach these monkeys about evolution . firstly , they are not monkeys , you ape ! secondly , it was genetic tampering and imbecilic plot fabrications which brought the apes to this point , not evolution . and what you intend to teach them by blowing them away with the concealed lasergun is called misanthropy , not evolution . giving away the twist ending would only confuse viewers into believing that estella warren's half nekkid role was actually integral to the plot be still my pants . no matter that he was humankind's last underpanted hope ; in the end , cop apes take marky away to plot point prison where he was last heard ululating , `it's a madhouse ! a madhouse !
1			world	real	attempts	feeble	boy	little	reviews	good	dad	evil	it	horrific	boy	ill	it	scary			after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review . this is my first ever so bare with me . first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in no way is it horrific or scary in the slightest with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me . i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn not particularly thrilled either ! the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times . during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing , after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality . as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in . until she adds her constantly away father to the house , due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches . think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach . in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab !
1			dialogue	worst	gem	little	laughs	good	movie	bad	film	worst			i knew nothing of this film before i was convinced to see it by a friend who had heard it was a non stop epic battle scene from beginning to end . that couldn not have been further from the truth . this was one of the most boring , poorly written , amateurishly directed , horribly acted films i have ever had the misfortune to lay my eyes upon . i would rank it up there with the movie i consider to be the worst film of all time . battlefield earth . there basically is no story , it's hard to believe that the makers of this film thought that this cheesy soap opera crap would be taken seriously as actual historic fact . it also features some of the worst dialogue i have ever hea rd . like this little gem . guy tells girl you smell like the moon . girl replies what does the moon smell like ? omg ! you have to be kidding me ! the scene where the guy was drawn and quartered got some good laughs from the audience since it looked so ridiculously cheap and the sound fx of the guy being ripped apart reminded me of someone making a fart sound with their mouth . if this is playing at a theater near you , avoid it at all costs . this movie is so bad that i actually made the decision about 45 minutes through that i needed to catch up on my sleep . and i did . awful .

1			persecution	psychological	romance	eventual	complexities	psychological	film	interesting	perspective	artistic	study	usual no	film	memorable	asset	greatest	locations	gorgeous			maladolescenza has the air of a dark fairy tale , with its child protagonists , forest setting , and the discovery of a castle's ruins . yet at its core , the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents . opening with a dream sequence employing the not so subtle metaphor of fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound , the film details his psychological persecution of laura , the girl who has pledged her love to him , and his eventual romance with the equally malicious sylvia . the film's psychological complexities do give the film merit , yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex . the film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill , and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy , children's choir augmented soundtrack . with its odd dreamlike quality , the film is at best interesting , yet pales beside louis malle's surreal and brilliant black moon from the same era . certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate , for unlike many banned films , pasolini's 'salo or larry clark's ken park for instance , the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective . cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock , so perhaps maladolescenza should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release . however shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable . the film does have its defenders . yet so does nazism .

1			shrine	religious	onlookers	low	loco	local	son	old	piece	worst			this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced , written and directed vanity project . while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me before the burning at the stake sequence this is the worst piece of sh t i have ever worked on i have worked on a lot of pieces of sh t . also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario a religious shrine in chimay at which point one of the local vato loco low rider onlookers growled some respect man , which apparently caused jim to remember where he was , as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior . in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories like the night we caught the producer / director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in . like they say ya gotta love the biz .

1			flashbacks	constant			return of the boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn not play like a movie , it plays like an episode of a tv sitcom when they flashback to older episodes . return of the boogyman is just a clip show . mutch of the film is constant and annoying flashbacks from the first movie . over and over again the same footage . how boring this is . the movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie . i have seen the first movie i don not want to see the same scenes over and over again and i don not know who would . the whole movie looks like it was quickly made to make a few bucks and thats it .

1			manner	flat	scenes	bad	beaton	appealing	actor	best	collection	available	i	surprised	cooper	good	part	big no			mistress of the craft celeste works as an agent for the london branch of interpol's bureau 17 which specializes in i think occult criminals . she possesses the eye of destiny , good in her hands , dangerous if anyone else got it . bureau 17 has caught a satanist from california , hyde no relation to dr jekyll . detective lucy lutz of lapd flies to england to bring him back to the us . lutz is the connection to the earlier witchcraft movies , having been played by stephanie beaton before in witchcraft 9 in part 7 lutz was played by another woman ; in 6 lutz was a man ! lutz's part in 9 was not terribly big , but she's one of the main stars in this one . though she's left behind her high heels and short skirts , she still has revealing tops in this one . and this time around she has nude and sex scenes . beaton is pretty appealing in the role . as usual , there are a number of sex scenes . an anonymous clubgoer has a fatal threesome with two vampires , the satanist and head vampire get it on with some kink , lutz finds an english pal , and celeste and her boyfriend make love . the main recurring character of the witchcraft series , will spanner , does not appear in this one , although lutz mentions him to bureau 17 agent dixon in a conversation about vampires . she also phones her partner detective garner parts 6 7 and 9 , though we don not hear his end of the conversation . hyde is sprung from jail by a group of vampires led by raven , for a walpurgis ritual having something to do with a god named morsheba i think . hyde delivers all of his lines in a very flat manner , while raven overacts to a campy degree . the fight scenes are terribly choreographed . the audio in the movie was pretty poorly recorded , and poorly edited . additionally , some dialogue gets lost under blaring music or sirens . cinematography isn not great either . having the movie set in and actually shot in the uk was a bit of a novelty though , at least for this series . wendy cooper is very good as celeste ; attractive , certainly , but more importantly she's easily the best actor in the movie bad fight scenes notwithstanding . i m quite surprised her filmography is so small . if there's ever a witchcraft xiv , and i would bet there will be , they should bring her back , even if it means flying her to california ! witchcraft x is available on its own , or in the dvd collection hotter than hell along with witchcraft xi and two unrelated movies .

1			danger	direct	film	worth	minutes	believable	population	total	scenes	nice	orders	direct	roads	safe no			although a film with bruce willis is always worth watching , you better skip this one . i watched this one on television , so i didn not have to plunk down cash for it . lucky me . the plot develops slowly , very slowly . although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable , it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end . it is highly questionable , if a seasoned soldier like lt . waters would disobey direct orders . and even if he would , if the rest of his platoon would . they know he puts them in direct danger , and they know they will certainly die if they follow him , but what the heck , he is our lt . so let's do what he says despite the direct orders , remember . still , there are some nice scenes in this movie . they somewhat save a village , where the total population is being massacred by the rebels . well , they save a dozen villagers or so , the rest was already killed . the strange part of it , that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind . they rather go on foot . maybe because the roads are unsafe , but there was no explanation for it . anyway . i think this was what earned the movie the one point i gave it . what made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves . only near the end they loose a few comrades . and that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more . can you believe that ? they fight of an army of so many , kill hundreds of them , and only loose a few of themselves . and they have rounds and round of ammo . never run out of it . grenades and claymore mines , an m 60 machine gun and even an rpg . where do they get this stuff . carrying it around or what ? they even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels . and this laptop has a battery which goes on for days . really ? who think up this crap . i guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots , you give this movie a high rating . if not , skip this one . it saves you time .
1			female	local	acting	improvised	it	boring	change	noticeable			wow ! i just was given this film from a friend of mine , who bought it for 1.98 at walmart , and he felt that he got taken ! it is beyond boring , most of the scenes are filmed in front of a green screen , the acting is somewhat improvised , almost as if they didn not have a script . the martians are cgi , which look like they were done by a novice , or a fan produced movie . i cannot stress just how bad this dvd really is ! example in one of the scenes , the martians are torturing a local female captive . she goes from a woman in front of a green screen , to a cgi copy of that woman . the change is totally noticeable , and when she is killed , you can see that it is a computer figure , looking like something from a game back in 1990 if at all possible , avoid this movie like the plague ! you can download two trailers from their site , and see how god awful it really is !

1			glover	serious	juxtapositions	fantastic			i firstly and completely and confidently disagree with the user who calls this a spoof . crispin glover is very serious about his film . he personally introduced the film at the screening i saw in chicago . he had worked on the film for years and it is the first in an intended trilogy . what is it ? is crispin glover's attempt at an art film in the vein of those he idolizes by herzog , lynch etc i had heard rumor of this film years ago epic porno movie with all down syndrome cast directed by crispin glover . when it finally came out i watched the trailer on line and read the synopsis and i was foaming at the mouth with anticipation . i went to chicago to see it and it was a major disappointment . if he took out the goofy sh t , such as the pot smoking grandma , and the dancing dolls , he would be left with something much better , but only about 10 minutes long . in other words just watch the trailer , be entertained , and leave it at that . there are some striking images and fantastic juxtapositions and phrases , but its lack of focus amounts to disappointment .

1			tale	classic	tv	special	it	good no	act	classic			having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases , i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr seuss classic tale , and well . it's not very good . first off , following a classic act like chuck jones animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone , but this interpretation is so heavy handed and padded as to be positively numbing . i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags , but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab , at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas . jim carrey is typically over the top here , but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch . as characterised by boris karloff , he was a slow burn ; methodical and sly . there is no method to carrey's madness , and that is only the most obvious error made . talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here . why , universal , why ? i mean , i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered much like his countryman michael caine , but this one needs to be filed under films that should never have been made . this does not bode well for the cat in the hat , an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas . i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one skip it , and either read the book or watch the tv special . this is 2 hours you can never , ever get back .
1			movie	worst			oh my god . the idea that this movie is a thriller is an absolute joke to me . besides the point that it seems to be written by a 5 year old . the plot , the acting and even the props and filming of this movie were all beyond disgrace . i am not usually this critical about any movie , cause every person has his / her style . but this movie , however , was probably the worst movie i have seen in 2008 i can honestly believe that this movie is unknown , and i think it should stay like this , for movies like these are making the thriller genre a joke . i advise anyone that is a fan of thriller movies , or even simply movies to stay far away from this one .

1			movie	likable	movie	funny no	comedies	romantic	moment	good	one	good	bell	attractive	longoria	attractive	garbage	original no	man	gay	behavior	unbelievable	ending	happy			this film is shoddily made , unoriginal garbage . i like romantic comedies sometimes . watching a good one is like eating ice cream for dinner . it's not something you are going to do all the time , but the experience is so pleasurable that you can ignore how unwise you are being . this movie made me think about how stupid i was for continuing to remain seated for its entire running time . everything about it screamed made on the cheap . it actually looks like they overexposed the film at certain points it is so washed out . it boasts cheesy cgi and lame sets , too . the writing was clunky . i know that you can usually expect some plot problems in a screwball comedy , but you usually don not really care because you are laughing . this movie is so unfunny that you actually sit there and wonder about the unlikely series of coincidences and completely unbelievable behavior involved . events were placed in the film just to move the characters from one scene to the next or to provide exposition . sure , this is how all movies work , but you shouldn not notice that it's happening . inelegant . that's the term i should use . there was almost no one in the movie who was really likable . i didn not care who ended up with whom , as long as they all stayed the hell away from me , and i didn not have to listen to them talk about it anymore . why would the only really cool character in the movie , the paul rudd character , want to have anything to do with the completely bitchy , condescending , control freak played by eva longoria ? also , almost all of the characters involved consistently picked the sleaziest solution to any situation . a straight man pretends to be gay for five years just to hang out and bathe with with a woman he is attracted to ? the best feel good moment they could come up with was to tack on a happy ending for the same schmoe where he gets together with rudd's equally annoying lying , kleptomaniac sister ? lake bell and eva longoria are very attractive , appealing women . maybe they will find something better to appear in down the road .
1			it	boring	act	little			broad enough for you ? wait till you see this heavy handed adaption of a little collegiate one act . what is shocking and wild in college rarely holds up over time , and this is proof . to take on the catholic church with broadside humor just isn not shocking or interesting or funny , it's kind of boring . the performers are all game , giving all they have got , but it's basically a play that doesn not open up to film well . not a lot of fun .
1			script	idiotic	characters	central	dancing	little	twosome	glamorous	moments	musical	twosome	real no			the wife of a stage producer in london hopes to fix up the american song and dance man starring in her husband's latest show with an acquaintance , an american girl who makes her living modeling fashions in society circles . unfortunately , the couple has already met on their own , with the girl thinking the guy is actually the show producer married to her friend the fact he's not wearing a wedding ring should have discouraged any misunderstandings ! wafty fred astaire ginger rogers musical is eventually dragged back down to the earth by dwight taylor and allan scott's idiotic script , which is full of juvenile behavior . astaire and rogers don not just meet cute they meet ridiculously he's tap dancing like a madman in the hotel suite above hers and she complains . audiences of 1935 probably didn not care how these two were going to get together as long as they did so , and happily . seen today , the central characters appear to have no motivation to end up in each other's arms he plies her with flowers after telling his friend he wants to remain fancy free in the love department and she gives him the brush off . nothing that a little dancing couldn not cure ! this glamorous twosome are as deliberately unreal as are the london and venice settings , but we watch simply because the leads are fred and ginger . it's a fantasy for who don not mind the dumbed down plot . the musical moments do break up the monotony of the contrived scenario , yet fail to transcend the surrounding silliness . from

1			something	reminiscent	look	silly	it	terrible	rangers	dreadful	action	live			very rarely do i give less rave reviews on a show or film i dislike on imdb , but mighty morphin power rangers is just so painstakingly dreadful , it's terrible . i wouldn not have minded if this had been an animated series would have been better that way i guess , but as a live action show , it typifies the terms cheesy and campy . of which power rangers is . five multi coloured , spandex wearing teens battle evil by using their martial arts skills . the costumes are horrid they look like something that is reminiscent of what track and field athletes and female gymnasts would wear . the acting is woeful , and the fight choreography is so shockingly bad and so lame to watch , it makes jean claude van damme , look as equally as good as bruce lee , which is an understatement in itself . in fact , they look as if they are jumping and dancing about ; like it was some version of the nutcracker , or they were doing ballet , rather than fighting . besides , there are some cartoons that heavily feature martial arts and yet it is done in a fun yet not so cheesy way that makes it look silly . kids show or not , this is just so lame and on the verge of absurdity . and even though this version is set in america , you could be forgiven into thinking that as you watch some of the fight sequences that they were not filmed in the us , but rather in japan ; thus the somewhat fake fighting and footage was borrowed from the japanese version only to be juxtaposed onto the us version . if you like this type of thing , then stick with sentai the japanese equivalent .
1			way	easy	wargames	old	references	direct	spoilers	hate	movie	worst	movie	bad	feel	comfortable			like many others have commented before me here , i have to say that this movie is bad , but not the worst i have seen . there will be no direct references to movie plots or sequences in this comment , because i hate spoilers . i got a feeling i was watching an episode of a tv show or something , where they had gotten a hold of some extra $$$ to spend on cgi i have seen worse of those . all in all , it is quite an insult to the viewer , at least if you have any knowledge about computers and / or technology at all . there are just too many of these moments of insults to make me feel comfortable , and i found myself just begging for it all to end fast halfway through . in addition , there are countless easy way out scenarios , which also is an insult to your intelligence as a thinking human being . this movie absolutely fades in comparison to the old wargames , and i think it's a damn shame they even got to call it a sequel . two stars from me , because of one thing and one thing only the actors performances aren not half bad , considering the regurgitated crap of a script they had to work with . still , they should never have signed on to this movie . not really a career move , but i guess we all have bills to pay . to those of you who gave this movie top have to be on the studio's payroll or something , that's my only explanation . to all who haven not seen this one by all means , watch it and make up your own mind . but lower your expectations to the floor and then some .
1			system	nervous	it	hard	professionalism	true			i find it hard to understand why this piece of utter trash was repackaged . the only saving grace in the whole thing is the body of ariauna in her sexy uniform . her humour is also to be appreciated . she is a definite plus but alas it would take a magician to salvage this garbage . however she must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism . can not say the same for her co star lilith with her whining voice that grates on your nervous system . appeared disinterested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was all that was needed . all said apart from ariauna's performance it is indeed utter trash .

1			guy	old	creepy	attractive			let me first say , i watched this movie around midnight , and usually there only is trash around this hour , but this movie broke the record first of all the main character is an old non attractive creepy guy , yet he gets to f ck all girls that come on his path for example he goes to a shop , talks to a girl and then you see them f ck secondly there are loads of sex scenes , and in many of them there is no nudity at all , i would not have been surprised if one of the characters in the movie would say fast put your clothes on so we can f ck ! thirdly this movie should show what a sexual addiction can do to a man or a family , this movie only shows soft bad acted erotica it makes me wonder why those actors agreed to play in such trash

1			thing	poor	effect	hypnotic	man	little	officer	weary	farce	comic	officer	poor	luck	bad	film	worst			this could well be the worst film i have ever seen . despite what mikshelt claims , this movie isn not even close to being historically accurate . it starts badly and then it's all downhill from there . we have hitler's father cursing his own bad luck on the fact that he would married his niece ! they were in fact , second cousins . hitler's mother , klara , called his father , alois , uncle because alois had been adopted and raised by klara's grandfather and brought up as his son , when he was really his nephew . alois was much older than klara and so as a child she would got into the habit of calling alois , uncle . the scene in the trenches where hitler is mocked by his fellow soldiers and decides to take it out on his dog is simply a disgrace and an insult to the intelligence of all viewers . we see hitler chase the dog through the trench , when he catches up with the poor thing he proceeds to thrash it for disobeying him . in the distance we see and hear his fellow soldiers continue to mock and chastise the cowardly little man , but then a shell lands directly on his persecutors , and every last one , we are told , is killed outright . how then , if hitler was the only person to survive the scene , did this tale of brutality and cowardice come to be told ? did hitler himself go around boasting about it ? i don not think so . next up , hitler bullies and intimidates a poor , stressed out and war weary jewish officer into giving him an iron cross ! i can only assume that this jewish officer had been a pawnbroker before fighting for the fatherland , and had thoughtfully brought along some pledged medals from his shop , because i m certain that iron crosses were not being handed out as shown in this comic farce . all the grotesque clichs are here , not least the calming and hypnotic effect of wagner's music upon the little man . if only the producers had kept ian kershaw on side . then they might have discovered that franz lehar's merry widow was more likely to float the fuhrer's boat than any flying dutchman from the cannon of richard wagner ! hitler may have been responsible for the deaths of 60 million people but how can he ever be forgiven for his appalling taste in music ? i could go on but i would be at it for hours . give it a miss .
1			formulas	simplistic	continuity	real	exposed	respectable	it	refreshing			a gentleman's game uses the game of golf in a country club setting to illustrate an adolescent's discovery about honesty , prejudice , and other life lessons . several times i thought i knew where this film was heading , only to be proved wrong . unfortunately , i m not so sure that the filmmakers ever knew where it was heading , either . the defining moment in this movie is probably the scene in which gary sinise mocks the karate kid and debunks any notions that he's going to become a mentor to the adolescent golfer . it's refreshing , in a way , that this movie refuses to follow most of the simplistic and over worked movie formulas . however , too much of it still comes off as contrived . at the drop of a hat people drop all pretenses of civility , or fail to stick up for the things in which they believe , or are exposed for something far less respectable than their place in society assumes . unfortunately , there is often no resolution to these moments . and except for the fact that the club serves as backdrop for them , there is no real continuity or linking of them . it's a shame that the writers and director could not salvage a better film , especially given some of the talented actors and potential in the setup .
1			anyone	dead	looks	interesting	they	bad	scenes	serious	city	new	movies	horrendous			checking the spoiler alert just in case . perhaps one of the most horrendous movies i have ever seen , mazes and monsters felt like i wasted 101 minutes of my life . the only redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious , but just ended up being funny since they were so bad . evil dead anyone ? unfortunately for m&m fortunately for us it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy . this movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character , robbie played by hanks encountered throughout the film . it ended up being a fear mongering video about stereotypes that helped fuel the d&d is the devil movement in the 80 . if you want to avoid wasting your time and money , steer clear of this junk . ps even though the cover looks kinda interesting , which is why i guess my brother bought it , it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm , unless you consider new england or new york city to be such a place .
1			suspense	good	scene	good	version	bad	point	good	amount	real			i love horror movies that brings out a real amount of mystery like say silent hill which i found to be quite good , but still , was missing something and movies that keeps you guessing , this i thought was one of those movies . at first the movie starts out with some really good suspense and builds up a good starting point for a good horror scene , but after that it just rolls down the hill and from there it only goes faster and faster down . i mentioned silent hill at first for a reason because i can see a lot of stolen themes from that movie in here . all in all i would say , watch silent hill instead of this one , its better , its more scary , it has a lot more suspense and also the ending is a lot better . and best of all , you wont feel ripped off as i did with this one . this just seems to be one of those i like that movie so i m gonna re make it in my own really bad version kinda movie . oh and one more thing . lordi . in a horror movie . thats like trying to scare a kid with a care bear who has hug me and i will love you forever written on the stomach of it .

1			enough	bad no	movie	good no			this will be best known for the ferrari that was crashed when eddie griffin was doing promotion . tale of racing and betting is a poorly made by the numbers that appears to have a director who couldn not see the numbers . largely a point and shoot affair with a group of actors in it for a paycheck . this is not a good movie , but its not bad enough to be watchable and end up as a some what nothing film isn not worth bothering with no matter how you look at it . misogynistic , despite the fact one of the leads is a woman , this is a film that was clearly made just to get the producer and director close to pretty girls . want evidence ? there are long lingering shots of women in next to nothing that serve no purpose other than perhaps to get a rise out of people too afraid to rent a porno or the sports illustrated swimsuit dvd . avoid this movie at all costs
1			nudity	easy	movie	best	script	stupid	film	crap	guys	old	he	bored	campaign	original	jokes	pathetic	guys	young			back in 1985 i caught this thing i can not even call it a movie on cable . i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control . i figured out early on that this was hopeless . stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women , bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes . the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while but even he was bored after 30 minutes in . remember this was a high school boy ! this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such . we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened . the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap ! one poster had a fictional review that said , this is the best movie i have seen this afternoon ! only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business . no budget and boring t&a . skip it .

1			idea	original	boy	little	seems	evil	jed	good	weather	bad	friend	best	side	quiet	dream	bad	wards	good	side	good			imagine that in adapting a james bond novel into a movie , the filmmakers eliminated all the action and suspense in order to make it kid friendly . or if a television producer told chris rock he couldn not cuss so that his specials could be rated pg . in the same way , the director of the movie something wicked this way comes took out the excitement and gore in favor of melodrama for younger audiences . this created a monotonous plot without the complications of the book . in trying to make the story of something wicked this way comes easier for children to follow , the filmmakers eliminated the theme of good and evil both existing in everyone , and good always prevailing over evil . this is apparent in will's character transformation , charles halloway's rescue of jim , and the carnival's defeat . will's transformation into a more adventurous boy has been muted in the movie . the scene in which the dust witch visits will's house in a balloon has been cut from the film . instead , a green mist follows jim and will home and gives them the same bad dream about the witch and her spiders . the balloon attack shows us that will has begun to conquer his fear of doing things on his own . he gets on top of a neighbor's roof and tears the balloon with a bow , defeating the witch . sorry , dad , he thought , and sat up , smiling . this time it's me out , alone , will decides as he prepares to face her 147 removing this scene from the movie prevents us from understanding that will is becoming more adventuresome . the film shows us many examples of will being afraid to follow jim , but never growing curious like his friend . in the book , will has both a good , quiet side and an evil , daring side like his jim . in the movie , each boy only has one mode of thought , which destroys bradbury's theme of both good and evil being present in each person . in the book , will saves jim because of their friendship , but , in the movie , charles halloway saves jim to repay jim's father . will pulls jim off the carousel in bradbury's novel because he doesn not want his best friend to grow up without him . it is the good in will , the fact that he cares about his friend , that saves jim from the evil curse of the carnival . on the carousel , jim gestured his other hand free to trail on the wind , the one part of him , the small , white , separate part that still remembered their friendship 269 this shows that there was good left inside of jim , which has the potential to still defeat evil . but when charles halloway saves jim in the movie , he does it to repay the debt he owes jim's father , who saved will when he was a little boy . by changing the motivation for saving jim , the filmmakers have ruined bradbury's original idea that it takes good to win against evil . in the end of the movie , the carnival is defeated by a tornado and lightning instead of smiles and laughter . when the book ends , mr dark turns himself into a little boy and charles halloway smiles and laughs at him so much that he can not stand it and evaporates . in bradbury's world , evil people feed off fear and can only be defeated by happiness and love . his message is that good will always prevail over evil , but only if that goodness is expressed outwardly . good to evil seems evil , says charles halloway as he holds the dying mr dark . so i will do only good to you , jed . i will simply hold you and watch you poison yourself 275 in the movie , mr dark is the only one left on the carousel when lightning hits it , and he dies . by eliminating the weapon of laughter and smiles , the filmmakers imply that bad weather is the most effective way to defeat evil , as if lightning only strikes those who are bad . this takes away the major theme of bradbury's book , which is that doing good toward others wards off evil . good may always triumph over evil , but trying to make movies more kid friendly will always force filmmakers to leave out some of the themes from the books they are based on . in the movie , something wicked this way comes , will does not transform , will's friendship does not save jim , and smiles and laughter do not defeat the carnival . as a result , the filmmakers have left out too many of bradbury's main points . the process of adapting a book to a movie too often ruins the world the author has established . in the case of this story , bradbury's frightening world of opposing forces of good and evil has been reduced to a tamer , simpler version of itself .
1			violence	strong	kari	gorgeous	felt	cheated			i bought this dvd because it has kari in it and the mpaa ratings said ; rated r for strong violence and sexuality , nudity and language . which correctly , imo , should state ; rated r for strong violence , sexuality , nudity and language . the word sexuality should come after a comma , not an and because of the huge difference in meaning it make . i think a lot of people who have watched this movie will agree with me that the sexuality and nudity parts almost non existent . my first impression when i look at the mpaa rating was that i will be watching something like vivid movie . that is why i felt cheated . story wise , it was so so , after all who really cares about the story if the gorgeous kari was in it . i know i don not . of course , this is only my opinion . joseph

the film is just plain wrong , and manages to get the most stupid , simple fact of the show totally incorrect by forgetting or ignoring that tom wopat & john schneider's bo & luke duke were reformed moonshiners . they had been busted , learned their lesson , gone straight , and were there to help people and be good neighbors who just happened to shoot dynamite tipped arrows from hunting bows & drive like steve mcqueen . denver pyle's uncle jessie was also the moral center of the family , always insisting that the boys do good , even at their own expense or embarrassment while he made sandwiches and coffee for when the chores were done . they always did the right thing and had a sort of earnest naivet about them that was quite appealing . we wanted to be more like them than we were , sorta . my favorite gimmick from the show was how they always buckled their seat belts before roaring off , which was apparently too moral for this film . by transforming the duke family into a pack of leering , wisecracking , criminally minded , redneck baiting , misogynistic losers the movie has no moral standpoint , where the show was all about how honest or incorruptible the dukes were are the duke boys in this movie supposed to come off as good guys ? i wanted to punch them both in the nose . they seem to have a lot of free time on their hands that could be spent doing chores back at the farm and end up pursuing less than noble ends , if not acting like a pair of 14 year old boys who haven not grown up . there should be no marijuana use , no gawking at buxom , nubile coeds & their breasts , no shenanigans involving the brothers in da hood . all of it looks like the work of a marketing consultant who took a poll at the mall of what 14 year old boys like to see in movies . the problem being that 14 year old boys cannot possibly remember the show , imho shouldn not be seeing this movie either , and the parents who might feel nostalgia for the show will be disgusted by what the writers , director & producers did to our collective memories just to part us from our money , which is exactly how i feel . what were they thinking ? ? and boy did they ever get daisy wrong . jessica simpson all dolled up like a pamela anderson mall slut may be the only reason for anyone to see this disgrace , but you can service your needs just fine downloading some promotional stills of her , printing them up & pinning them to the wall in a restroom . she is hardly in the film at all which is the movie's only saving grace , and the ten minutes or so they used her was still excessive . catherine bach's daisy may have had the same kind of shorts , and long legs that make people feel funny just looking at her , but the daisy she played was a person . the pratfalls she elicited by simply being who she was had an almost natural ring to it . she remains one of the most outrageously sexy pop culture icons ever created but there was somebody at home . and most importantly she was a sweet , caring person who couldn not help it if the guys went ga ga over her . by contrast , jessica simpson appears phony , contrived , made up , costumed , posed , aloof , bored , out of place , and i don not think she even looks that great in the outfit . she doesn not look like a person but a plot device , conjured up during a deal with someone representing her agent . ms simpson would be well advised to fire that person immediately and pretend like the whole thing never even happened . whatever the joke was , she isn not in on it and is disgracefully exploited for t&a . if that's all she wants from her career , executive produce the sequel if only to ensure yourself enough screen time at least , because this effort was just pathetic . the bottom line is skip it . for the cost of two tickets and a slurpee to go you can pick up one of warner bros . excellent box set collections of the original shows on dvd and the entire family can watch them together . that was why it worked . the only real purpose i can see in the film might be it's future use as an interrogation tool at guantanamo bay . twenty minutes of this & they will be singing a choir . 1 10 and i mean it . and stay the hell away from the bionic man , you schnooks .

1			child	dead	woman	dead	rip	horrible	feel	scared	seem	scary	zombies	poor			this movie may seem scary on commercials , but the actual movie was a reason to vomit . this is a below below average , even lower than that and has no plot . i mean every house can make you feel scared and sure , a dead japanese woman would scare the poop out of you , but so what ? make a movie that would appeal to watchers and not just show images of scared people and some hair dead japanese woman . can you say horrible rip off of samara the ring ? don not get me started with the dead child . not even that scary ! so what ? he has a cat and he can imitate it , big freaking deal ! just bury the poor zombies and save some lives that have the potential of being harmed by the grudge ! 1 10 yuck !
1			thumping	bible			before i me say that i fully believe in god . i believe in heaven and in hell . kay now that thats out of the way , i just wanna say that what in the world do these morons that call themselves hosts think they are doing ? the last time i checked a host doesn not discriminate , spew hatred filled rants on tv , or try to shove their own beliefs down every unfortunate soul that ventures onto the channel . all of these that crazy , idiotic , conservitive , bible thumping , fred phelps lover pat robertson does daily . i am all for free speech , but since when does that cover a guy who pretty much says that if you venture off his ideal way of life you are right away sent to hell ? this is just a perfect example of why religion is the cause of soooo many proble ms one day in my class room we had a substitute teacher in so we decided to watch some tv since the teach didn not give us any work . and we against many of us's will watched 700 s club , and of course that jerk pat was on ranting and raving about the bible , and he said simon along the lines of god says homosexuality is a sin and i actually heard a kid go hmm i guess he's right . wtf ? ? seriously , if the host is trying to make people think that someone else's sexual orientation is a huge sin , then they seriously need to take that host , duct tape them , and throw them off of a cruise liner in the middle of the arctic .

1			circus	real	toys	expensive	socialist	young	issues	important	it	appropriate	arguments	powerful			is there a movement more intolerant and more judgmental than the environmentalist movement ? to a budding young socialist joining the circus must seem as intimidating as joining a real circus . even though such people normally outsource their brain to hollywood for these important issues , the teachings of hollywood can often seem fragmented and confusing . fortunately ed is here to teach neo hippies in the art of envirojudgementalism . here you will learn the art of wagging your finger in the face of anyone without losing your trademark smirk . you will learn how to shrug off logic and science with powerful arguments of fear . you will learn how to stop any human activity that does not interest you by labeling it as the gateway to planetary armageddon . in addition to learning how to lie with a straight face you will also learn how to shrug off accusations that are deflected your way no matter how much of a hypocrite you are . you will be able to use as much energy as al gore yet while having people treat you as if you were amish . in the second season was even more useful as we were able to visit other hollywood gods , holy be thy names , and audit that is , judge their lifestyles . note this is the only time it's appropriate for an envirofascist to judge another because it allows the victim the chance to buy up all sorts of expensive and trendy eco toys so that they can wag their finger in other people's faces . what does ed have in store for us in season three ? maybe he will teach us how to be judgmental while sleeping !

1			rubbish	bad no	generation	stereotypical	acting	terrible			its one of those stereotypical mtv generation dance movies , and i do not see where all this its not that bad rubbish is coming from . the acting is terrible , it follows exactly the same storyline as all the other would ancing movies out there . its terrible ! the name should scream don not watch . how she move . since when can movie titles ignore grammar ? at least some dance movies had half decent dance scenes , these ones don not even deserve a watch . i give it a 1 out of 10 just because there is no zero . i seriously implore anyone with an iq of over 60 not to watch this , and not to waste your money . the 1.6 10 should tell it all . this movie should not have even be made .
1			expectations	low	me	awake	film	worst	it	best			i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made , when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of and it would be best to avoid it , but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends , i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film . the so called jokes in this film bring a cringe to the face , they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls , the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies . the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull . the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped . i never want to have to see this film again , i would rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again . if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face
1			plot	predictable	comparable	nice	bhaiyyaji	disappointed	english	bad	song	comparable	dialogs	pathetic			sometime i fail to understand what do the directors think when they make a movie . i had had a trauma after watching welcome 2007 and thought that they wont do it again . but after loads of amazing promos , tashan finally ended as heart attack . such amazing 3 songs in promo dil haara , chhaliya and tashan mein . . and what u get in the movie ? zero story , predictable plot , plenty of akshay kumar stunts and nothing interesting apart from watching kareena after her major weight loss . ! music wise another major disaster . in the music album , they have spent time on giving pathetic small dialogs of these 4 jokers and they haven not thought of giving the background song of the scenes when akshay kumar is doing stunts . that song is such nice , quite comparable to tashan mein and that is not taken in the music album ! ! if you plan to watch this movie , i would say , watch it to listen to that background song which goes something like . bachchan bachchan pandey . overall very disappointed even with the way bhaiyyaji has made attempt to speak bad english ! go away man , i need to puke !
1			logan	bored	i	ok	movie	boring	character	bored	he	gay			i read the half dozen other user comments on this board and it seems as though the opinions vary greatly . i have to agree with those who found this movie to be awful . it pains me to write that since i would have hoped this would have been great , or i wouldn not have bothered to see it the other day . i like supporting indie cinema , especially if they are gay themed , but this movie is almost too much to tolerate . those that walked out , as i considered doing after about three minutes , probably didn not mind shelling out $ 11.00 or just figured it was going nowhere , fast , and not going to improve . maybe i am slightly more optimistic than they are . either that or they didn not pay to get in in the first place . logan is bored . he's a klutz . he's gay . i m okay with that . the problem is that because the main character in a movie is bored does not necessarily mean that the movie about him has to be boring also ! there are endless scenes of this kid just laying around like a load of laundry , re establishing everything that you already learned in the first scene , and the second scene , etc , etc . nothing or no one goes anywhere . no one says anything even remotely insightful or funny or interesting . probably most appalling of all is that i didn not feel the slightest bit of empathy for logan . that in itself is a major accomplishment . he didn not grow , he didn not change , he didn not learn there is no one to teach him anything , he didn not do anything , and neither did the movie ! scene after scene of the same thing do not a movie make . additionally , the title makes no sense at all . 1 10

1			york	new	effort	noble	they	upset	one	poor			a noble effort , i guess , but ultimately a poor one . before seeing this film , i felt bartleby , the scrivener was unfilmable . after seeing it , i still do . unfortunately , i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on , and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions updating from 1850 to 1970 moving from new york to london . even the superb talents of paul scofield can not salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville's metaphysical classic .
1			western	good	ideas	bad	employee	bad	guy	bad			we rented the dvd hoping for a good western . the film was pretty and the scenes reasonable , but the ideas were very bad . here are my problems with the film . in the first part , why exactly did the bad guy kill the mine owner ? not really connected to the movie except to establish how bad he was and to have a hideout . the bank employee gone bad just acts too poorly to convincingly decide to hire killers to off his employers . at least keep us guessing . no character developed at all for the bank owners or the bank employee . very long delay in much of anything happening . absurd premise that martin still needed to see the judge after the gang confessed to killing the in laws . even more absurd that he confesses to judge and judge will not listen to the sheriff guy . even more ridiculous that martin his hung and rope breaks then the sheriff takes him at gunpoint to finally head back to his town and save his wife from the bad bank employee . wouldn not he just return after the quick dispatch of the gang to save wife and arrest bad bank guy ? just send the judge a note that gang confessed before being killed on trail ? ? ! overall , very sad acting and no point to movie .
1			rating	good no	character	mysterious	age	young	pace	tremendous	ideas	original	look	ridiculous	moments	atmospheric	cast	dull			the soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb . the soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy . one by one , the blood is drained from those involved in the dig . to be as brief as possible , pharaoh's curse is quite the lackluster affair . while the movie does present a few good , original ideas blood sucking mummy's , soul transference , interesting make up effects , the arm ripping scene , etc and a few atmospheric moments , the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding . to make matters even worse , the first 15 of the film's relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding . i usually go for these slow moving mummy movies , but pharaoh's curse tests even my patients . the cast helps very little . with only one exception ziva rodann is the lone bright spot wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character , the cast is as dull as the screenplay . finally , i don not know whose idea it was to put the mummy looking servant in what appears to be pajamas , but it's a laughable , ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience . despite my mostly negative comments on the pharaoh's curse , i m going to rate it a 4 10 not a good rating to be sure , but generous given all the problems i have with the movie .
1			stalker	potential	lessons	moral	dialogue	mediocre	citizen	good	job	good			i gave this more than a 1 because i did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and the acting and the dialogue were mediocre and i must confess i came out feeling like i had been beaten over the head with the god this , god that and christ is our saviour stuff . the movie and the story line did not need it . if , as i am , you are a recovering catholic or christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous . the movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been .

1			dentist	successful	monsters	little			there are probably more people afraid of the dentist than of , let's say , little monsters or scary looking dolls . which makes it a perfect subject for a horror movie , really . dr feinstone corbin bernsen has been a successful dentist for several years now , but when he catches his wife cheating on him with the poolguy he snaps , and he brings his anger and frustration to his work . well , give a mad dentist a drill and a mouth , and you can probably guess what happens next . as i said , brilliant idea but not delivered as well as it should . in particular the ending is a huge let down . last note watch for mark ruffalo you can count on me , eternal sunshine . in this one . 5 10
